0,LukeBro,Mar 9 at 2:29 AM,5,I'm addicted!,"I love the workouts on this app! 
You can tell that the developers, the instructors, and the entire team put a lot of effort into delivering this quality program. I enjoy the versatility of the workouts, the music, and how engaging they feel. I feel the burn after I do the workouts and I upgraded to the yearly membership. Working out has been a challenge after undergoing cancer treatment but I'm cancer free now and with renewed energy to exercise with this app. (I use my son's Oculus to do the workouts while he's in school :) I don't usually write reviews but I'm just a happy consumer who is enjoying working out again because of this app."
1,Jasiah Kent,Mar 8 at 6:55 PM,5,,"This app is awesome fr, I can get an easy cardio session in to help me with my cut and I have to say it is helping, I especially love the boxing mode, it‚Äôs very fun and gives me a good workout leaving my whole body sore, especially my upper body from punching, but I rlly recommend this game to everyone who wants to get into cardio or lose weight and doesn‚Äôt have access to a gym or has bad anxiety running outside in public or going out in the gym with people"
2,Darius,23 days ago,5,100% Worth the subscription fee,"I saw this and gave it a go. I was hooked almost immediately. I've never liked the gym, not interested in running or anything like that. I did several martial arts for quite some time but due to my job, finding the time and motivation to train was tough. VR exercise is something I'd never thought of until this popped up as a suggestion. I find myself making time to exercise and I genuinely look forward to it. I've only done the boxing and HIIT so far and love it. I'm doing between 40mins minimum a day because I'm that addicted. I cannot comment on weight loss personally but my brother works out with me in multiplayer rooms. He's gone from 130kg to 108kg... with a good diet of course. it honestly doesn't feel like a workout when you're enjoying yourself. 
Most gym memberships near me go for ¬£40-¬£60per month so ¬£60 a year fee if naff all. 

If you're still not happy with the price, les Mills body combat is also another great workout. No multiplayer functions or as many new classes added but the principle remains the same. 

Hope this helps!"
3,BabyBeast,22 days ago,5,Get fit at a great price,"I found this on the meta store because I love boxing and honestly I was pleasantly surprised with the game. It has so many different songs, movements and game versions to get you moving alone or my favorite to battle against other people. This game challenges you to be the best you. Spend the 9.99 a month and get the full game because the songs and workouts are worth it. You can‚Äôt get a gym membership for that cheap. I also love you can choose which body part to target and the length you want it when you need just a quick workout. Just try the 7 day trial if you don‚Äôt believe me. You‚Äôll love it and feel the burn in no time."
4,Kaiti,22 days ago,5,Best fitness app for the money!,"I‚Äôve been using this app to make exercise fun for about 4 months now. In that time I‚Äôve lost nearly 50 pounds. Before using this app I could never stick to any workout routine. This is the longest I‚Äôve ever stuck to any sort or workouts. I find the videos fun and engaging, it is very user friendly, and I can form workouts that are perfect for me with different lengths, hardness levels, and warmups or cool downs. I love that they put up new videos so often and that they have enough trainers to have someone perfect for every user. Hands down my top fitness app and I have recommended it several times."
5,Todd171015,22 days ago,5,FitXR Changed My Perspective,"When playing about on the VR with my family at Christmas, my watch bleeped at me to say how my heart rate had gone up to tell me I was ‚Äúworking out‚Äù 

New year came and it was a game changer! Dry January gave me time to fill so I started using the app daily, I immediately subscribed and thought I‚Äôd see how I got on, I‚Äôm addicted, I‚Äôve never felt so good and I can do it all from home, pushing myself as and when I want to.

Would recommend to anyone and everyone!"
6,Aletha,Mar 10 at 3:17 PM,1,Unethical,"DO NOT TRY ANYTHING ‚ÄúFREE‚Äù UNLESS YOURE SURE YOURE WILLING TO PAY FULL PRICE!I signed up for the seven day trial. I used it a few times and it was decent, but definitely not worth paying $84 for. I specifically took note that I was informed I would be given a warning before my free trial was ending. I checked my email consistently and never received this morning, but woke up this morning to an email saying my account have been charged for the $84 annual subscription. neither fit XR nor meda quest Provided any information about how this was just automatically going to charge my account. I did opt into the emails so the fact that I didn‚Äôt receive one is ridiculous.Ôøº"
7,Es-Aart,Feb 20 at 6:07 PM,5,Bought it after 600+ hours playtime,"So I first discarded this game for other, free, alternatives, which often worked in the VR browser. Then at some point I decided to give it a try and that's when I realized that it's actually free-to-play for everyone with more than enough free classes. You don't need a subscription to get fit with this!

At some point, I saw a notification about the time spent in this game (meaning cardiovascular activity for me, most sweaty I think I ever got was while boxing). This was 600 hours, while I previously did not do ANY cardio. That's when I thought: whenever I get a bit bored by the free levels, I will buy a subscription. More than 2 months later, after going at it twice a week, that time came and I immediately bought it. Even though it's expensive, I now do cardio, which I think makes it definitely worth it.

Oh, one thing I would really like added: just a beautiful scenery with nature and no gym-like environment."
8,Bb,Mar 1 at 1:22 PM,5,Game changer!,I have always been a huge lover of fitness but had recently lost motivation at the gym. FITXR has been such a game changer. I play this every day and it‚Äôs actually pushed my fitness further than ever before but most importantly it is FUN! I love everything about this app. I like that you can choose your intensity for each session and that it has a ranking system for the competitive people like me!! I‚Äôve purchased similar apps to this but I have to say that this one knocks the others out the park! Looking forward to getting even fitter and having even more fun!
9,Codi Woods,7 days ago,5,Been here since BoxVR,"UPDATE: IT STILLL ROCKS! I refuse to give up it's just THAT good. New daily workouts it's perfect for me and will be for you. I especially love HIIT

Absolutely love everything about FitXR, I was already set on subbing since I was an original player on BoxVR on PsVR and wow this is an upgrade!!! I am a daily user and plan on keep showing up!!!! One tiny complaint, I'm trying to buy the boxing bundle with the shirt, cooling towel and wrist weights but cannot checkout?? What's going on? Thanks for the amazing program though!"
10,Amber,Mar 18 at 3:36 AM,5,So motivated to work out with FitXR,"This game has finally given me the motivation to WANT to work out. I love the variety in classes!  I tried both FitXR and Supernatural and I'm happy to say I will be sticking to FitXR.  Supernatural has better music and graphics, however I feel like the classes in FitXR are more rounded and I can get a good work out to multiple different areas of the body. Also I love the multi-player function. The leader boards really motivate you to do better to try and be at the top of the leader boards!!"
11,Becky,Feb 24 at 12:13 AM,5,Fantastic fun and effective üòÄ,"Brought the quest 2 for Christmas and purchased FitXR, been hooked ever since. Needed to increase my conditioning after focusing on strength for a while for my upcoming army assessment. 

Since starting at beginning of January my endurance has improved greatly. 

It's very fun and addicitive, being able to compete with others is also a winner for me as I'm competitive and will push myself more to get to 1st place. 

Boxing and combat are my favourite, i always start off with a couple of Hiit classes to get warmed up. 

It's so convenient to get home from work and jump on the oculus rather than having to travel to the gym. 

Easy to follow so if you are new to exercising you can't go wrong with this.

The only thing i will say if you are trying to lose weight and calorie counting, the cals the exercises say you burn are very inaccurate more so than your fitness watches so do not consume the cals you burn.

Happy exercising!"
12,CeliaSue,Feb 14 at 4:10 AM,5,Virtual Workout Party!,"So far, I‚Äôm loving FitXR! I moved to a new city but still get to do fun workouts with my friends. The workouts are fun while adding a little competition to keep us motivated! 

There are so many types of workouts to choose from that we never get bored or burnt out. Sometimes we forget we are working out and not having game night. Highly recommend!"
13,Robin ten Dam,Feb 21 at 11:39 PM,5,Great game,"The workouts are really intense. There are many events and seen alot of updates  since i have the game (1month). 

What i miss - Scheluded training
More scenery's. (there are like five of them). 

I do say older reviews are outdated since the game had some great updates."
14,Cole,Feb 17 at 2:56 AM,5,Absolutely love it!!,I have been working out with FitXR faithfully with a minimum of 4 days and 10 minutes each day since September 3rd 2022. So far i have lost 40 lbs along with a diet. I love working out with Billy and hos Boxing and now with the combat! Once I got use to the workout I mix them up and workout longer. When I first started I never thought i would be able to workout for 30-45 minutes straight. I love it!
15,StewWalton,Mar 18 at 1:57 PM,5,Love the app. Strava integration is poo,"5* app. Love it. Helped me shed a LOT of excess timber. Was excited to see Strava integration. Reality of it (so far) is that it dumps an image (not of the actual game you just played, they posted someone called ‚ÄòRay‚Äô screenshot on my Strava page. The metric captured are a guess of calories burned. It‚Äôs not useful in current form. 

Keep working on it guys. I love the idea. Ask for my Apple Watch data. I‚Äôll share it! Get some heart rate zone insights. 

Whilst I‚Äôm here, more long workouts please or at least ability to make a playlist.  Thanks a lot."
16,ProcoMel,Jan 18 at 3:15 AM,5,30 Pounds Down,"I bought Quest2 in February and FitXR next.   I started with boxing and worked out every day starting approx. 15 minutes.  I was delighted with the workouts and quickly included HIIT for an extra 15.  Before long, doing 45 minute sessions in combinations of the two.  I will be 72 in June and never ever had such success with my workouts as I have had with FitXR.  I'm down 30 pounds from about 170 to 140 or less.  Two pant sizes later and even 8s are a bit loose.  I have better balance and I'm stronger all the way around.  I bound up the steps two at a time and my energy level is better than ever."
17,Leda Cressida,Feb 11 at 4:56 PM,5,Addictive workouts,"I've worked out many decades using traditional gyms, specialized gyms, recorded fitness videos, other meta fitness apps and taken many live aerobic classes but fit xr is my favorite.  You can work out whenever you want for short bursts or longer. You hit targets that create entertaining breaking sounds and there's a scoring system for those of us obsessed with numbers and competition. I highly recommend this app."
18,Paul,6 days ago,5,Part of my exercise routine,"I am 75 years old and I absolutely love FitXR.  I have been doing the workouts for 2 months about 5-6 days a week.  I have to say that I truly look forward to doing FitXR.  It has been the most enjoyable exercise routine that I have ever experienced.  That is really a first for me because exercise has always been a necessary daily part of my life but not always a very enjoyable experience.  Not anymore with FitXR.  My favorite is the boxing.  So I can't speak about the other exercise modalities.  I  prefer the easy and intermediate classes.  There is such an amazing variety in each different workout.  The trainers, the different lengths of classes, the music and all the different parts of my body that get a great workout makes FitXR my favorite exercise app.  I also enjoy using the app BeatSaber almost everyday as well, but it is such a different type of workout and much less intense than FitXR.  I have tried about 5 other exercise apps, but there was always something about each one that made me love FitXR even more.  I would highly recommend FitXR."
19,Tay,Feb 17 at 2:47 PM,5,"Don't look at reviews, just try it.","Look, I'm new to this thing. But I can honestly say, if you follow their workouts, you can easily loose weight and become stronger. 

I did a 15 minute workout earlier this week and couldn't walk for two days. (Yes I'm unfit)

Take this review how you wish, but I just want to say, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS."
20,Scotto,Jan 30 at 9:45 PM,5,Worth the sub,"I did the 7 day trial and decided to sub.  So much content and now all the different types of workouts.  Plus i am more motivated to workout when i know i spent money lol. Only thing it needs is a global leaderboards after each class, so i can see where i ranked vs the world not just 7 random people"
21,zar,19 days ago,5,Best overall VR Fitness App,"Ive tried this, Supernatural, Powerbeats, Les Mills, so I'll compare them below. I've seen many people mentioning Beat Saber and Synth Riders games in these reviews which isn't relevant because these two games are very mild forms of exercise. However I'll be recommending more game-like exercise apps at the bottom.

Supernatural: Subscription based fun and intensive app. Class options are flow (the standard slash, tilt and duck movements) and boxing. Many mainstream music options (Ariana Grande, the Weeknd, etc) which most apps dont have. Personally the music to me wasnt the empowering feel but more so popular radio hits, but this is a personal preference as to how you want to feel. Multiple coaches available. You do not have choice over environment and the options are limited but the ones they do include are beautiful nature based. It does have meditation too which is cool though i tried one meditation and it was uneffective and the speaker didnt seem experienced, but not what i tried the app for anyways so doesnt really matter. $19 a month is insane so I'll never buy this after the trial.  Full body workout.
Overall pros: fun game, good exercise, motivating coaches
Cons: expensive, music not as empowering, environment, less variety compared to FitXR

Powerbeats: worst VR exercise game right now. Bored after just playing one level but gave it a chance by trying a few. Mostly just consists of swatting balls out the way, no kind of coaching, poor music options, poor environment options,  customizable yes but a good app should have adequate base options too. MAYBE the game gets more fun as you unlock more levels (you have to start out beginner) but every other app already has everything unlocked and ready. Overrated on Meta Quest app but appropriately rated on Youtube. light intensity.
Pros: customizable
Cons: music, environment, gameplay

FitXR: BEST OVERALL. A subscription based app with the most amount of various class-types and one of the only fitness apps that let's you have full choice over your environment options and having many choices to choose from (though I hope they'll add a nature based one!) You can use filters to choose the genre of music (different classes have different genres assigned), length of exercise, type of class, the difficulty and it'll show you the options. Many types of exercise such as boxing, dance, HIIT, combat etc. I do wish they had kicking function in the combat. Multitude of coaches available (some classes show the actual coach, some show a kind of cartoon like version of them which can. look kinda weird). Fun and empowering. Full body workout.
Pros: empowering music, fun, good exercise, variety, environment choices
Cons: could use 1 or 2 more functions in combat

Les Mills: this is fun and I like the (pre determined) music which changes based on the class you choose. The class options all have similar structures. I like the knee-hits, I haven't seen any other exercise game have that move yet. There are environment options such as city, space etc though it doesn't change your whole environment, just the sides. Your front environment always remains the same (a studio-like room). This app feels more boxing focused besides the knee hits even though it is advertised as combat. However this is the app I'd recommend if you DONT want to pay for a subscription since it is FAR superior to  Powerbeats. Full body workout though more focus on upper body.
Pros: fun, good exercise, knee-hit option, empowering music
Cons: environment visibility, variety

RHYTHM EXERCISE GAMES RECOMMENDATIONS (no coaching or classes):

Audio trip: though this is more marketed as a rhythm game because there's no gym feel (no coaching or types of classes) instead  you just choose the song you want and change the settings based on the intensity..  it is a great full body workout that can be just as demanding, if not more than all the other apps ive mentioned. GREAT workout. I do like the existing music options but they are quite limited and the DEVs rarely update it. There are no environment change options (though they provide really cool, neon or futiristic pre determined ones).  If you want lots of exercise and really want to feel the beat, I'd recommend this. I use this and fitXr together.
Pro: fun, good exercise
Cons: music and environment variety

Pistol Whip: this game is very intensive and difficult even on the easy setting. It's super fun and makes you feel really cool because you shoot and move to the beat of the music. Like Audio Trip, this game won't give you a gym feel/doesn't have any coaching or sense of classes but will build your endurance immensely! The songs are associated with the Level so you can choose what sounds good before playing that one, though no separate music choices. 
Pros: fun, good exercise, unique music
Cons: will take a lot of tries to get a good score"
22,Kacpla,Feb 26 at 10:37 PM,5,Improved greatly,I bought it last year and used it for a month but dropped it. Coming back a later it‚Äôs changed massively for the better! It can help you get moving for a small monthly fee which I think is fair. Definitely worth a free trial!
23,Julien Van Hoorne,Feb 2 at 2:34 PM,5,Perfect (from a larva in sports so...).,"I wanted so badly to go to the gym and even boxing. 
The thing is, like many others, i lack the motivation to commute, prepare myself, going there, train then take a shower, come back home. 

This app brings the entire box lessons, trainings in combat, training to the music.
Hundreds of hours of lessons from beginner to advanced people, online with others or solo. 
Different kind of training settings : different coaches, each their own personality and so reflect on the training, different kinds of music from hip hop to rock and pop, electro, mixes, all adapted to the music tempo which is easier. 

These are real exercises not some random game. You can really train at home, a complete training of different kinds from box to endurance courses,etc. 

Regarding the subscription fees, it's cheaper than any gym subscription fees and to me, it's better because you can do any kind of training from home or the morning before going to work or so which is easier for us. The gym coaches come to your house, pick one, pick a kind of training, your lvl, the duration, the coach, the music and let's go !

I'm really not into sport games (or sport of any kind) but I thought I'd give it a try.... This is not a game, it's an awesome way to train at home as seriously as at the gym but from your living room.

Plus: always new event and content.

To the developper: Thank you very much for your work. You managed to make me be active and with fun on the top of that. Since it's from home, no more excuses :D You did a great job ! All my best regards to the team. Keep making us such good content.

Ps: I'd like to apologize for my English but it's not my mother language, i try my best to make myself understood but surely with big mistakes. So sorry but at least you got the main idea lol"
24,Slybaby101,Feb 9 at 9:36 PM,5,Motivational and fun,"This game is fun and you get a great workout without realizing it. I work out often and enjoy different types of workouts and this VR game is a great addition to my routine.

There are many levels to choose from and a lot of good music. I like the filtering options so you can choose what you want to do. 

I tried this game and Les Mills. Les Mills was a good workout but not my vibe. I found that game annoying and usually turned off the sound. FitXR doesn‚Äôt try to be hardcore and lets you choose your workout mood."
25,Stara,Jan 7 at 5:55 PM,5,I subscribed üí™üèª for positive vibes!,"I really enjoyed the 7-day trial and found it more worthwhile than having a gym membership. I dislike commuting and exercising with other people, so this is perfect for me. What I like most is how the music synchronizes so well with the moves, which makes it fun and motivating. I was hesitant to bop to the music when boxing cos my avatar would be recorded, but when I turned around, at least 2 others were unabashedly dancing away üòÇ so after that I just let go and had fun!

There are difficulty levels and lengths of class to choose from, so I can do whatever I feel like doing that day. During my trial, the sculpt classes got released, which assured me that the developers are constantly improving and coming up with new content. I also enjoyed their collections - classes from Black History Month was like a mini lesson which I found really cool. 

I also like the diverse group of coaches who each have their own styles, but are all extremely motivating and positive. Sometimes they say funny spontaneous stuff which I'd love to hear more of (someone mentioned their grandma's duck!). 

There are certainly still kinks here and there - the animation can be improved; locations are limited; I had some tracking issues during HIIT classes; only English songs - no K or J-pop etc.; not enough Lady Gaga (personal opinion üòÜ). But overall, this is still a wonderful app that's really worth the time. 

Lastly, for those who had issues cancelling the subscription, that's because subscriptions are managed in the Quest app under Settings->Subscription! I cancelled (easily) during Day 1 of my trial (the 7-day trial remained) and subscribed (easily) after my trial ended. Pls be kind to the developers because maybe this is something that's not entirely under their control."
26,Dogman,Jan 25 at 1:12 AM,5,"Abandoned Fitxr 18 months ago, now back","What a pleasant surprise,. I abandoned Fitxr 18 months ago, shortly after they introduced HIIT, becoming a Supernatural subscriber.  SN for me has become a little stale, I follow FitProvr on YouTube who suggested I re-engage.

I own over 100 apps, none has seen the improvement of Fitxr.  The addition of Sculpt and especially Combat studios add an element of variety to my workouts that is game changing.  Now Fitxr has four studios that are excellent (box, HIIT, sculpt, combat) that allow me to spin a mix of them for a great workout.  

The instructions are good, but fortunately can now be COMPLETELY TURNED OFF,  if you prefer.  Flexibility in how you map a workout in Fitxr is outstanding.  Although the music is not at Supernatural level it also is much improved.

If you left Fitxr for greener pastures before, now is a great time to jump back in.  Sayonara Supernatural.  Am now a happy annual Fitxr subscriber."
27,AnDreS,Mar 13 at 4:16 PM,5,Second VR workout I've tried,"But this one gets the hard W. So many options and the workouts feel fun and very diverse. Highly recommend!

28,Ryman,10 days ago,1,Charged me for free month,"I got charged despite it being a free trail month. The app layout is poor, the trainers are twee and irritating, and talk nonsense, some of which I think is technically not valid. Some of the games seem a bit broke. Weird 1990s lawnmower man trainer avatars. Meta need to bring out some decent fitness apps, seem to have been stuck with the same 2 in the UK for far too long. The music suuuucks. I don't get why they market these things to gym people when gym people are happy going to the gym?"
29,Karen,Feb 16 at 3:45 AM,5,"Amazing, fun workouts",I really love this program. I use the box and combat workouts the most. The trainers are awesome and motivating. The workouts are fun and entertaining. You really work up a sweat. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even realize I am working out because I am having so much fun.
30,Rick Lawrence,Jan 29 at 9:32 AM,5,Exceeded expectations!,"What started as a rainy day substitute for an outdoor run, with the 7-day free trial, ended with a new mode of working out. I fully expected to try it once and cancel before being charged, but it was so much more engaging than I could ever imagine! 

I got what I came for: lots of sweat, elevated heart rate, and elevated respiratory rate.

I also got more than I bargained for with all the different levels of intensity and muscle engagement!

The tweaks and updates coming to the app are reassuring that this platform will only get bigger and better.

This is one subscription I gladly pay!"
31,Reese,Feb 11 at 12:43 AM,5,I feel lighter already!,I wanted to be pushed to workout every day and this is exactly what this app did! Because of the subscription I feel the need to really make the most of it. It has changed my life! I completed 9 days straight of working out with this game so far‚Ä¶. and I repeat each intermediate to advanced boxing class a couple of times to really kick my own a**! I hope I can lose 30 lbs in a few months. üôèüèº Thanks Fit XR team! Y‚Äôall are changing lives.
32,Roshlyn,A day ago,5,This is THE Exercise App,"I got a headset to exercise, to live a healthier life and lose weight. I tried 3 or 4 apps before I found FitXR, and it is the best one. I use it almost every day. Sometimes it's just a quick 5 minute HIIT or Combat session - other times it's a full hour in different studios - wow am I glowing after a Sculpting session! The music is great, the trainers are fabulous, the environment is engaging. Worth the price of subscription. Better than a gym."
33,Mica,Jan 18 at 2:33 AM,5,"Look, no one likes subscription's but...","Updating in light of recent updates. I am in awe of the updates that keep coming. I genuinely feel like my subscription is worth it. This new combat collection is excellent and I can't wait for more advanced classes to come out. I hope they incorporate even more strikes and features to flesh out the feature set. 

I've been using fitxr since just after the box VR rebrand, bought all the DLCs and saw some slow but steady improvements. Now that they have the funding from recurring payments I feel like this last update is finally the one where we're getting what we're paying for. The instructors are giving serious attention to detail in the workouts, the music choices are dramatically improving, and the changing scenery keeps it fresh. This game kept the covid 20 lbs off me and I think it's really worth it"
34,DavidE,Jan 29 at 2:03 AM,5,highly recommended!!!!!!,Unfortunately I can only give it 5 stars but it's worth 20 it's great if you're looking to burn calories and have fun at the same time I've had it for a year and the improvements are getting better for example the combat and box classes are incredible and the music is very varied I hope the developers continue working on the app as up to now highly recommended
35,Naomi,Jan 12 at 4:29 PM,5,Great start to my fitness journey,"I didn‚Äôt know what to expect when I first got FitXR, but I am absolutely loving the classes! I‚Äôve even managed to jump from Beginner Box to Intermediate in just a few weeks. My new favourite is the Sculpt classes, you can really feel the burn even days after working out!
I used the mobile app to keep track and set my goal of working out 3 days a week, but I‚Äôm already using this way more! 
Can‚Äôt wait to see what more classes come in the future!"

Here is the link: https://tr.ee/mVv3qBubbL


My experience with the game was quite nice. There is really nothing to complain about! The combination of music, instructor and trivial but can exhausting exercises really does the job! In my opinion, it is really worth buying goggles for this game or trying it out if you have one! 

Cheers!"
37,Catherine Muckle,2 days ago,5,Obsessed!!!,"I am loving this app! Short challenging workouts totally tailored to any level! You‚Äôve access to so much and it is definitely worth it! My favourite studios are the dance and sculpt studios and my body feels the challenge of box, hiit and combat! 

Amazing amazing amazing!"
38,Bluesky,7 days ago,5,FIT XR,"This app is the real deal. I workout on this app 2 or 3 xs aday. It's fun but it can get intense. You can work your upper body or your lower body or both. You will start to feel your body getting into better shape.  
I recommend this app for young adults and up, im 64 yrs old and I love it. My son got me this meta Oculus because i was watching tv all day since i retired. I can feel the difference since I started a few weeks ago and it's only getting easier and better. My arms, neck and shoulders feel so good and the aches and pains are gone. My  hips, lower back and thighs get a good workout as well. You will wake up each morning excited to get your workout in....have a great time."
39,Thearecade,Jan 12 at 8:22 PM,5,Been playing since the early days,"So I first experienced BoxVR way before VR Fitness was even popular. Back then it was pretty basic, but Its been really cool to see it evolve into FitXR.

With that evolution its brought improvements in my experience as someone who exercises 3-4 times a week in VR. I value the HIIT and boxes classes the most personally! I enjoy how the constant updates keep it fresh.

I also love fitxr for the multiplayer.  While I haven't done it often, just the ability to exercise with a friend remotely was awesome, and I very much recommend.   It was like being able to meet up for a class without needing to drive all the way.  

Can't wait to see new studios and music!"

I recently tried out FitXR, and I have to say, I'm really impressed! This virtual reality fitness app is a game-changer for anyone who wants to get in shape while having fun at the same time.

One of the things I loved about FitXR is the sheer variety of workouts available. From boxing to dancing to HIIT, there's something for everyone. I also appreciated how the app provides real-time feedback on metrics like speed, accuracy, and calories burned. It's a great way to track progress and stay motivated.

But what really sets FitXR apart is the immersive, 360-degree environments. Whether you're in a boxing ring or a dance club, you feel like you're really there. The graphics are stunning, and the music is perfectly synced to the workouts.

I also loved the multiplayer mode, which allowed me to compete against other users in real time. It added an extra level of excitement and motivation to my workouts.

Overall, I highly recommend FitXR to anyone who wants to stay active and healthy in a fun and engaging way. The app is easy to use, the workouts are challenging yet rewarding, and the immersive environments are truly breathtaking. Give it a try ‚Äì you won't be disappointed!"
41,shakawando,Mar 9 at 9:59 PM,1,LACKING EXPERT BOXING LEVELS!!!,"THE GAME IS GOOD BUT NOT ENOUGH EXPERT LEVEL AND THEY ALL ARE REALLY TOO SHORT!!! 

COMBAT MODE IS COOL BUT THERE ARE ZERO EXPERT LEVEL AND THE ADVANCED ONES ARE REALLY TOO SHORT AND TOO EASY!!!!

THEY SAY THEY GET DAILY LEVEL BUT NOT FOR EXPERT ...

I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR EXPERIENCED FIGHTER ....

I CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION FOR THESE REASON BECAUSE ITS EASY TO ADD A TONS OF EXPERT LEVEL !! SO THERES NO EXCUSES!!

AND FOR THE FITXR DEVELOPMENT TEAM IF YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO CREATE NEW ONE JUST IMPORT BOXVR EXPERT LEVEL INTO FITXR AND I WILL RESUME MY SUBSCRIPTION SO PLEASE DO SOMETHING BECAUSE YOUR GAME HAVE POTENTIAL !!!

NOW THE GOOD PART IS THE TRAINER ARE ALL AWESOME AND ALMOST ALL EXPERT LEVEL ARE FUN SO ITS UP TO YOU üòä!"
42,ansonort,Mar 12 at 1:14 PM,4,I‚Äôve changed my mind,"I have a feeling that this game has gone through more than a couple of owners. I know that there were tremendous amounts of negative reviews when it moved from the original BoxVR to FITVR. Then, another outcry when the game went to the dreaded subscription base. 

Thank goodness I‚Äôd made some purchases before it went to the subscription model, and all my purchases survived the shift. 

Last summer I joined a gym. The subscription was ¬£30 per month. In the end I gave it up because, 1) it was too expensive for me to carry on with that outlay and 2) the workout room was full of muscle-bound blokes trying desperately to establish their singularly massive testosterone levels on anyone within their range. 

So I‚Äôve come back to FIT. I‚Äôm running the long, intermediate boxing levels and, if what I see is believable, burning as many calories as I used to on the treadmill for 30 minutes. 

I haven‚Äôt gone the subscription route with this game because I don‚Äôt have the room space - especially ceiling height - to do some of the other choices. Boxing is fine because my arms are moving laterally, but anything that takes my controllers more than 12 inches above my head - CLANG. This is actually a shame, because a monthly subscription is a third the price of my gym membership. 

Oh, and one thing more: like my gym the emphasis is almost wholly on physical fitness . Mental health is such an essential part of our overall health these days (so much stress and anxiety in the world), perhaps there could be some yoga and/or mindfulness sessions? Just a thought (excuse the pun)."
43,Mortlake,Feb 4 at 6:45 PM,1,Very sneaky app,Still cannot find how to unsuscribe. Just charged me 84$ after a year without any warning.  I don't use the app at all. Even Amazon gives my money back if l don't use their services and request a refund.  Here l cannot do that. Unsuscribing should be as easy as subscribing. I want my money back.
44,Steph,21 days ago,5,Best workout app!,"So many workouts to choose from with different styles and trainers. Something for everyone and every ability. The workouts are fun but challenging and help motivate you to progress with your fitness. 
Would definitely recommend!"
45,Mike,Jan 23 at 10:53 AM,5,Perfect escape for me,"I had so much fun during 7-day trial. I would not feel comfortable in any gym surrounded by people so this app seems like the best ""place"". Gave me quite the workout. 

Even though it's fun, I will not pay for another subscription. 10$ a month is almost nothing, but too much just to play a game and not owning it."
46,2bluediamonds,Mar 6 at 11:46 AM,5,Awesome work outs,"I really like it
The fun of it. How i sweat much!! Hiit are my favorite!! Only one problem i noticed it's calories count... Totally random and not logic i think."

48,Liz,Jan 14 at 8:45 AM,5,Challenging and unique workouts!,"I'm a huge fan of Supernatural, the other subscription-based fitness VR app, but after trying FitXR, I have to say that if I have to pick between the two, at this point I'd pick FitXR.

Supernatural has much better music, but that is its only main strength over FitXR. Otherwise, FitXR's studios in general offer a better fitness experience. I feel like the Box studio is more challenging and inspires me to hit a lot harder than Supernatural's boxing, the Sculpt studio is really unique and I can totally feel the burn, and the HIIT studio completely takes advantage of VR and is so fun and challenging. I've tried almost every fitness game on the market, I've not found anything else quite like it.

It seems FitXR is also getting ready to launch a new studio called Combat, which I can't wait to try.

I'd use Supernatural when I want to an easier workout session to my favorite music, but if I want to be challenged and feel my body burning, I'd come to FitXR."
49,Echo,15 days ago,5,I can finally say I love working out!,"I have tried different methods to work out after my big pandemic weight gain with no luck, even with a life coach to push me. I hated the workouts more than felt good about it and I felt the best when they were OVER. My grandmother gifted me a Meta Quest 2 and I so happened to run into FitXR and gave it a try. I LOVED IT! It has been such a fun weight loss journey with classes that make me forget I'm working out a lot of the time because I'm so busy trying to succeed at the game and get a cool score. Every mode and class has been enjoyable to me, doing this regularly while wearing a sauna top gives me really noticeable results- something I didn't get from the gym. I can see the tone, and my tank top straps started all just falling off my shoulders which was a huge shock to me. 10/10 all around<3"
50,KatC,15 days ago,5,Worth the subscription!,"Got the Quest 2 for Christmas and tried FitXR & Supernatural first.  After a day I knew I would go with FitXR.  I take some sort of class every day - boxing, combat, hiit, sculpt - I definitely don't have what it takes to get through the dancing! All of them can be as challenging or as easy as you want them to be.  Love love love this app."
51,Nuoance,Jan 12 at 9:47 PM,5,Something I can do at home~,"I work remotely, and have spent a bit of time on Workout Games in VR. My problem is they're always just...10 or so classes, and thats the end of that. FitXR Continuously adds more programs and workouts throughout the month to make sure you're always having something new to do. I've spent a few hours in the application now, and also got my friend to join me for bi-weekly workouts. Its a lot more fun with a friend!

Pros: 
-Workout literally anywhere with the quest's portability. No extra gear required. 
-Workout at your own pace in privacy without feeling pressured to push yourself too hard.
-All workouts are run by a professional, either Olympic Boxers, Dancers, Heavy Weights, you name it. Both female and male.
-The app is constantly updating new workouts, so if you've run out, there will be more to do in a few days.
-There are different level of difficulty for every type.
-Cheaper than most Gym Memberships

Cons:
-Its only on the quest. I prefer my Index a lot more as it is much more comfortable to me, though this is a more personal gripe (steam port when???) If there ever was a way to play on other VR types, I hope that one account covers all.
-Even though there are a TON of workout programs, I've already had the same ""mini-workout"" more than once. For example, if I do boxing, it will come with 3 or 4 different songs to box to, but if I did another boxing lesson, maybe the 3rd song from the previous one is now the first song to work out to, with 2,3, and 4 being different. I know reusing previous workouts is a good idea, but I'm adding it as a con just in case you're expecting COMPLETELY different workouts each time. Its only for 1-2 minutes, and its never the same grouped over and over to my knowledge.
-I wish there were more workout mini-games during each segment. Its the same 10 or so movements over and over to different songs. Boxing makes sense, but a bit more variety with dance or HIIT would be nice."
52,Edrio,2 days ago,1,Lack of communication (SNEAKY TACTICS),"I'm currently using Supernatural since October and I love it, now that I'm practicing martial arts I thought of giving this app a try and got the 7 days trial, but I never got any advanced notification before Meta charged my credit card for a full-year subscription. I requested a refund and the support agent  said that according to the policy I did not qualify for a refund and the only thing I could do was to cancel the subscription so I will not get charged again at the end of the subscription. I guess I'm stuck with this app for a year, and let me tell you this app is far from being like Supernatural, the workout scenes are horrible and the coaches are so bad that, what they said makes no sense,  I  tried the app for the combat and they have almost nothing about combat routines. the coaches avatars at the end of each routine are terrible bad quality 3d animation. and one of the coaches said at the end of the routine.  I'm coach bla bla and that's the truth, I do not know where they find these coaches but the owners of this app should look at the Supernatural app and see how they have done such outstanding work with routines and coach selections. For now, I will try to use the app, so my money does not go to waste. hopefully, I will be able to mute those coaches' voices"
53,ossi,Jan 4 at 7:12 PM,5,My favourite fitness app so far,"Tried a few fitness apps but this one I like the most so far. Great motivator to get me up from the couch, - even on days when workout is the very last I would feel like doing. On those days, I look at it as a game.
The app is taken good care of the developers and always improving and they are doing a great job. 
It is a great choice either if someone just wants to do some exercise or if they use it additionally besides doing other sports.
For its price in my country, it is a lot cheaper than a gym, so also saving money.
In short: I love it and do recommend to others."
54,Oofgirlslayy,5 days ago,5,"Buy it , you won‚Äôt regret it !","I love FitXR , well worth the monthly subscription and with it I am able to get in my workouts daily .

I decided to try it again over the wkend 2 freaking days..I'm sore!! Love the hit classes never did it before.  Always did the boxing class.  I do alot of the super natural, body combat, tennis. I've tried almost all the fitness apps. So far I found this app, the body combat, super natural are really good..Liteboxer, to me not worth it."

58,Kimmie Coe,6 days ago,4,Great to have a workout buddy,"I recently moved away from my sister, and our weight-loss buddy system started to decline. We decided to purchase this system and game to be able to still feel like we are working out together. Our favorite coaches are Billy and Zion. We started working out in Jan and are both down totaling 60lbs combined. All the coaches are great, inspiring,  and motivational through the workout. Thanks for putting my sister and I back on track. The 4 stars only is because the game does glitch every now and then."
59,ImJustBaka,Feb 21 at 3:59 PM,5,Awesome for weight loss,I have been using this game for 13 weeks everyday and I have lost crazy amounts of weight( 50 lbs) and have gained alot of muscle.

62,Lianne,7 days ago,4,Not happy...,"I wanted to try our this program so I clicked on the free trial. I would like to recommend a reminder that the trial is over. Did you like the program? Do you want to purchase said program. 

I ended up getting charged for this program, which I wasn't notified that I would be, and it's non-refundable? The same for the meditation  program. I had as a trial and now that has been charged without warning?

I have been searching to find where it is written start date and end of trial. Does that exist?

63,Gege,Jan 13 at 4:08 AM,5,I love it!,"I started working out with FitXR a few months ago and I gotta say, I love it! There are so many different workouts to choose from- dance, boxing, and HIIT. Another thing I love is traveling with it, I travel a lot and I don't even have to worry about going to the gym. I can work out straight from my hotel room. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to experience a fun workout while working on those fitness goals."
64,Porkchop,Feb 11 at 11:13 PM,5,Awesome fitness app,This is such a cool motivating way to get in shape. You can definitely feel the workouts working your body but its so much fun that you don't pay attention to the fact that it's a work out.
65,Yuwen Wang,Jan 21 at 7:09 PM,5,Fun Workout!,"This is one of the best fitness VR apps out there!  I like the boxing studio the most.  The workouts are very empowering and fun and you are definitely going to get sweaty!   I enjoy being in the different environments, especially the roof top gym.  It is also cool that you can see your classmates and how your score is compared to others."
66,Hayden,Jan 6 at 10:03 AM,1,7 day free trial/disappointing,"I received the 7 day free trial and I loved it. I thought I was going to pay $9.99 a month, and it charged me for the full year, and I did not agree to that. I thought it was strange that I was charged $83.99 on my PayPal account. I never agreed to pay the full year. It just charged that on its own. I‚Äôm upset because there wasn‚Äôt an option when I agreed to the 7 day free trail.   It simply said $9.99 a month. I would like a refund."
67,Gingin,Jan 19 at 5:51 PM,5,Marvelously Stumulating,"I cancelled my trial free after 1 day and I am a happy subscriber. The music is fantastic and goes very well with the exercising you are doing.
For beginners like myself I throughly enjoyed having a quick tutorial on the exercises that will be presented. The music is upbeat and  the different Trainers makes this program motivating but doable despite the level of intensity. 
Again I am a beginner and will have to work my way up to the advanced exercises.  In addition the different training styles Ie Boxing etc with trainers and new update have made this program worthwhile. I am rating this a 5++."
68,evilstarbright,Mar 7 at 3:04 PM,5,Best work out!,"Been doing this for a week, an hr a day, I already see results. I would recommend this to everyone"
69,Travis,Jan 19 at 11:05 PM,1,Shady practices and non-refundable trial,"I had tested out the 7 day trial, which they assured me they would notify me before the subscription was renewed.

I was charged 122$ today which was mind blowing with how little this app offers. I reached out to meta support and all I got was a pre-written message on how they do not offer refunds on content. 

They default you to purchase an entire year membership rather than the 11$ per month, it never asked me if I wanted to be billed manually or monthly, it just picked the most expensive option to scam people. 

This seems like such a shady practice, tricking users into buying something extremely expensive and not telling them the price or notifying them before the trial has expired.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS OR USE THE FREE TRIAL!"
70,Shizz,Dec 26 at 5:10 AM,1,Rip Off,"I originally paid for the app in full that had full access. I now have a dead app that I cannot play unless I pay for a subscription when I initially purchased the full app. This is a rip off and disgrace. It is wrong to have your customers to pay for something in full then change it to subscription. If you wanted to change this for people who newly purchase it under a subscription that is fine, but to change a fully purchased app to a subscription for those hwo have already purchased it is just wrong. I would like a refund of my original purchase."
71,Nink,6 days ago,5,Best VR workout!,I bought this program and used it throughout my pregnancy‚Ä¶ the exercises are all so different and challenging! I found the workouts perfect to stay active during my pregnancy‚Ä¶ I plan on using it postpartum as well!
72,Scouserz,8 days ago,3,It's ok,"I have had this app since the first day of Box vr, but unfortunately, I decided to cancel my subscription. I just don't find it that enjoyable anymore and I still think the music isn't that good as I feel a lot more trance music would be better. All the classes should have the option from beginner up to expert not just one specific level. I also find the locations to be boring as they are very rarely updated, and it just feels the same after using the app for such a long time. I have always had an issue with the multiplayer, and it is just so annoying that there is no option to just join a room with other random players. Surely after nearly 2 years the multiplayer and music should be better? If fit xr improve the music and multiplayer I may be tempted to subscribe again but I have requested many times along with alot of other fit xr players to sort out the multiplayer but to no avail."
73,MaD MaX,Feb 7 at 9:41 PM,5,Really good,"A few times the application cut off during trainers. But overall I like FitXRüëçüëçüëç

74,Otherme,11 days ago,1,Does't work offline,"App does not work offline and when you try to start it offline it doesnt tell you that there is a problem, just keeps showing loading screen.

During the workout it randomly freezes/glitches when loading new song/content for 1 second making you miss your shot. Overall it's UI looks plain unpolished and not worth $10 a month.

There are no instructions in box classes, you have to figure out yourself how to hit with upper cut, jabs or hooks. There no review showing if you're doing it right."
75,MarvelFam,Jan 4 at 3:10 AM,5,So fun!!,"I HATE exercising, but I absolutely love this game!! It is so much fun. I‚Äôm very competitive so I like watching the scoreboard to see where I end up compared to other players. It is not too hard and not overly easy either. I like how the classes are 8-15 mins. I can do it before work in the morning. I do the beginner workouts and my back and shoulder muscles were sore the next 2 days. Not too much but where I felt like it was actually working. I have been using this every day now and am feeling so much more confident in myself without having yo actually go to a.gym class."

78,ACE,Jan 13 at 2:11 PM,1,What in the blue Hell,"I paid for a full working game. With hundreds of workouts I could choose from. Now I can't do anything unless I subscribe. I went through all the content and I cannot pick anything because it's all locked. I will not pay 9,99 a month. Because u guys made a promise to help me with my journey that was the reason I bought this game. And now I have to subscribe? That's not fair at all. For people who bought the game before the subscription was introduced it should be free. Because we bought a full working game. And now we can't use it anymore. U Basically took our money to upgrade your game so much u could change it to subscription to make more money. But what about us where is my money when I can not use the game anymore? If I cannot use it anymore I see the money as investment. I want a share on the money u made with it. Without the people who bought the game you could not do anything and that's how you say thank you by making us spending more money on it even when we already bought the game. Thats fraud. Please give us back our game."

I get too competitive trying to get #1 and can‚Äôt fully focus on enjoying the workout. Another nice feature would be to be able to create a workout schedule. Say I wanted to do a few boxing sessions with Billy D, and then a HIIT session with Sarah, and end it off with a dance session with Frida. I could choose which classes I want to do ahead of time, and add them to a schedule for the next day. And finally, more workout/home environments."

With the new workouts, I decided to go ahead and to commit for a year.  Developers, take note here.  Have amp,e funds for that on my account in gift cards, but Meta is not allowing payment for the subscription through that method.  Customer support doesn‚Äôt honor scheduled calls.  The chat folks probably do not know how to use the device and pretty much have been inadequate to get this issue resolved.  So, I will use the Les Mills app which doesn‚Äôt have a subscription.  May want to see if Meta will fix this issue for you since I do not seem to be of value to them.  Sorry that I won‚Äôt be able to subscribe."

This was my favorite workout game, but the male trainers calling me cutie over and over became sickening. I‚Äôm sure I am not the only one that feels like this is too much.

I feel more energetic and powerful.

4 stars only, because somehow the cross and jab hits recorded as ‚Äúweak‚Äù hits even if normally it would break some bricks and bones."

Ôøº I honestly see this as the game that should‚Äôve been a one time purchase and not the subscription model. It just doesn‚Äôt hold up to what you‚Äôd expect if you‚Äôre paying a subscription. Ôøº the trainers will tell you wow I‚Äôve never seen anyone do better when you‚Äôve missed every combo they need a better algorithm, ÔøºÔøºbut I did lose 40 pounds over the past six months using it.

116,Sascha Sebastian,25 days ago,3,It‚Äôs getting better. It‚Äôs not Les Mills,"Well ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs gotten a lot better since the last time I used it. But I don‚Äôt know if it isn‚Äôt a little cluttered now. There‚Äôs just too much stuff and nothing is really done well.

I mostly tried the Boxing and Combat lessons since I don‚Äôt really care about the other stuff. Adding a warmup and cool-down is a nice idea but having to do them with super creepy cgi avatars instead of the real people is a super strange choice. 

Boxing is as basic as it gets but the feedback is fun and hitting stuff is satisfying. Until you compare it to Les Mills you‚Äôd think it‚Äôs pretty well done. But ever do play the competition, you realise that it‚Äôs more of a rhythm game than a workout. With Les Mills every exercise is designed to target different muscle groups effectively or focus on power, speed or plain cardio. Here it can feel pretty repetitive just hitting stuff to the beat. Also the trainers are pretty useless. Throwing platitudes at you instead of - like Les Mills does ist - explaining to you how to do the moves most effectively and why they have to be done this way. 

The combat discipline seemed cool at first, implementing Karate moves. But those are explained to you in a three minute video beforehand and you have to somehow memorise 6 or 8 moves in two stances and can‚Äôt watch that video again or have it explained to you while actually doing it (again: something Les mills does really well).

So all in all: for the variety it‚Äôs nice. It is a cheaper alternative to the probably superior Supernatural. But when it comes to the actual gameplay and the workout factor for cardio boxing, it‚Äôs nowhere near as refined or motivating as Les Mills Body Combat. 

As an Experience it‚Äòd be 4 Stars. But a subscription model is an automatic -1 unless I can see how it is really necessary. Here it isn‚Äôt, since new courses could just as easily be sold in packs, giving people the chance to actually pick what they like."
117,Becky,Jan 29 at 6:57 PM,1,Couldn‚Äôt Cancel,"Trial subscription is misleading to where you can‚Äôt cancel . I had the trial with an option to subscribe. I tried to cancel while in the app in my oculus. It tells you to do it in the oculus app. Funny, it‚Äôs not clear there either. Now I‚Äôm being charged for a whole year that I don‚Äôt want. Way to lure people in."
118,Powerpixel,Mar 12 at 1:56 PM,1,Can not get subscription..,"I love the workouts, was going to try the trial week to see if I‚Äôd be interested in the full subscription but unfortunately it won‚Äôt work.

119,AlyssaMarie,Dec 18 at 12:12 AM,5,Great workouts!,I started using this app about two weeks ago and I already feel stronger! I used to hate going to the gym doing cardio and weights.

Price is good for the workouts you get! Highly recommendü§©

I prefer another App with a one time bill instead of a subscription."
124,Mirage,Mar 9 at 2:35 AM,1,Paid but it does not work,Sometimes when I would go in the app would make things far away so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to play.  I would have to reset.  Now when I go in I can‚Äôt play because it does not register my controllers but my controllers work with every other game.  Then I tried to fix it anyway just in case and even did a factory reset and it still doesn‚Äôt work so I‚Äôm out a month because it won‚Äôt let me ask for a refund.  Lame

132,MightyAboba,Mar 3 at 12:52 PM,4,Great app for fitness,"Cool workouts, nice instructors, variety of sessions, almost every music is perfec, also it's very appreciated that it's possible to select music genre for training. Looks like this app have no drawbacks but it has one and it's serious: the height detection is very unstable. This parameter resets everytime when I start any session after the first one. It's strange and it's annoying. Aslo, I don't know but looks like targets have low position even if my height set properly. It'll be perfect if you fix it somehow. This is the only one obstacle that prevents me to give it 5 stars"

I did. Then it told me to SUBCRIBE to the game, even though a had already played. Now I just have an app that I don‚Äôt play anymore. I NEED MY MONEY BACK"

I enjoyed the box vr game a lot, looked forward to do this in the morning but now i can not get myself to go and do it. Why? Why could you not give us the option to stay with the old game? It was 5 stars now i give it a 1... i m sad...

UPDATE
They gave me back the old version, for awhile it was ok but because no updaters it became unplayable.
So i gave the new version a try‚Ä¶I absolutely hate it. The trainers are awful, everything about it is ü§Æ

Luckily i found a new boxing trainer app what is absolutely great, it reminds me of the original game. Trainers are good not grinch like those in fitxr"
137,DildoSlaggins,Nov 20 at 2:58 PM,1,DISGRACE : ripped off by developer,"UPDATED REVIEW : 1/5
I paid for a complete app when this launched. I have likely helped fund the ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù to the app, and now my initial, complete, full access game is a subscription based app that scrapped the feature I initially loved.

This is messed up from the developers. Terrible behavior. Going to see about a refund. I won‚Äôt support this behavior and now I basically have a dead app I paid for, part funded through that initial payment.


PAST REVIEW : 3/5
While the new in game UI is slicker, I have some gripes that has made the experience less enjoyable:
1 - my playlists have been deleted!!
2 - forced account creation? Really?
3 - I want to turn the trainers off
4 - I was unable to skip the tutorial flow

Not sure how the above seemed like good ideas, but please bring back the custom playlist. Some of the music is not to my tastes at all which is why I built those. 

This is a step forward on the art side, but a step back in quality of life features.


ORIGINAL REVIEW : 4/5
I found it good for a week or so, but want something more intense.

And good cardio but not for boxers who care about developing technique. Which is fine. This might be the Tai Bo equivalent of boxing fitness apps.

Hard mode is not hard enough. If they can add an expert mode, it would be appreciated. Once you can handle hard levels, it loses its fun.

Would be great if you had more thrash metal tracks too. That aspirational advert-style indie rock gets tedious after a while.

Using your own music would be perfect, but I know that‚Äôs a challenge to implement without access to stems so the experience is optimized.

Hoping this gets updated with some new backgrounds too.

Solid work otherwise."

My weight increases due to lack of proper exercise until I downloaded this game. 

Just by playing beginner boxing (warm up and cool down) I became more alert and getting firmer arms. Weight reduced within a week. I see massive improvement in my health and strength much more than my physical hike session.

It is awesome, the positive vibes and images reminds me of the time when I was working in London. Making international friends and enjoying gym session during lunch.

Only for memebrs, but...it's cool!
I tried dance workouts that I always avoid!
Cool!

FitXR is a fitness application focused on boxing movements: straight, hook, uppercut, dodge and ... lots of squats.
Everything shines for precision and coordination with the music: the music is specially designed for workouts that are divided into 3 degrees of difficulty. There is an accurate counting of calories and the possibility of confronting other players, both on a delayed basis and in a real multiplayer. 

A few months ago FitXR decided to introduce a monthly subscription of 10 euros: the reviewngs!
 bombing was unleashed ... 
But now they have understood the lesson and ... 

FitXR is back to being what it was before, even better!

The app makes your heart rate go up quickly and thanks to the proven and compound movements of boxing it offers a real workout! A rich repertoire of exercises is offered to all; plus a new one comes out every month, which will remain forever in your library. 

Well done, FitXR!"

There are so many other options out there for them that are non subscription based and they're now going that route which makes it a shame that I'll rarely be on thisü§∑ 

You should at least offer a limited ""pay once"" option for people who don't want to pay monthly but want to join friends and family that purchased the thing before you went subscription based. It's kinda separated everyone now?"

171,Matt,Feb 21 at 6:51 PM,1,I‚Äôve had this for a few weeks now‚Ä¶meh,"Generally speaking, it‚Äôs good. The trainers are engaging and I feel like I leave with a great workout. 

HOWEVER, some of the exercises like in the Sculpt category mention being able to use wrist weight/weighted gloves. That‚Äôs really not the case. The movements in some workouts are too rapid and if you do up to speed, you‚Äôll easily get injured. And if you slow down you get demotivated cuz the app just yells at you for slowing down. 

Also, the new combat classes are cool, but they don‚Äôt register high blocks very well. That‚Äôs probably because Quest 2 controllers are buggy af in general but they should be aware of that and allow some leeway to compensate for where the hardware is at right now cuz it really doesn‚Äôt track well depending on how well it calibrates when you turn on the headset. 

There are small annoying things like trainers saying what‚Äôs next after the next set of moves already started, but I think the third big killer is that HIIT stuff doesn‚Äôt render well. For me it‚Äôs far too spaced out so I‚Äôm taking many steps over just to be able to reach, and you really don‚Äôt wanna do more than just lunge when you‚Äôre essentially wearing a blindfold. 

So yeah, great app, but needlessly dangerous. It‚Äôs like the people who developed it only tested it out on a space they designed for testing and not in like a normal bedroom or living room in a house or an apartment.

UPDATE: Still buggy and now gives headaches on loading screen and the main menu. You guys have used a headset before, right? Tip: Huge swaths of bright colors reflect off the lenses making it difficult to see. Adjust the colors!"
172,Nick Valois,Nov 28 at 11:51 PM,5,Best Workout App,I love the boxing!

What it makes less enjoyable for me is the framerate and graphics. If I look to the competitors like Les Mills or Supernatural, the targets are flying super smooth towards me.

Graphics are ok, nothing flashy but they get the job done. New workouts are added all the time and are in beginner, intermediate and hard levels which is great. Music that you workout to is mostly good. You won‚Äôt be recognising much, but some of the tracks are cool. Think of it as discovering new music. 

Hit/power mechanism for the boxing is great and the hiit classes allow for a great lower body workout too. The addition of ducks and slips in the boxing classes can make it feel like a good boxing combo sometimes. 

Overall an easy recommendation worth the cost. You will get fit if you put in the work with this app."
183,Scott Bailey,15 days ago,1,It not what it look like,It not free for the class so if your looking for free games than don't get this
184,Reid,20 days ago,1,Not actually free,Got so excited till I learned you have to pay a trial
185,C-shele,Jan 4 at 5:50 AM,1,Won‚Äôt Honor Full Version Purchases,I bought this originally as a full version and now they won‚Äôt honor it and now require a subscription. I‚Äôve paid for the app and now they want me to pay more to use it at all. Not ok. I definitely won‚Äôt be recommending this app to anyone.
186,Axden,Jan 29 at 7:20 AM,3,must have patience and time to waste,good content but extremely long load times especially when the developer pushes new content in the app. As a working adult with a family I cant sit around 20mins waiting for the app to load. worst if due to intermittent connections the app closes and the processes restarts‚Ä¶
187,Chris,Oct 12 at 12:02 AM,5,Great app...please remove song ‚ÄúTake It‚Äù,"Love the workouts this app provides.  Makes working out fun!! Only problem I have is with the song ‚ÄúTake It‚Äù by The Siege. Vocalist in song sings about raping a woman if she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúgive it up‚Äù.  Disappointing to hear this in an otherwise quality product.  Would be 5 stars without this song.

Update: they got back to me and addressed this VERY quickly. It is nice to see such prompt customer service!  Upgraded rating to 5 stars!!"

189,Ellie,Jan 9 at 1:15 PM,2,Subscription,"Says here it‚Äôs 7.99 month but once trail started it said ¬£65 will be taken and doesn‚Äôt seem to give monthly option so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be carrying on after the trail, shame as I would have enjoyed this game but not willing to taken in for a year and it‚Äôs to overpriced for a month or 2"
190,EnvyRenae,Jan 9 at 11:27 PM,1,Terrible,"Coming from the supernatural trial over to this one to see which app was better before I decided to pay the subscription. Today my trail ended with supernatural and I download this app. With in the first 10 mins of being in this app, I quickly realized supernatural is 100% better. They use real humans in vr and not animated ones. To be completely honest the animated ones wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if I didnt feel like I was being rushed to see the movements they are about do within 5 second so I just end up looking a feeling like a complete goof ball trying to workout if that makes any sense. On top of that I am working out with other people so I dont feel like my workout is solely based on me. My opinion slow down the movements so I can know and get the feel of what I‚Äôm about to be doing other wise I just feel rushed. I would give 0 stars if I could. Going back to supernatural thanks."
191,GRAND WIZARD,Feb 24 at 1:46 PM,1,No refunds?,I subscribed last year and used the app a few times then unsubscribed due to not using the app and now 10 months later they're saying I never canceled the subscription and I can't get my refund.

195,Bertram,Nov 10 at 8:19 PM,5,Love it!,"I love this game. The boxing And HIIT are great. Try to move everyday with this program. The only thing is that I‚Äôm pregnant and it would be nice to have a selection for pregnant women. Sometimes all the defense movements are too much with boxing (abdominal pain).

But above all‚Ä¶ LOVE IT! Also my husband uses this program."
196,TheUnseen,Jan 14 at 11:03 PM,1,Scam,"I bought it before it became subscription based, they changed to a monthly subription model afterwards and now even my vasic courses are no longer available. It was great back in the days but no-one should support this shady behaviour."

199,Diane,Jan 14 at 4:57 PM,1,Didn‚Äôt care for,"Even though it  has many options I am 58 year old beginner and there really wasn‚Äôt much instruction on how to do things, like the beginning boxer.  If I a beginner some slight instruction on how to punch and things would have been nice.  The warm ups are ok though.  Maybe more for the younger generation, at least in my opinion.  Deleted from oculus so hopefully it cancelled my trial. Will
See!"
200,sevensides,Jan 17 at 1:38 PM,2,Getting Worse,"This was fantastic when I got it a few years ago but they insist on titivating the game constantly. There's no real improvements just regular meaningless update.  For the last few months more often than not the targets are too low, unless you're 4 feet tall, which I'm not. It's so bad I ended up buying the Les Mills Game. 

I realise they have to give there devs something to do but have them write a new game."
201,Teenyweeny,Jan 11 at 11:18 AM,4,Good fun,"I hate exercise but this does make it fun, love the multiplayer option so me and my sister can workout  together even though we are miles away. 
There are loads of classes to choose from but we would love a yoga or Pilates class to compliment the fast paced ones."
202,Rolf Johnsen,Dec 3 at 3:43 AM,5,Great workout!,"Im new to vr, and use to do my exercise at a gym. After i got this game i dont use the gym that much! Amazing way to get your heart beating! If you got vr and want to use it for exercise,then this game is a must have!"

204,Shay Cohen,Oct 10 at 11:40 PM,1,The free version gives nothing!,"The free version doesn't give you anything just a very short guide designed to get you to send your email address to the developer.
They ask you for a mail And only after you sent your address  you realize that you have to pay to continue.
For me, it's a kind of fraud to take an email like that!
Due diligence should be done at the beginning and not after someone gives their details!
I have no problem paying for apps and software, but as soon as you do something like this, I know there will be more surprises like this in the future! 
I deleted the app."
205,Beth Boggs,Jan 8 at 6:57 PM,4,Use daily - boxing is my favorite,"I use this daily and greatly enjoy it. The only improvements I can suggest are as follows:

Hand controls option instead of always having to use controllers - This would cause me to increase my rating to 5 stars!

Kickboxing to add more leg work

Ability to incorporate home equipment (i.e. I have a freestanding heavy bag but get bored using it)"
206,Agata Inventio,Nov 16 at 5:45 PM,5,Great workout and amazing fun!,"I use the app for over a year now and it never gets boring, for me it‚Äôs a life changer bc I get bored of exercising quickly. Daily updates make it fresh and novel. FitXR keeps me entertained and I am in great a shape now. 100% recommended it."
207,Rose,Jan 26 at 6:28 PM,2,Fun but has problems,I decided to try this game since it was a little cheaper then other ones I've used and at first I liked it even tho you could tell the quality was lower. But playing it more and being competitive I don't like how it can't tell when you actually hit the objects you're supposed to be hitting! The boxing one doesn't count them all even if you know you hit them! Even intermediate is slow and easy compared to hard on supernatural where I could almost get a 100% on a song. Also don't like how it doesn't tell you what songs you're going to be listening to. And the songs aren't the best.  Very bummed I missed the cancellation of the 7 day free trial and now stuck with this for a year!
208,SanFee,Feb 2 at 1:49 AM,1,InApp Subscription after buying the app,"I was really turned off when being asked to pay an additional monthly subscription fee after paying for the app. Not on par with Lesmill boxing app, which you only pay for the app once and you get updated content regularly."
209,Krazekitty,Nov 26 at 6:01 PM,1,Can‚Äôt subscribe!,So after my free trial I went on to purchase the subscription. Has taken the money from my account but when I go onto the game it‚Äôs still the demo version!!! Not happy at all. Still telling me to sign up for subscription AFTER I already have done!!! This sucks

215,Lisa Raggiri,Oct 21 at 5:33 AM,5,"Amazing. Fun, Powerful, Great Workout",THIS REALLY WORKS. I started using this App to get a great workout after work at home to destress and work up a sweat. I tried HIIT first and it was a great workout and SUPER FUN. The 30 minutes flew by and I felt like I worked up a great sweat. I explored Dance and LOVED it. Dance was such a great surprise. Its a great mix of cardio and dance moves. It was easy to follow but challenging without feeling awkward. Both made me FEEL STRONG. Box is a BOXX STUDIO. I do it now as my ultra cardio routine. The more I explore the more collections and music I find. Feels like a new and fun experience every time.  LOVING THIS APP 4x a week now. Worth it!!!!
216,zackary,Nov 18 at 9:29 AM,5,awesome fitness app,i love this app. downloaded to help loose weight and it‚Äôs working and feel so much better about my body. the trainers also help motivate you and the app actually helps you get your entire body moving unlike other apps
217,Harley,Jan 4 at 11:42 PM,2,Frustrating scoring method and streaks,"I downloaded the free trial, tried a couple of each kind of class, and realized I was terrible at the game because my score streaks were pitiful. I ended up deleting it and feeling bad about myself. Determined to myself wrong I came back the next day and downloaded it again and even on the easiest, most boring level I couldn't score higher than a 5 in boxing. Angry I decided to give it a google and found SO MANY threads of oculus users having the same problem. I'd consider paying monthly for this game if it didn't require me to punch so hard I dislocate my shoulder and break the sound barrier in order to get points. Same goes for the sculpting classes, it seems like if my arms aren't EXACTLY where the game wants them, in some mysterious place not specified, i lose my measly streak. It's so frustrating it's truly not fun. I only gave it 2 stars because I did enjoy 1 workout enough to finish it despite it telling me I did the whole thing wrong."
218,Penny,Jan 10 at 6:17 PM,1,Paid for and now can't use,Purchased when i got my Vr. Paid full price no subscription required. Now it's requiring a subscription.   Not fair.  I shouldn't have to change to subscription to use something i already paid for this is a rip off.  I would like my app or my money back.
219,SnaggleDick,Jan 28 at 3:54 AM,2,Not for everyone,"The thing that ruined this for me was the coaching. I don‚Äôt want to have someone talking to me constant during my workout, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be an option to turn them off. I was excited to play this as it looked like a boxing version of beat saber, but the coaching turned me off of the app. Accidentally paid 10$ too as i forgot to cancel the trial. 

All in all a great concept and im sure others have a lot of fun. If they add an option (noticeable) to disable the coaches voices I will come back and re review."
220,Tootie21,Jan 15 at 6:36 AM,1,Not working,"I paid for this app and now I can‚Äôt use it!! It says I need a subscription. I already paid for the app. No where did it say that it would change. I used to play all the time, because I BOUGHT the game. Now I can‚Äôt use it??"

226,Joseff,Jan 29 at 9:06 PM,2,Fun until the tutorial is done,"When I finished doing the tutorial I had to pick a trial. Although they say it it's a free trial it asks you to pay for the trial

227,Nellie,Jan 25 at 6:28 AM,3,No long dance sessions,"I‚Äôm not into boxing. I prefer to dance for excercise. I searched for long dance classes/sessions and there are none. The short ones are fine but they are only 10 minutes long. This would be a great work out for those who like to box, sadly it isn‚Äôt me."
228,Errold,Oct 14 at 7:58 AM,5,What a major upgrade!,"Edit: Playing this game again after 2 years and it feels like a completely different experience. The DNA is still there but wow the environments, the workout, music and instructors all have been upgraded. Feels like a premium experience and a steal considering I've paid about the same to attend just one HIIT class in real life. Got me sweating a lot but the gamification of the excercises and the gameplay is so satisfying. 

This upgrade to BoxVR is amazing. I'm a web designer/developer, music enthusiast and fitness hobbyist and this feels like it's right at home! BoxVR felt cartoony for me and I wasn't a fan of some of the design choices and colors scheme (nitpicky I know). Something about it didn't click with me like the other games do maybe because it lacked in the visual department. The tracks were always great and I was honestly surprised by how much I liked it. It definitely has the strongest track list by far and it still maintains that. This upgrade brings significantly cleaner/modern UI and also creates a class-like atmosphere which is something I sorely missed from pre-covid days. I think the team did an awesome job freshening up the game and making it feel. Aside from the load times, it was such a great surprise to come back to this after a small break from VR.

P.S. I am much more of a casual compared to other people in the reviews that seem passionate about some of the changes so my review and experience isn't as extensive as theirs"

The price is even better.
232,RDC,Dec 2 at 7:59 AM,5,Best VR Workout!,"Cant say much about dancing part of the game, but boxing part is the best vr workout you will ever get!"
233,iFriSki,Jan 12 at 10:44 PM,3,Has great potential,"Going to start out mentioning I'm going to compare this to Supernatural, as that's what I was using before purchasing FitXR for the year. I utilize this for cardio alongside my weight lifting routine. 

I only utilize Boxing/HIIT modes. I have not tried the Sculpt or Dancing modes.

The girlfriend and I play religiously for cardio even though we're hours apart at work. The multiplayer function sold it for us. 

The workouts are far more intense than those found in Supernatural. I played on high intensity on Supernatural and they're comparable to the intermediate levels found in FitXR. I haven't played the elite(?) levels yet as I haven't quite defeated the intermediate levels. They defeat me. 

A lack of height adjustment makes HIIT incredibly unreliable compared to Supernaturals method. I'm 173""(6'1"") and I struggle to get the hit boxes to reliably appear, despite fully standing. It is very reliable going into squat, but it doesn't consistently sense I'm standing. It'd be nice if I could set my squat depth as I could go deeper as well. It tends to activate the lower hit boxes before I even near parallel, which is why I believe it struggles when I stand. 

The trainers are wicked annoying in FitXR and lack even the most basic of AI regarding their training. You can do absolutely nothing and they'll complement you on your great work. They're essentially a prerecorded audio clip and go off randomly. 

The music doesn't have any correlation to the game modes. There is no rhyme or reason, which is something Supernatural did very well. 

They've made tremendous updates since I've started using it and I will continue to use it. It'd be nice to have a friends list or a community leaderboard as well. The friends list could simply allow joining a friends game easier. I'm competitive, and I'm sure others are as well. When you play a random map the leaderboard fills up and it keeps it motivating. 

Will update my review as time goes on. So far, I'm pleased."
234,Angrod,Jan 13 at 2:15 AM,2,Good App but Issues,"Each time the App get's an Update, there are technical issues later. After an Update,
 I started to Workout, and the ground began to lift 20 to 40 cm. The problem started 3 or 4 Updates ago. After each Update, it's there again and will be gone in a few days. This sucks because I pay for it and don't want to stop my Workout. I love the App but with this Issues it's not worth it."

243,Aryus,Oct 11 at 6:18 AM,5,Amazing workout game!,I honestly was a bit skeptical by the whole concept of workouts in VR and not to mention the prices of a membership that are basically the same price as me just buying a gym membership but this game turned out to be insanely fun and great for cardio workouts. I‚Äôve become a big fan of the workouts and honestly the price isn‚Äôt bad if you do the yearly 30% discount annual rate.
244,Roxy,Sep 26 at 1:20 AM,5,Great workout routines!!!,"I usually struggle with working out consistently but this app makes it so much fun that you forget you are even working out!

248,StevenDee,Oct 2 at 4:57 PM,5,"A great workout, fun and exhausting","I use this for boxing and HIIT. It is so much fun to use, I look forward to it every day. It's starting to really have an impact on how I look and feel. I think that for something that I use every day, $9.99 a month is not expensive. It has changed a lot winds the earlier reviews, so look at the latest reviews. Also, there are a whole bunch of customers who would prefer to buy the workouts individually rather than pay for subscription, which is how it was offered in the past, and they've given this some low ratings. It's not offered that way anymore, and that makes these customers mad. So the low rated reviews are based on the pricing plan, not the quality of the app. If you are OK with the price, this is really good."

But I want something that I can buy just one time. Not a game for $19.99 every month like supernatural. I love FitXR. I have lost obe 25lbs before this game. I was doing Billy Blanks Taebo. I love boxing and the different variety of much on FitXR. I would like more variety of music like upbeat gospel music. I love you guys prices, it's so awesome. I have recommended some of my family to you guys. I have a hard time getting off the workouts, thats how fun it is.. thank you guys so much. I'm glad you guys fix the clinches of when you pause tge game it keep playing. Now last week, a figure of one of the players when I was doing the group workout. Look like it walked out and looked up.. scared the mess out of me now I just do the solo workouts because I don't like seeing the other avatar members.. lol but other than that great game.. you guys should do an update on the hand control. Instead of using the controls we should free hand, where you really can punch and maybe use your own wrist weights to feel a complete workout and tone more."

263,Nick,Jan 11 at 10:41 AM,1,Free Trial,"I didn't agree to purchase this game but after 3 days I saw that money had been taken out of my PayPal account.
Money taken out was for a whole year's subscription.
Can I get my money back please?"
264,Alice,Oct 20 at 6:39 AM,1,Pay attention,"Maybe it was my fault for not noticing ""subscription required"" under the details, but I don't appreciate the game asking for my info (especially my email) before telling me that there's a subscription to actually play the game. Sure there's a seven day free trial, but I don't want to risk it in case it's a pain in the butt to cancel."
265,MaDoO,Jan 30 at 9:16 PM,1,Too expensive.,Too expensive subscriptions.
266,JJ,Jan 4 at 2:28 PM,1,Refund,"I did not want this... I have not played this.. Please could I have a refund. Only just bought this for my son an trying to set it up for him so I don't know how this happened.please could you refund this, I really can't afford 63.99"
267,Ethan Zaferis,Jan 8 at 4:02 AM,1,Can‚Äôt play,Can‚Äôt play always unavailable won‚Äôt let me cancel the free trial now it charged me full year and it still won‚Äôt refund me . Don‚Äôt get this game so far no help from support or this game .
268,Hannah,Jan 23 at 8:44 PM,2,,The workouts are fun I enjoy then but I shouldn't need to get out of my border to be able to hit targets that doesn't make sense.
269,Sandra,9 days ago,4,Newbie for this game,"I like it BUT,  for beginner boxing and combat. Is there a way to slow down the quickness of things coming at you? Cuz wow! Beginner settings seems to be more like  intermediate.  For dancing and sculpting as well. Just one persons thought though."
270,Simonp,Jan 15 at 10:20 AM,1,Billing??????,I have done the free 7 day trial that I like. So happy to pay ¬£7.99 a month to use. But I got a bill through after 7 days asking for ¬£83.99????
271,Jane K,Sep 13 at 11:18 PM,5,Great for weight loss,"I get that former boxvr users are angry about how the transition to fitxr happened, but I'm a new user and I'm very happy. There are some hickups here and there and maybe I would have given it 4 stars, if fitxr didn't have such a low rating. But anything below 4.0 is just simply unfair for this wonderful app and all the work the team puts into this.

I started only with boxing in the beginning of this year, but soon also enjoyed the HIIT exercises. But dancing has probably had the best development. I really have fun with it now.

I've started losing weight and fitxr is helping me a great deal. It's fun to exercise and I can do it anytime from home. 

Thanks fitxr and keep up the great worküëç"
272,Sayu,Nov 20 at 4:56 PM,1,Terrible internet connection,"I really like the workout, however I don‚Äôt know what kind of internet this app requires, it keeps giving me no internet error while I‚Äôm connecting to 5ghz Wi-Fi and my other apps have no problem. I‚Äôm not even able to launch this app after trying to reset my headset and reinstalling this app, very disappointed."
273,WazzupChatBan,Jan 6 at 5:29 AM,1,Trash game,Dont give it free to download when you can only play the tutorial go make it paid instead this is really bad for people who are New with the quest 2 and want free games not to pay for a sub
274,BullHalsey,Sep 6 at 4:47 AM,5,Great program!,"You get a taste for free to show what they have to offer. With the paid subscription you get access to all workouts and they add more all the time. 
Large variety of options, music and instructors. I sweat so much it has to be helping. 
I definitely recommend to anyone who wants a great at home workouts."
275,RafaelNGP,Jan 16 at 6:05 PM,3,Please add hand tracking,I'm unable to use my subscription since my left controller broke. If FitXR had hand tracking I could continue using it without the controllers.
276,Jeff,Nov 28 at 6:15 AM,1,Subscription model - yuck,Give me an app I can pay for once with maybe some downloadable content that I might want to pay extra for. Not going to pay monthly though.
277,SamsungXDGGhola,Nov 8 at 3:26 AM,5,End subscription,Hi! I love this app but I want to end the subscription for a while. How can I do it?
278,Mlaff,Dec 30 at 4:43 PM,1,Can‚Äôt start free trial,"I‚Äôve tried 5 different times to start the free trial. Never works. After confirming the transaction from my meta App, the app tells me to return to the VR headset where nothing happens. I have restarted the headset, the game and the phone app multiple times. 

However the subscription does appear to have been registered and will cost money after seven days. There is no way for me to play the game or cancel the subscription. Was excited to use this, but it‚Äôs unfortunately super buggy üëéüèΩ"
279,Ang,Dec 15 at 4:25 AM,2,It‚Äôs soo glitchy,I love this app and experience. It is a shame that it crashes every time I use it. I also had considered (before the crashes) subscribing to get the full content but I am somehow locked into a 7-day trial since May of 2021 and can‚Äôt seem to find a way to subscribe. I would gladly stick with getting everything free but I would like to try some longer workouts and I don‚Äôt see those included in the free version.

281,Jaganath,Dec 9 at 9:47 PM,4,Great workouts-Sarah Burke is EVERYTHING,"I train with this app every other day and there is really good variety of workout types, durations and intensities. Sarah Burke is brilliant, motivating, funny and gorgeous *swoon* :)  The only things that would improve FitXR for me would be the ability to use it offline so you could train outside away from wifi in the summer and more/better rock tracks to train to, eg. Slash & Myles Kennedy, GN'R, Foo fighers, Queen etc. (or purchase packs like you can with beatsaber)."
282,Debster,Jan 10 at 4:29 AM,1,Bought i a while ago,"I bought this a long while ago ( also stands bought in my app) but only can use the free stuff.

Thats not fair"

Thank you

284,Gothix,Mar 18 at 4:40 AM,1,Diversity hire instructors,"I signed up for a free trial and a cancelled the subscription the same day. This game prioritizes diversity and inclusion over having a GOOD  product. For the record, I use les mills daily and not only are those instructors depicted as real humans (this game Ôøºmakes the instructors into cartoons which defeats the purpose of using their photos) but in les mills they also give you feedback and instruction to improve your form for each type of move. In this game , all I heard was superficial affirmations like ‚ÄúJUST BE CONFIDENT!‚Äù‚Ä¶like what?? Can you give me some tips??? But I guess that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd expect from choosing a workout with an instructor that‚Äôs clearly obese. I don‚Äôt say that to be mean, but I just don‚Äôt understand the logic if this game is serious about helping people get fit. Don‚Äôt even get me started on their ‚Äúblack history month‚Äù playlist LOL with white cartoon instructors hahhaa  (I‚Äôm black by the way) if anyone is concerned about the lack of diversity in a fitness game, then they‚Äôre not serious about getting healthy. Truly, the color, gender or sexuality of the instructors should be the last thing on someone‚Äôs mind and I think the game developers know that but are too busy trying to capitalize on diversity and inclusion instead of using their resources to develop a game that actually helps the player. Obviously getting up off the couch is still a step in the right direction, but patting me on the back with affirmations isn‚Äôt the same as letting me know if I should lower my chin, fix my posture, widen my stance, etc.."

297,MPRachel,Jul 19 at 10:06 PM,5,This app should be revisited!,"I tried this app about a year ago and wasn't particularly impressed. I was swept away by the costly supernatural. For many months, I had been paying for the supernatural, but I found myself using it less and less after the spectacle of it all. As a result, I decided to give FitXR another shot. I'd seen a lot of updates over the year, and I liked that you could now use your MetaQuest Avatar, and I figured spending $10 a month to try it again wouldn't break the bank. This time, I was completely blown away. This time, the graphics, environments, multiplayer aspects, music, and workouts all blew me away. I believe this app is now better than Supernatural, or at the very least giving them a run for their money. The 3.2 rating shouldn't be there at all, because you can tell the developers put a lot into this app and continue. I'm thinking about getting a yearly plan for less than $90, which I can afford and won't be too hard on myself if I don't use all the time. I just want it to be there when I need it because it's a really cool app. Hats off to the developers; this is a truly fantastic app that you should revisit or consider if you haven't already. Excellent work!"
298,Ryan,Aug 24 at 2:57 AM,5,Don‚Äôt let the 3.2 stars fool you.,"Got an Oculus for Fathers Day and was wondering what I would use it for because I am not really a gamer. Found some fun family things, and then I started looking for a workout option. FitXR is perfect for a great Mancave workout. It seems the low rating were early on because everything I have experienced has been 5 star. I am sweating at the end of a HIIT and Boxing workout and some of the longer workouts offer a good challenge when trying to climb the leaderboard. New classes being offered weekly keeps it fresh, too, which keeps me coming back. Also, I like that you are held accountable in your workouts and not able to slack on your moves when you might be struggling. Would definitely recommend and would definitely recommend trying again if it has been some time since your last experience."
299,Carsue,Dec 13 at 2:37 AM,4,Cancelling,I want to cancel and cannot figure out where I need to go to do that. Headset said to go to app but there is no ‚Äúcancel here button‚Äù I have just had surgery and it will be a while before I can work out. Thank you for your help.
300,Scott1975,Dec 30 at 11:58 PM,1,Disappointed,Approx 1.5gb  for basically a demo yearly subscription approximately ¬£65 or ¬£7.99 per month j personally think its another way of getting more money out of people
301,Heidi,Sep 7 at 3:07 PM,5,Keep coming back,I'm not one for sticking with a program but this app keeps me coming back for more.  I love that you could have a beginner class or intermediate class or expert if that's where you're at. I also love that you could choose a short class a Long class or a regular class.  I have to give a shout out to trainer Billy Davis as he is the most motivating trainer on this program.
302,JacksonFamily14706,Dec 29 at 2:31 AM,1,Scam!!!,"Don't pay for this app. Once you pay, you'll be required to pay an additional fee for a monthly subscription in order to workout. Complete scam IMO."

306,Spencer Simpkins,Aug 23 at 1:21 PM,5,DRENCHED,"I've been pretty active for a while now. Before using this app for cardio I either hit the elliptical, Bike Machine or Rowing machine. After going through a phase of overeating and depression, I saw all the weight pile on me faster than I realized. I'm still ashamed to go to the gym after how far I've let myself go. This app helped me get back into why I love fitness. I mainly do boxing and love the different lengths and difficulties. After finishing each workout I'm drenched in sweat and need to take a shower immediately. I used it for months before buying a subscription, so try it out for yourself."
307,RayFlatFox,Jan 1 at 6:15 PM,1,How do I cancel,"WTF

312,Always a Rebel,Aug 26 at 9:07 PM,5,Worth the money,"I use FitXR almost every day. I‚Äôve never tried Supernatural since it‚Äôs so expensive so I can‚Äôt compare the two. What I can say undoubtedly, in my opinion, is that the trainers are great. Sarah Burke and Adam Rosante (probably spelled that wrong) are my favorites and their high energy and encouragement keep me coming back day after day. Sarah‚Äôs quirky jokes make me laugh and I absolutely love them. The graphics are fine for my standards and I‚Äôve never experienced any significant lag time or unresponsiveness. I‚Äôve been using it for about a month and paid the year up front since it‚Äôs such a cost savings. I‚Äôm no where near bored with it yet, there are so many classes and enough variety to keep me going. It‚Äôs a great workout if you do the work. A little bit of a learning curve required but really not that different from other apps you might be used to.
Shout out to FitXR and the female trainers who put together the multi trainer boxing class for Women‚Äôs Day. It‚Äôs my new favorite and I love having Sarah in the class since she doesn‚Äôt normally do boxing classes.  Please don‚Äôt take that class off of the list.
For users, if you already have FitXR or decide to take the leap and install it; just remember the trainers will always be there for you - but first you have to put the headset on and show up. Pick your poison and enjoy the ride!"
313,Alin Danulescu,Aug 31 at 12:54 PM,1,Not what I payed for,"I payed for BoxVR, a standalone good application with no account or subscription needed. That was taken away from me, replaced with the curent version which is decent enough but now they want subscription, account etc. I don't need anymore. Too bad for me that I got mugged I guess.

319,Galileo36590,Dec 20 at 2:34 PM,1,Nothing To Play,Buying the app gets you nothing without the subscription. There are other apps that offer good workouts without charging every month for perpetuity.
320,Aaron,Nov 18 at 9:49 PM,3,Pretty decent,The badge/achievement system is trash and it just keeps giving me the same ones over and over. Graphics and animations are mediocre. I honestly recommend Supernatural for a better experience and better music collection for the workout sessions. The best thing about this program is the HIIT sessions. Boxing is pretty good. Not much else that I would recommend about this app/program until it gets better.
321,Jake,25 days ago,1,Junk,"Literally can't even get the app to run. Kept telling me I didn't have an internet connection, then kept stalling on 100% on the introduction work out. Back to supernatural I go"

323,RageZi,Sep 8 at 9:41 PM,5,Just won't load EDIT: Fixed!,"I have been loving this app but I think I'll be cancelling my subscription. There have been too many times when I've gotten ready for a work out and the app just sits stuck on the loading page. Can't find anything that fixes it. Keep reinstalling the app and killing my history with no results. Then randomly it will start working again...need something a little bit more predictable for it to be useful for a workout!

UPDATE: support reached out and have helped troubleshoot, very quick and responsive. Back online without any issues! Also stats were stored with FitXR team so didn't lose any data with the reinstall."
324,Morheus,Nov 12 at 10:21 AM,4,Excellent well polished exercise app,"Great fun and enjoyable exercise classes.
Unfortunately this is considering the Rand/Dollar exchange rate, too expensive and I decided to cancel the subscription. The VR app in the headset sends me to the Oculus store app on my phone, accessing the FITXR App info provides me no option to make account changes and cancel my subscription."
325,YoMomma,Nov 13 at 5:23 AM,4,Trainer‚Äôs are Loud,"Really enjoy this game/ workout, except for the trainer‚Äôs voices. There‚Äôs not an option to turn them down and hear the music. Maybe make an option for that. Maybe make an option for with sound or without. But other than that, it‚Äôs a really good full body workout. 
Thank you for making a game that is fun to play/ exercise."
326,Lomand,Nov 27 at 8:00 AM,4,Surprisingly solid fitness option,"I really enjoyed the workouts, both the music and the coaches complemented the flow perfectly. Also, quite a lot of updates. The only letdown is the performance, it feels like the app is 45fps half of the time on my quest 2."
327,Riley,Oct 2 at 4:48 PM,1,Sad,I got this game with the intention of working out with my brother. He bought this and I downloaded this for free. But I only found out that in order to play with my brother I have to have a membership. This is absolutely ridiculous. At least make multiplayer free.
328,lee,Nov 11 at 11:25 PM,4,Not a review,You could possibly work on a system that gives you a different exercise each day' ( like a my fitness goal tab) which  increases levels of intensity and difficulty and u keep getting the same one until you pass each goal helping you get better and fitter in a target based way ' u could set your targets and if you miss an exercise  day u have to do a punishment level if you want  to continue ' just a thought great app thought if not a little expensive
329,Dr D,Oct 17 at 2:45 AM,5,FitXR,Love the boxing and HIIT training.  Quite a workout but so much fun!
330,Trekeyus,Nov 11 at 7:39 PM,1,Upset with the bait and switch,Back when I purchased this app it was actually worthwhile not a subscription delivery vehicle. I haven't even bothered installing it since the made the drastic change
331,Michelle,Nov 11 at 12:37 AM,3,It is okay.,"I have been using this app several times a week with friends for the past two months. 

Pros:
1) Able to workout with friends. Enjoy having scores to make workout competive. 
2) Lots of classes to choose from with almost daily new addition. 
3) Gives you a cardio workout. 
4) No big glitches that prevent exercising. 

Cons:
1) Lots of classes to choose from, but many are very similar. 
2) The trainer avatar is useless half of the time in HIIT since they don't always mimic the following moves. 
3) Having animated avatars is not inspirational, and is distracting for me. Would be so much better when you can see the real trainer instead of an avatars that is clearly generically created to fit all classes. I suspect FITXR simply designed a bunch of moves, set the avatars to do the move (many times in HIIT, the avatar isn't even do the moves correctly), and have a voice actor to talk through the lesson.
4) Close to no instructions on how to properly exercise to prevent injuries. Not much instruction on how to fully maximize the benefits of the moves. 
5) I absolutely hate the shields in HIIT. 
6) The achievement is discouraging after obtaining the first few. The time and classes needed to unlock the later achievements is exponentially greater and make the goals feel un reachable. 

Overall: This is a okay fitness app with somethings to do. However, I would most likely unsubscribe if not for the function to be able to workout with friends."
332,Mr.ball,Aug 9 at 10:05 PM,5,The workout app I didn‚Äôt know I needed,I‚Äôve been trying to build muscle and control weight for months. Usually I start working out from a video and then do that everyday for a week and then it just gets boring and  I stop doing it. Then 2 days later I‚Äôm back to where I started. But when I tried some of these workouts on the free plan and I was sweating r like creed. So I switched to the monthly paid plan and oh god it was intense. 2 workouts in I think to the more premium workouts like expert or advanced I started to build muscle and because of that I wanted to keep it so I started to eat more healthier. Now everyone is different so it may have not have an affect on your eating habits but I just wanted to that in there. My recommendations on workouts is always start on intermediate because beginner is kinda more towards kids even if this is an Adult app and if you want to build muscle fast or want burn more calories do boxing workouts but if you want to have a slow causal workout and less sweating do hiit and dance. Overall this app is incredible and for what I have about supernatural way better and way more valuable. If you want to get fit in vr while having fun this is the best way to do it!

335,Pato,Oct 14 at 11:43 PM,3,It is Great but not that Great,"Sorry to say it but les mills bodycombat vr it‚Äôs much more better in term‚Äôs of cardio and boxing and It is a one-time payment application.

But I like this one because it has WARM UP, COOL DOWNS, DANCE?, HIIT and more.

I only have a few points to criticize:

- Some times targets moves very fast and it is difficult to hit them, I mean it.

- The 3D model of the trainers are lame, instead I would put a video of the trainer with a green screen

- It is has some problems loading some areas of the application, i have to close the application and reopen it

- The subscription AFTER the first class it‚Äôs a SCAM and FRAUD.

- Long workouts are very repetitive and boring.

- In some workout the trainer doesn‚Äôt talk and it‚Äôs not motivated.

- Intermediate feels like expert, expert feels like expert+

- And some times the target doesn‚Äôt match with my punch even if I hit them perfectly and I don‚Äôt take points."
336,GiaSvera5973,Jul 30 at 9:49 AM,5,Enjoy it.,I've been using this app for about a month. I absolutely love it.  It doesn't feel like a boring workout. It's FUN.  I enjoy the dancing .. HIIT .. but i gotta say the boxing is my FAVORITE. I feel like I've done all of them but i would be lying haha. There are so many classes to choose from .. You can do a 6 minute to 25 minute workout. When I'm done I'm drenched.  I like how you can go from beginner .. intermediate .. to advance ..  expert. You also have several different trainers  different kind of music as well.  If you could add maybe some Latin music that would be Awesome. Other then that I'm enjoying. Thank you

I finish every workout, I‚Äôm sweating like crazy, feeling good and I always come back the next day to workout again. There‚Äôs so many classes to choose from. There‚Äôs always a new workout to try out. I highly recommend! It‚Äôs affordable and you don‚Äôt have to leave home."
346,Steven,Jun 15 at 5:15 AM,5,I change my mind,"This app is not getting enough credit. The first time I tried, I didn‚Äôt like the graphics of the boxing compared to Supernatural so I gave up right away. Months later, I needed something different so I came back and tried all boxing, Hiit, and dance so far and I was drench sweating out of breath in a good way. The Hiit had some fun sessions like playing a game. I felt bad about my first review and I take it back. These guys are really trying. They‚Äôre putting a lot of content. And I‚Äôm enjoying it so yea. Yea the graphics especially in boxing needs to be polished and smooth but the music is really fun, the trainers are great, seeing other user names and a score board keeps me going, and I‚Äôm still getting a really great effective work out. I‚Äôm sticking around."
347,Sane Brooks,Jul 23 at 6:24 AM,5,Man I tell you what,"I thought this was going to be a bad attempt, but I truly enjoyed myself. My body felt the burn and I think of you haven‚Äôt given it a try you most definitely should. Even if you stop after the trial you‚Äôll like it. It‚Äôs pretty fun and you‚Äôre technically not alone there others there with you lol"
348,ElPelonachas12,Aug 12 at 1:51 AM,5,Great app but...,"I love playing this game, makes me sweat and sore every time. even the free version is great but one thing i dislike are the people who just try to beat the high score by just waving there arms. Im very competitive and i like to be first so i try my hardest everytime but there is always someone that cheats their way to first or second by waving their arms around doing the bare minimum. Dont be one of those. But its a great game and i highly recommend it to stay in shape or lose weight."
349,WATARU,Sep 23 at 12:13 PM,1,Music and punch timing don't match.,"This is a critical bug.

It is about the BOX, but the timing of the music and the punch does not match.


The quality is so high that I want to get a subscription, but because of this fatal bug, I will not purchase it.


I will not subscribe unless this discrepancy between the music and the punches is resolved.


Please improve this issue as soon as possible."
350,Rafa,Aug 21 at 3:15 AM,5,Fun and a good workout,True the free trial with the intention of cancelling before the deadline but instantly became hooked. I really enjoy the boxing because it is fun and a get a good sweat in. I use this app everyday so it is well worth the subscription price for me.
351,Martin,Aug 1 at 6:50 PM,1,SCAM. I would like a refund,"There's a lot of people suggesting revisiting this app. I would love to if they gave me my purchase price back - switching to subscription was a scam. 

If you have reviewed before this was switched to a subscription game don't forget YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR REVIEW AND RATING AT ANY TIME.

Updated Oct 21:
It's also great to see Beat Saber thriving with their honest business model - I bet they are selling lots of DLC and their 38,000 ratings with an average of 4.6 stars shows that they have made good decisions.  I remember when you had mostly positive reviews too. 

They have also made their Facebook group private.

Updated Aug 21:
Never played this game since they started charging for a subscription after paying full price for it. I have noticed that they have set a private and heavily moderated group up on Facebook - no negativity in there. They have also deleted almost all of the negative comments made on their Facebook page. There seems to be a lot of new 5 star reviews on here too..........

At least those who sign up now haven't had to buy the game. I would still like a refund.

Further update:
I asked you to remove me from the free  trial subscription in a support ticket and you responded that you would if I provided my account number. You then responded with the same script that it was free etc.. but didn't remove me. You have now started charging people who are on free trials. This is getting very serious now as UK law doesn't allow you to place people under contract without their consent. This has now gone too far. Please contact me.


Update: If you own this - you are entered into a trial subscription without being asked if you want to or not. I am not sure that this legal. I have written to them and Oculus advising that I do not wish to subscribe (even for free for 90 days). Legally they cannot make you take even a free subscription.


This was a pretty good game but they decided to move to an expensive subscription service. (Maybe ¬£2 or ¬£3 would seem reasonable but much more expensive). Now they claim that it will retain existing features but I can't see them developing the 'pre paid' game alongside the subscription service. I think you should have released something separately rather than doing this. It's nice to know that those who paid upfront have helped you to develop a a cash machine rather than continue to support the current model. What you have done would have been acceptable if this had started out as a free game rather than a premium title . You could make this good by refunding existing owners of the game (a free subscription trial is not the same thing). I guess that won't happen as you have already spent our cash developing a subscription service. I know you won't start handing cash back to people so I can only hope this error of judgement is reflected in your bottom line profit."
352,Chris,Sep 23 at 6:02 AM,5,I hate working out‚Ä¶,‚Ä¶but FitXR actually makes it so much fun that I‚Äôm enjoying it.
353,ChildOfChaos,Jul 27 at 10:58 PM,5,Great. Highly recommended.,"I use this every day as I work from home and want to not be stationary all the time.

I've always hated exercise and never been the sporty type, but understand the health benefits of exercise and movement. I bought my quest entirely for this reason in the hope that I could find some way to exercise and move that I would enjoy.

FitXR is the service that has fully realised this for me. I try to do around an hour a day and make sure I get my heart rate up, I added some wrist weights from the official store which helps make the workout effect even better and also use some resistance bands. It's honestly been one of the biggest life improvements I have made over the past few years, I feel great after completing my workout and the buzz lasts for hours afterwards, with new classes added daily I never really get bored and with the level of engagement it has, I don't notice i'm even exercising.  

There have been a few bumps along the way with various updates etc, but FitXR keeps getting better and keeps adding value. I highly recommend it."
354,Serabo89,Sep 13 at 5:01 AM,1,Embarrassing!,"If this is the app worth ‚Äúrevisiting‚Äù than I couldn‚Äôt imagine how horrible it was before! 

Presentation is lazy. They have still photos of the trainers, but it‚Äôs a computer avatar, not a green screen video.

I can only play the boxing since NONE of the other exercise work well enough worth the time to play.

I‚Äôm getting sound cues on every ball I hit in boxing, but it‚Äôll just kill my streak, I know I‚Äôm hitting them, but the game doesn‚Äôt care.

This also effects my standing on that leader board, which is bothersome to see my low scores due to glitches.

Don‚Äôt even bother with the free trial. Just play supernatural.

Oh btw, the music SUCKS!"

361,Lenny,Aug 7 at 9:32 PM,5,Great game!,This is a fun way to work out with lots of different workouts to choose from. Usually I cannot be bothered to work out but this makes it easier because as I said before it is very fun and you can play it for a while and you won‚Äôt get bored. This game deserves more credit because not many people notice it.
362,Anthonygrimm,Jul 19 at 3:19 AM,5,As a 60 year old who needs to workout.,As I am over 62 and just purchased Oculus Qest 2.

363,Elke,Aug 8 at 6:20 PM,5,Great Great Great,"I‚Äôve been using it for a little over half a year now and I still play it a couple of times per week. I love how versatile it is and it never gets boring. The music is good, the trainers as well and with the new meta avatar it feels at lot more personal playing with others as well. I feel like this is one of the few games where the developers actually listen to what people say. I will renew my yearly subscription."

I use this, Les Mills, beat sabers. I'm toning up losing weight and I feel as if I'm getting in shape but I don't feel like I'm working out! I use the boxing it is so much fun I really would recommend this it's so much fun that it keeps me going."

Looking through my apps I said d@#n we have this one played the 12min hit challenge and I say I was dripping sweat like I've never dripped before off of 12 minutes.  This game is gonna be my best friend. Can't wait to see what el a e it has to offer."
368,Claire,Jul 6 at 10:02 AM,5,Great app make great workouts for all,"Updated Review.

I finally managed to find and swap the subscription from yearly to monthly in the App via subscriptions. It's a lot cheaper to take out a yearly subscription but not in my budget at the moment. 

Very happy to be able to continue with a monthly subscription. 

The workouts are varied and interesting there's workouts for all including a small selection of seated workouts. 

There are features that help keep you motivated to keep trying and improving. 








I signed up to the free trial and really enjoyed the workouts. Even for someone as unfit as myself I found workouts that I could do and find enjoyable. 

I was all set to continue my subscription after reading it was ¬£7.99 a month I thought it was affordable and worthwhile: I have a charge for ¬£63.99, luckily I have a bank with virtual cards that are linked to pots for specific things like this so it won't take from needed money and so it was declined. 

That's one heck of a difference whilst I feel mislead this could be something I've pressed wrongly but it seems difficult to find how where to check and or change this. 

Great app in terms of workouts for all abilities, great for tracking progress be wary of the subscription."
369,Yssa,Sep 16 at 11:19 AM,5,Love it!,Workouts are so much fun and have me sweating more than I ever have

371,GeeGee,Jul 18 at 9:47 PM,5,Love it,I absolutely love this app I have had it for a few months but did not really take the time to enjoy the graphics and workouts of FitXR. I always usually start out with a 8 to 11 minute beginner workout and I can tell you that I am not exhausted and I definitely get a great sweat every time this app is very enjoyable I just wish that there were more background graphics but I'm sure they will fit it in very soon.

373,Joseph Ryan Wolf,Aug 6 at 7:38 AM,5,Overall I love it however some caviets,"Overall I love it, i give it 4.8 out of 5.  This is just me, but i cant stand working out to hip hop; its just not my thing.  Their were some slightly heavier songs.  It would get a perfect score if we were allowed to upload or  own music.   Death Metal is great to workout too.  Cannibal corpse especially has some of the fastest guitar riffs in the world and power metal has some insanely fast songs we could workout to.   A couple of songs come to mind Cannibal corpse Shatter their bones and Priest of Sodom. Dragon force, any song will do, I understand there might be copyright issues.  But have it linked to Itunes ,  I have all Cannibal Corspe, Korn, Slayer , Slipknot etc... 
You know how fun it is to workout to My Plague,  Got the Life and Raining Blood 
Slipknot, Korn, Slayer if we could add those it would be a 6/5 extra credit"

392,Green Officer,Aug 10 at 5:34 AM,5,Excellent workout,"This app may not have realistic graphics, but the workouts are very well structured with motivating coaches and music. Comparing to other apps it is cheaper but giving the same or even better experience comparable to workout in real gym."

394,Tyler,Jul 11 at 9:09 PM,5,Excellent,"My main reason for buying the oculus was my sister said she does workouts on hers. Drastic but I decided to spend the hundreds of pounds to see if she was right. 
 I absolutely love it. I've thrashed her high score which is a bonus, I'm ok with most of the exercises but mainly I love the boxing ones, I really feel like a boxer but my body feels like I'm too old (every muscle is aching just like it should after a workout) 
 You get points for jabbing, upper punch and side punching the orbs, but you get more points for actually throwing a decent punch, the money this costs as the monthly fee is absolutely worth it as at the moment I won't be joining a gym (it's too hot and I'm too paranoid about my weight) 
 Couple of suggestions would be a weight goal with bi daily checkins to see the changes, and real time workouts with other players would be cool, and sending the workout I just did to my sister so she can try and beat my score"

397,Anna,Jul 4 at 5:50 AM,5,I‚Äôm really enjoying this!,"My favorite first parts of the experience is that there‚Äôs a tutorial that gives you a vibe for the game BEFORE being promoted to subscribe and that you can do an additional free class. I just signed up for the free week and will definitely be trying this for the next month (and then probably pre paying for the year to get a discount from $9.99 to $6.99).

I‚Äôve never done other boxing games on Oculus but I really enjoy the game format- the bubbles coming at you give guitar hero/ beat saber vibes but boxing style and I just have a ton of fun. I also get competitive and enjoy the optional leaderboard!"
398,Brian,Jun 30 at 2:36 PM,1,Dont do the free trial,I decided to try out fit xr since they offered a 5 day trial period. Then on the 6th day they took 124 dollars off my card since its saved to the meta store without my permission. Very disappointed in the way the games pay feature is set up.

401,Megan,Jun 23 at 5:33 AM,1,Switch to sub model is lame.,I‚Äôve bought this game on 3 different platforms because I enjoyed it so much.

This is a slap in the face to all the people who supported this app for years. Bad move. I won‚Äôt recommend this to anyone anymore.
402,Teezy,Aug 27 at 11:10 PM,3,,"Pros:
1) Graphics/ visuals are still nice from it's original game title or better
2) You still get a nice full body workout

Cons:
1) I'm definitely not a fan of the subscription, still after previously owning the original game from PlayStation as well.

2) I would rather buy the game outright to have the settings of the original gameplay at least.
 *A nice focused workout without any classes nor instructor commentary in your ear would be nice.
 *The ability to set my own personal challenges with workout time durations and record achievements would be good.

3) this is kind of being picky, but the music selection is not the greatest in my own opinion.
 * For example when choosing a genre of music to box to, it shuffles in and out of the genre which throws off the rhythm. Specifically when choosing the energetic hip Hop, the music drifts off into some other form of music then back again. It gets to the point where I rather not listen to any of the music.

Conclusion: 
- Overall it would be nice to have a subscription with classes only as an option and still have a full game experience without it"

I return to work in three weeks and I will definitely add this to my daily routine along with the other exercises I do to help me on my road of recovery.
409,Adam,Jun 23 at 12:42 AM,5,A great workout at a good value,"If you want a VR game which will genuinely get you working up a sweat and feel like it‚Äôs contributing to your fitness then Fit XR is the answer. It‚Äôs a travesty that it only has an average 3/5 review score.

My wife and I use it almost every day. The boxing and HiiT are particularly good. I use the dance one less - because I‚Äôm awful at dancing but also because it doesn‚Äôt feel it takes as much advantage of the VR technology as it ought to. But even just doing boxing and Hiit every day feels good value for a monthly subscription of less than a tenner. 

Neither my wife and I are gym goers. Fit XR has drastically increased the amount of fitness we do as it is so convenient. I have certainly felt an increase in strength after about two months. The key is this feels something we can stick to.

The virtual trainers do a good job of encouraging you (and great that GB boxing legend Nicola Adams is on - please give us more!). The music is mostly unknown but still decent and I like that it gives a platform to new artists. And the sessions themselves all feel different, so every day there is something new. I also applaud the difficulty levels - they increase at manageable levels, and even beginner will leave you in a sweat. Boxing in particular just feels so good, nothing like ducking under a barrier and then hitting with an upper cut. Genuinely fun and getting a streak going is very rewarding. Trying to beat other users scores as you go through the session also keeps things interesting.

Despite this praise, it still feels like this game has so much potential to be even better.

Improvements could include:

Statistics: would be great if the info on your performance was kept as a running total. Also ability to play against yourself in order to get PB. And able to see what other profiles using the account have got.

Variety: Would be great to have an additional mode. Perhaps a mechanism where you hit something back with a bat or racquet.

Boxing: throughout a session trainers gear you up for the final fight but when this happens it is a little underwhelming. Even something like the lighting changing would be nice. Ideally some kind of optional ‚Äòboss‚Äô that you ‚Äòcompeted‚Äô against. Hi"

I like boxing, and the competition element in Fit, with its scoring and punch power tracking is great. 
The locations and music in Fit are a bit boring and the trainer interaction feels a little too generic. What really puts me off of FitXR is that the punch timing to the music is BAD, if they were to dial that in it would make a world of difference for me, but as it stands, it feels like the music and punching are independent of each other, like you are boxing with music in the background. With Supernatural I feel like the punching and music are married. 
They are both good in their own way, if it comes down to price, and you aren't bothered by the music and punch timing then FitXR is a good deal, but for me the near perfect punch timing, more interesting and diverse locations, better coaching interactions are worth the extra cost."
411,David,Jul 13 at 5:06 PM,5,After 2 years I gave it a try,"So I finally decided to use FitXR, I was doubtful if this application could be a good incorporation to my daily exercise‚Ä¶ so recently downloaded and I‚Äôd have liked to download it earlier‚Ä¶ I was sweating a lot! Great app

I will start after the trial w one month and evaluate if yearly subscription costs is worth it ;)"

414,James69,Sep 13 at 8:39 AM,4,CARDIO FIT ENDURANCE ENHANCE,"This is a great way to shed pounds. With proper dieting and consistency, you'll definitely lose weight and gain more confidence since there's others to compete with in the workout vr room. It's very motivating. The warmups you can skip. Just get a 3 to 5 minute warmup and stretches done before you begin any of the workouts. The 10.00 a month subscription is worth it. I'll pay for this, over  2 subway pound packing sandwiches."

There's just not anything there to grab my attention and nothing to pay once for certain content with the option to buy more later. Its all or nothing and over ¬£60 a year is too much sorry."

They make it super easy to subscribe but very difficult to unsubscribe. I've looked on the game the app and the online store. According to oculus support you need to contact them directly. Shouldn't be that difficult.

Figured it out in settings purchasing details for anyone that's looking. I still think it should be able to be done from the app! (Changed my review from 1 to 3 stars)."

- dont ask me session review(stars)
- dont ask home environment setting when I choosed in a day (I just wanna quick play)
- public realtime multiplay session
- it need to change people position and ui layout (e.g time with progress bar)
- more glove and bubble style
- more language!"
430,TeaRekt,"May 4, 2022 at 3:42 AM",5,Great work out for a decent price,"I‚Äôve tried both FItXR and Supernatural

While Supernatural is really pretty, I find the UI cumbersome to use, it‚Äôs hard to find something I want and jump right in.

I love that FItXR has their newest workouts up front so I can easily choose something new and immediately start. While it‚Äôs not as aesthetically pleasing as supernatural, I find the workouts far more challenging. Their HIIT workout actually forces you to work your lower body unlike a lot of other fitness apps (most just have you squat) with side lunges, pivot lunges, squats, and general side to side movement at a fast pace. Their boxing is hit or miss for me but mostly because it uses a force meter and sometimes I have a hard time getting the right amount of force behind an uppercut. The dancing workout could have more variety in moves and act more like dancing - as it stands it‚Äôs more like the HIIT workout without the targets to break. 

Overall it‚Äôs the best workout app to me. Plus it helps that FitXR is cheaper, it would be nice to have a base paid model with optional subscription but this app definitely has the variety of workouts to replace my gym membership."
431,Marisol,Jan 5 at 5:25 PM,2,Graphics need help,Graphics on the game is not good. Felt like I was working out in 80s graphics on VR. Needs more work. I also didn‚Äôt like being in a room with other people. I want a solo workout.
432,Andrea,Sep 7 at 7:48 AM,1,Charged fpr year without permission,"I wouldn‚Äôt mind monthly, but getting charged for the whole year unexpectedly? That‚Äôs BS! Game not worth it at all!!!!!"
433,Ash,Jul 16 at 4:06 PM,5,Love it But,I wish the free workouts would change and not be the same ones I‚Äôm a single mom can‚Äôt do another monthly bill but I love this game even tho they are the same work outs I do them 30 mins a day  and I sweat love this game!!!!! Just wish more was free
434,Nidalee,Jun 7 at 10:10 AM,4,Excellent Variety Workout,"So, I have been using this workout app since November and honestly it has been way cheaper than going to a gym and feeling like I'm stared at. I did lose roughly 24 lbs and I did have to take off 2 months roughly. I also didn't change much in my diet during my journey. I work out 4 times a week.

Only reason why I won't make it 5 stars is sometimes ill be doing moves and it isn't accurately registering. It may be the app or just Quest 2 issue who knows. 

The best update added to this workout was indeed the pre workout and cooldown options! Thank you so much for adding this in!!! 

I've tested supernatural vs fitxr and honestly I felt more worked out during fitxr and feeling like there is more variety than Supernatural + cheaper. However if you're interested in music that you know then supernatural has it. It wasn't enough to keep me continuing because fitXR I've noticed changes and I didn't feel like I'm forced into only Beat Saber style or boxing. With fitXR it provides boxing, dancing [don't underestimate this workout] and HIIT.

Hopefully this review may help others and please don't get thrown off with the ratings on this application. It has gone a positive long way listening to their audience!"
435,Rob,Aug 5 at 1:02 AM,1,"not accurate, not good","With Supernatural around, this is just a cheaper bugged version. Some of the boxing combos are completely nonsensical. Just thrown in by a programmer with no clue how to box. No difficulty progression at all, just intensity levels. Good luck stringing combos together as this game is not very accurate and must take more luck to hit the target because skill isn‚Äôt a factor with how buggy and unresponsive it gets while playing. In short, you can sweat and workout but don‚Äôt expect it to be accurate."
436,Indra,Sep 26 at 7:04 AM,1,Too bad,"I am not really happy with Fit XR.. BOX VR much better , I can play offline, but now I can't, if I purchase ads-ons BOX VR Extreme pack can I play offline like BOX VR"

441,Nathan,Jul 28 at 12:21 AM,5,Best exercise experience,This app is great. It does cost 89.99 for the year but it has let me make 3 profiles so far and the workouts are great. There is several different coaches and it feels like they are right there cheering you on.
442,Christine,Jun 11 at 9:22 AM,5,Worth the cost,"I believe FitXR is worth using.  Try it, by signing up for the 7-day trial.  Choose a week that you will be able to use the app daily.  It would be more of an incentive to use it daily, so you can use the features fully.

I actually signed up for the 7-day trial, used it 2 or 3 days, and forgot to cancel before my card was charged.  Outside, of paying for a gym membership, this app will have you sweating and working out your whole body.

I never knew how involved a fitness program through VR could actually be effective.  This was a happy mistake and technically the cost is practical.  Based on what you have access to, including new videos weekly and other enhanced features, this is a great fitness app for me."
443,Timbued,Jul 9 at 5:40 PM,1,Just keeps getting worst.,"First you force-change it to a monthly sub after so many of us purchased it and now you are forcing woke rubbish down our throats.

444,Saif Abbas,Jul 6 at 12:10 PM,5,Super good,"One of the best workout apps, it got everything you need. Smooth movement, nice ambiance and pure fun. I like the boxing workout, it got so many moves, much better then the other boxing apps"
445,Ana,Sep 3 at 6:42 PM,4,Not bad,"I was a little skeptical at the beginning, but it actually helps me to move more, and it's quite engaging. Even if it seems that you have a lot of classes to choose from, many of them are quite similar. I'd like to have more environments."
446,Ante,Aug 25 at 5:14 PM,3,ADD LEADERBOARDS! ADD EM!,"Looks like leaderboards are possibly being tested in the Scoreboards app, with 5 songs showing up but not tracking score. Please enable this and it's an auto five star and subscription from me.

Update after developers response, good to hear it might be added soon, I've subscribed to the trial and might just continue afterwards since the game has improved quite a bit since the update especially if global leaderboards will be added."
447,Joe Amadeus,Aug 25 at 9:22 PM,1,Needs Improvement,"FitXR looks like a lot of thought and care was put into the aesthetic, workouts, and user interface to make it a fun virtual reality experience. When compared to other fitness games like Beat Saber, Supernatural, and Les Mills however, this game falls short. 

Here are my critiques: 
1. The trainers look horrible. Why not just make the trainer look like a meta quest character with legs and feet? Or do what supernatural and les mills does and record people into the game? 

2. The workouts are spaced weird. All the workouts involve hitting orange and blue targets, but when they appear on screen, they are too far from the player. I tried changing settings around but it still happens. It‚Äôs weird. Bring the targets closer to the player. I‚Äôve never had this issue on any other VR games before. 

3. The user interface is confusing. Les Mills and Supernatural make it pretty simple on what kind of experience you‚Äôll get. FitXR gives you generic titles and types, but doesn‚Äôt exactly make it clear what you‚Äôre doing. 

4. The activities are just not fun. They are definitely a workout, but they just aren‚Äôt as fun and don‚Äôt exactly make me feel engaged. 

So there you have it. If FitXR can fix a lot of this, then I‚Äôll definitely update my review. But where it stands there are much better fitness programs on the quest 2."
448,Alana16,Aug 6 at 3:28 AM,4,LOVE ITTT ONLY A FEW CONS,(Plz ignore my terrible grammer lol)I LOVE FIT XR IT ALWAYS GETS ME SO SWEATY AND THE TRAINERS LIKE SARAH AND GARRET ARE SO ENTHUSIASTIC AND FUN TO WORK OUT WITH.The price to do the full fit FR is a little too high but totally worth it.WARNING IF YOU DO THE 6.99 a month thing they will take out 90$ out your account like a weeek after you sign up idk why don‚Äôt ask me.There is new classes every week and stufff which is cool I just wish they added new environments for you to work out in like mystical environments Yk?

453,Annette,Jun 21 at 2:51 AM,5,Great work out,I tried one of the different workout apps and I didn‚Äôt like it and so I tried this one for the seven days and I was hooked I love the boxing part of it. Even my 15-year-old daughter is doing the boxing now and if you really do it and you really try hard and work really hard on it and really use your muscles and do exactly what they‚Äôre saying to get on the leaderboard you can lose the weight. Love it
454,George,Jul 20 at 1:10 AM,4,Subscription is worth it now,"I am a long time legacy user right after BoxVr became FitXr. 
When they changed to a subscription model as well leaving the legacy owners the freedom to stay on the old courses I rambled because performance of the app regarding hit markers and music was awful. The very first new content was kind of just set here and there some orbs along with the music but it felt not being well thought out and some moves became uncontrolled just to stay in streak. 
Meanwhile a lot changed with new trainer voices, I do say this by purpose, and the music is motivating. 
What I don‚Äôt like:
Get rid of the robotic animated puppies. They destroy the immersion. I want to have a real person in front of me showing the real stuff. Warming up and cool down are a great add but do add more variety to them instead the 2 trainers. 
As well you have to check the skill level you are setting. I did a an intermediate course which easily could have been advanced for my taste. 
Avatars now are nice and give a personal feel to the competition. 
If the above will be addressed, you have my last star"
455,ImperfectlySandi,Aug 19 at 3:45 AM,4,Good second boxing exercise,"I got this program to have a backup boxing exercise to my SN. This is definitely not as good as SN but it still provides a good workout. Admittedly, the warm up and cool downs are better than SN but the exercise is done in avatar mode which is not as impressive and a bit clunky. I will keep it for now."
456,Rayne,Aug 19 at 4:10 AM,4,Hands always go missing,"I like the game but the hands always end up disconnecting and I have to pause to recalibrate them. This doesn‚Äôt happen with any other app. Also, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúreal‚Äù music i.e. by popular artists the way Supernatural has. The major advantage you guys have is that the workouts are much more interactive than the repetitive motions in other workout apps.  The HIIT workouts are amazing."
457,Tracey,Jun 7 at 1:42 PM,5,I love the boxing!,"I started with the free classes and just bought the membership and I love this app!

460,JD,Jul 9 at 4:25 PM,1,Bad all around,"This app is supposed to be about fitness. Yet the first thing you see once you pay the subscription is woke garbage.

Recommendation: remove the woke agenda and it will be an average game. Keep it and I‚Äôll never use it."
461,EAGLE,Aug 17 at 4:38 PM,4,"Great cardio, and solid combo trainer","As a guy who takes real life MMA classes, these virtual Boxing and HIIT classes are awesome! The in game coaches remind you of the fundamentals, the music is pretty good ( personally wish for more anime style fight music, I'm a bit of a weeb lol), and at the end of each lesson I'm drenched in sweat, standing in a puddle of even more sweat! Honestly when I first opened the app I was somewhat put off by the flamboyant design choices at first, letting others from my class give it a go I'm not the only one, but once the classes started we could all agree that this app rocks! Overall it's great cardio and offers solid supplemental training for Boxing depending on how serious you take it."
462,Theo Guedes,Aug 20 at 4:24 PM,3,Some unnecessary annoyances,"The app is not bad... but the 3d models of the coaches are not good enough. The coaches's commentaries aren't engaging enough for me.

466,Mslovely,Aug 17 at 5:21 AM,4,So much potential,"I bought this app on a whim and I have to say they are definitely on to something. üî•üî•
There's definitely many opportunities to improve like graphics, environment picture quality. The fitness app Supernatural definitely blows this app's environment out of the water. But they clearly have a differentuser persona they are targeting.
 The multiplayer aspect and the home environments  definitely make this stand out for me. Having the coach there is cool but the avatar needs to grow more.
 It is evident in the quality of the ux/ui, the workouts and the gaming aspect, the creators really wanted people to enjoy working out. From start to finish. üíú
I've only played for two days and I wish they were hiring for program managers. I'm so inspired to support the growth of this. 
Do yourself a favor and go download. 

Suggestions to the developers, would creating a ""lounge"" of sorts be too complicated to code in? 
What if there was a waiting area or lounge in the game. People could interact and decide to workout together."

This is okay app and I probably would have bought it if it wasn't subscription only. Really not a fan of most of the graphics, they are cheesy and glitchy. Even though my height is in the app there are some exercises that in order to complete, the height I need to reach is uncomfortable and has me full on my toes . 

I'll stick with Les Mills for now."

They go way beyond those goofy sticks in Supernatural. They keep me guessing, they keep it fresh, and have me ready to tap out halfway through a session. Supernatural comes with the same crap, same sceneries and same music."
480,Gina.Ragazzini,"Apr 27, 2022 at 4:31 AM",5,Daily User,I am n my 50's and love this.  I started working out again but had to talk myself into it daily.  I started using fit XR and I don't want to stop.  I work from home so my goal is to do 2 short workouts and a longer one once daily.  I often add additional workouts because it is so fun it's not like working out.  I feel like I had a good workout when I feel sweaty and boy do you sweat.  Boxing is my favorite but I am working on learning the HIIT and starting to really like it too.  Absolutely would recommend giving it a try.
481,Emiliorth,Jul 31 at 9:47 PM,4,Best!!!,"I don't get why people prefer other fit and boxing games than this one. Real graphic textures are just ugly. Fit XR with it's almost simple graphics, but still in modern taste is imo best and very clean when it comes to visibility. The game by itself is just a blast! Me and my wife just love it, where HIIT and dance modes are just awesome addition!!!
Only con for me it's the precision and feedback of hitting the bubbles. It's really hard or impossible to keep streak when you are giving all of yourself"
482,Rudi Adianto,Aug 12 at 4:20 AM,4,Good to add variety to your exercise,"My go to fitness app is Less Mills Body Combat. However that app is very rarely updated and after 2 months of almost everyday usage I just needed to add variety.
For that purpose, I found FitXR is almost perfect. This has variety of classes and instructors, variety of exercise, variety of music is huge.

However, compared to Less Mills, FitXR feels to have ""less impact"". It's small things that adds up; one example is the sound of ""balloon pops"" when you hit the target. That sound effect alone almost botched it for me. To the devs, please change or add option to change the sound effect that enhance the impactful feeling."
483,Dane,Jul 8 at 7:20 PM,5,Fitxr,Love the boxing part of this app. It‚Äôs fun and a wonderful workout! Dance and hiit is great for the kids and people that enjoy that type of thing but the boxing really is awesome.
484,irivadeneyra,Jul 20 at 12:29 AM,5,Super App,"Unbelievable workout that is funny,  entertainment and excellent music. Very empowering"
485,Nicolas Holm,Sep 24 at 6:34 PM,1,bull,"i cant even subscribe. been trying for 3 hours now, just take my money ffs"
486,Manga G,"May 4, 2022 at 2:15 AM",5,Love it!,"I got this app a few months ago and never tried it. Lately, I‚Äôve been wanting to exercise more and decided to give this app a try. I can assure you I don‚Äôt regret it. I‚Äôm learning boxing on this alongside other people, and having a blast. 

The only downside is that calibration is a tiny bit off, but that doesn‚Äôt bother me a whole lot. I never really got into exercise until I tried this. This made exercise way more fun!"
487,Luke,Aug 28 at 3:07 AM,1,Why a subscription,Why make a game free and then make you buy a subscription why not make a game cost like $20 and no subscription
488,Dr.Jefe,Jun 19 at 8:47 AM,5,Sweat with your Friends!,Who doesn‚Äôt enjoy a good work out with friends. I bought this because of the multiplayer component and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. All of us are hooked and we keep each other accountable. Highly recommend this app. Great variety. Boxing is my favorite.
489,Luna,Jul 28 at 6:38 PM,1,Will not load when trying out free trial,"Cannot give a good rating as I cannot try anything on this game other than the one demo go, each time I click to the free trial it just stays in loading and does nothing else. I have tried uninstalling and it just does the same thing over and over again. Any one have and ideas why?"
490,Shannon,Jul 23 at 8:14 PM,4,My favorite so far,FitXr makes me sweat! It's definitely my favorite of the fitness apps because the music is decent and the workouts are great. The voice coaches are pretty good too. Not annoying like some of the other apps. Just the right amount of push and motivation.
491,Wendi,Aug 26 at 11:01 PM,1,Rug pull,App development 101: don't start charging for functionality that was free when users bought your product.
492,kimcsniper,Oct 4 at 6:32 PM,1,It' not free,Only the tutorial is free
493,Leakypoos,Aug 4 at 6:50 PM,5,,This really deserves more stars. The exercises in this are incredible.
494,Charlie,Aug 5 at 3:24 PM,4,Good for older people - except the music,"I am 65 and bought a headset a few weeks back as I was interested in fitness programmes I could do whilst working from home. Having got to the end of Ring Fit Adventure on the Switch this seemed like the next step. I would say that I am definitely enjoying it and finding it a good workout that fits in easily with my schedule. I can't compare it to the other programs because I don't want too many subscriptions. I'm pretty amazed by the graphics and enjoying the workouts. I like seeing the other avatars in the class and the leader boards give you something to work towards. I even came third in intermediate boxing the other day! I am enjoying the Hiit classes as well although I do find the moves similar in different classes. I'm not great at the dancing but wasn't last either so that's something. It certainly makes me feel I'm moving and working up a sweat, although that might be around the headset. Very enjoyable but the music choice is geared to young people. It would be lovely if there were choices for us oldies. I'd like to see some longer stretching classes as well."
495,Faith,Jun 8 at 9:38 PM,5,Uniquely Challenging and Rewarding,"I love the developers‚Äô commitment to listening and constantly improving the user experience. There was a time when I thought that Supernatural would provide everything I need in a VR workout; I‚Äôm so glad that I kept my FitXR subscription. The HIIT, Dance, and accessible workouts are incredible, along with well planned warmups that are housed in their own studio. Furthermore, the style of boxing is different from Supernatural ‚Äî in a good way. I highly recommend adding this to your library, especially if you workout significantly in VR!"
496,Muparadzi81,"Apr 21, 2022 at 10:46 PM",5,Keep up the great work!!!,"As the app keeps maturing I am pleased to see that the developer has kept on improving the app from where it was, even did a workout with warm up and cool down. Granted not a fan of the subscription however most of the fitness app for content and licencing would require this and has become the norm for most of the good ones as well. I have also noticed that trainers have improved with the level of apps and movements required for box and hiit (not a user of the dance however partner [female] uses/prefers dance and hiit).  Please keep going with improvements as this is a great app and really sold me and this is from an avid and regular user of the app and my go to for my vr fitness. To those who have never used vr fitness there is a great way to still go but the direction for fitness at least in vr is very encouraging indeed and for some can meet fitness needs."
497,shinabi87,"May 9, 2022 at 2:32 PM",5,This is a life changing app ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ,"I have never written a review for any app before but I just had to write one for FitXR as I think it is one of the best things I have in my life.

I am a 40(ish ahem!) year old working mum of 2 toddlers and I have no time for taking good care of myself, or so I thought. Between childcare and a busy job, proper fitness was at the bottom of what seemed accessible to me. I read an article on VR fitness and I decided to get myself an Oculus and give it a try. Its been a few weeks and FitXR has changed my life!

WHY I LIKE FITXR
‚òÖ It‚Äôs effective ‚òÖ - I love dancing socially, and frequented spin and cardio classes till a few years ago and missed the energy of a good workout. Even some of the beginning classes in FitXR are as good a workout!! I never boxed before, and had to try a few classes to get my timing right but the other classes were easy to get into. I can see that the workouts are already bringing my strength back to my core, shoulders, bum and back.

‚òÖ It is fun! ‚òÖ- Hitting balls to the beat of music is so satisfying! I must admit I am not much of a gamer so I got intimidated by the scoreboard in the beginning but now I find myself trying to stay high on the board all the time. HIIT is a bit harder to beat the scores but is full of new moves every class. Love the dance routines too!!

‚òÖIt‚Äôs great value for money‚òÖ - Instead of crashing in front of Netflix at the end of the day now I opt to end the day with a nightcap of a workout. Feels great to end on a high! Love the daily workouts because they have different music every day and add so much variety. Great value for what I am paying monthly!!

‚òÖThe company seems to be doing a good job of posting updates with new features too‚òÖ


IMPROVEMENTS I WOULD LIKE
-I would have loved to see a community in the app of other people playing FitXR.
-I would love to see more hiphop and pop music.
-There is not enough guidance on posture and form
-Dance could be a bit more DDR like"
498,Vertilex,"May 1, 2022 at 4:19 PM",5,Life Changing!,I love it so much . I'm training BOX in my kitchen. I get a work out. I've tried a dance work out aswell. It's so good because I'm working my fitness up in private in my kitchen..lol!!! And the instructors are So good. Just have to get used to only seeing hands when I do the fitness stretches and look down for  my foot placement and need a headset strap that doesnt slip!
499,Tomasz,Jun 19 at 1:39 PM,1,Unethical and overpriced subscription,"I was under the impression that I can buy modules and pay for each once, like in beat saber, where you extend the workout with new music and environments. The content is not changing here, it's the same environments, workouts, the app basically stays the same, yet they charge nearly ¬£8 every month. The model is unethical, as they don't provide any added value here, no service that you need to play it, it's purely for their pockets."
500,cb,"May 30, 2022 at 3:32 AM",1,Why did I bother to buy BoxVR??,"Sad that a game can charge for one title, then have the ability to change the name and turn into a subscription‚Ä¶.leaving you with no point in buying the game to begin with, as you have to pay for everything.  Probably should have just reimbursed people who bought in as BoxVR!  Shady‚Ä¶."
501,ekai,Aug 5 at 12:56 AM,2,Buggy AF,App environment freezes often during game play about 80% of the time. When this happens there is a faint circle of visual static that you can see but controls don't work and nothing is moving in the environment.  You have to force quit the app and any workouts during this time are not saved.  I deleted and unsubscribed after the 6th attempt. Not worth the time or money.
502,Tcheri55,Jul 25 at 7:58 PM,5,workout,I love it   this is a great new way to get up and moving

505,Hot-peppper,Oct 2 at 6:59 PM,3,how to set up subscription?,not able to do it
506,Frost,Jun 22 at 5:41 AM,2,This is ridiculous,I liked the app so I started the trial assuming that the monthly subscription would be charged after the trial ended. Well it turns out they charge for the full year instead without any way to cancel it I had no problem paying the monthly payment until I decided to keep or not and now I‚Äôm stuck paying the full year because there is no way to change it. It‚Äôs very unfortunate because I did like it for the most part but not enough to pay that much for it
507,DarylMarcel,"May 17, 2022 at 6:05 PM",5,Love FitXR,"I love FitXR.  It has fun and exciting workouts. I love the boxing and it kicks my butt. I do the dancing with a group of friends.

This app lets you workout the entire body and you end up sweating a lot. I totally recommend it as you have lots of fun while training. Now they also included warm up and cool down sessions.
513,VTRok,Jun 14 at 10:57 PM,5,Very well!!!,"Done very well, very useful for playing sports and losing weight. But until the problem I reported is solved, I will keep a star. When you activate the class the left hand is completely out of phase. Already written by e-mail but nothing.

516,Cis829,Jun 16 at 7:12 AM,5,"Better feedback, easier interface","I prefer this app to Supernatural. I like the feedback sounds and vibrations - makes me feel like I'm actually hitting something. You probably won't know the artists the music is from, but things still have a good beat. Most of all, I like the class variety."
517,Natlight,Jun 21 at 12:46 AM,1,Bait and Switch,I bought this specifically because it was a one time purchase fitness game. They changed it to a monthly subscription and abandoned all the users who paid full price for the game. Terrible business practice. Who knows what they will do next?

521,dew070665,Aug 1 at 4:17 PM,1,The reason I bought the Meta Quest,"Borrowed an Oculus from a friend and tried the Fitxr. It was a free program that you could subscribe to if you wanted. I finally saved enough money to buy the Meta Quest only to find that it is now a subscription. Very disappointed that I even bought the unit. Guess I can still return it. Why do you have to ruin a good thing. I may have even subscribed the more I got into it, but will not subscribe not knowing. Thanks for nothing."
522,David HK,"Apr 5, 2022 at 5:26 AM",3,Using the 7 Day trial,"I am also a supernatural user which is a top notch fitness app. I guess fit XR is pretty good for the price. Definitely an intense workout and it has a multiplayer kind of feel as you can see who is also playing as you compete on the leaderboard. What I don't like off the bat is that when trying out the boxing sessions the targets are not properly synced with the beat. You need someone who knows about music and syncopation to properly time them as supernatural does. Also it seems that the targets don't detect every hit. Also the workouts show the genre of music but not the names of the actual tracks.  I also heard that this used to be a one time purchase which became a subscription which angered a lot of users. But I get that though since you have to pay the people who are constantly licensing the music and creating new content for the game. Perhaps you can provide an option for a one time purchase then add an option to buy new workout packs as they come out.  I'll keep updating as I explore the app further.
Update***Defintely not going past the 7 day trial
If there was an option of a one time purchase with add on packs I would happy to oblige but when doing the math, there's really no value over time"
523,BenderNZ,Sep 12 at 12:00 PM,3,Not for me,"Not engaging enough and makes me feels sick! Lol, great graphics though"
524,Leonard Anderson,Jun 23 at 10:39 AM,5,Best workout app thus far!,"Love this app, use it almost everyday. The warm-up and cool down tracks are a nice touch. Best thing overall this app is always improving and updating."

526,Alex,"Apr 20, 2022 at 6:32 PM",5,Great workouts!,"Writing this to support an entire FitXR team as I truly believe current rating is unfair. The highlights of the app are workouts - I have both FitXR and Supernatural and I started with the latter. Hands down FitXR is a much better workout app that makes you work hard even at the beginner level. In Supernatural I don't understand Flow at all and have been doing Box mostly. Box in FitXR is lot more informative - you have stats during class, you have others to compete with, you have post-workout report to check your progress and this is one of the best features in the app. HIIT is as informative as Box and same great workout. Just to give an example I wasn't able to make progress in Supernatural in Box after some point, but after doing several days of Box in FitXR I got better results in Supernatural as well. Also boxing in FitXR is harder and not as easy as in Supernatural since the latter is more forgiving.

Overall, great workout app if you need results and like stats."
527,Sunique,"May 13, 2022 at 6:41 PM",1,Disappointed,"I did the trial period. Decided I like it and wanted the membership. I thought it would be a monthly fee.  But they took the whole amount for the year. Which I was NOT expecting.  I‚Äôve attempted to contact support regarding this. With no luck.  Very disappointed in how I am not able to contact anyone to resolve this. I will not be renewing.  The way they present the price with the trial is misleading. It‚Äôs showed a $ amount, then the monthly amount right below it. I thought, the monthly amount would be what I would be paying. I was NOT prepared for them to take $92 out of my checking account"
528,Lisa,Jul 2 at 3:35 AM,5,Boxing is a great workout.,I love the boxing. A 15 minute workout really makes me sweat even in beginner mode. The subscription price is pretty reasonable too.
529,Chad,Jul 20 at 12:55 AM,1,I wanted to like it. I really did‚Ä¶,"I wanted to like this app, and at first I did‚Ä¶ I guess. It got me sweating and I really liked the HIIT after I tried it a few times. However, the generic voice over was, after a while, like nails on a chalkboard. I hate the people who put these together and talk. It doesn‚Äôt hype you up, it brings you down. So I turned that off.

Competing with others is the most distracting thing I‚Äôve ever done. Turned that off. 

The sub model is gross and probably the number one reason I‚Äôm rating it 1 Star and cancelling the sub. I‚Äôve been using this for 7 months now and honestly, I don‚Äôt see enough new stuff here to make it worth the money I spent. It‚Äôs all about the greed now with these subscriptions. 

Supernatural is also garbage, I‚Äôd rather just buy beat saber. 

I‚Äôm using Les Mills now, hopefully they keep it real. Put out new content that costs a little bit, but isn‚Äôt breaking the bank. It‚Äôs not that hard to sync a song to some punch prompts and add a voiceover that was recorded long before this app was released. You know they recycle that‚Ä¶ right‚Ä¶"
530,moranbar,Jun 24 at 9:54 AM,5,Loving it,"A great workout for the days when you cannot hit the gym. 7-30 min of boxing, makes my body wake up! Great music and a very motivational instructors"

535,YEETBEARTX,Jul 26 at 11:51 PM,1,Bad gameplay and spam,As seen from in game it seems like a beat saber ripped version.I would choose to play beat saber because of its qualities.And it also is constantly asking you to spend money on the game from the game store.It‚Äôs is not a well thought game and it probably could be better.Also leveling just does not work well.I would not recommend this terrible game.I would choose lift boxer or thrill of the fight if you want a good boxing game.And if you want a color smashing game I would choose beat saber.

Someone from admin emailed me personally to point out that these are squats and that it wasn't sensing my squats so it wasn't letting me continue.  I did a leg HIIT workout today and did it correctly.   It worked and it was an awesome leg workout!  I apologize to Fitxr and would recommend Fitxr for a well balanced workout system!

I am all for owning up to missing things when I do. But when even the gauge shows I hit it harder than the previous hits and it registers as a weak hit and does this multiple times in a round, I get frustrated.

557,Ldorothy32,"Mar 23, 2022 at 1:00 AM",5,Love this app,As a middle aged woman I had stopped working out especially since 2020. Since getting the app FitXR I now work out!  My body has more energy and I feel good.  I work out 5 out of 7 days minimum. I can see the difference in my stance and I feel good. I‚Äôve been repeatedly doing the Hip Hip genre which is fun but pushes you. If you want to bring your body back to life while having fun then this app is for you!
558,Autumn,Jun 12 at 4:26 AM,2,So bad...,"Ugh I hate this app. The coaches are all avatars! Someone did the voices, so why not have them also do the workouts? The music also sucks. It's nothing I've ever hears before. I also hate being on a score board. I just want to workout, not compete with a bunch of crummy auto-generated pseudo-avatars of other people doing the same thing. They are distracting, and look terrible anyway: just a bunch of pale green headset faces and disarticulated hands. 

The workout are boring. All you do is copy the coach avatar. I keep trying to get into it, but it's awful."

569,Aariny,Jun 15 at 4:42 AM,3,Experiencing the Updated,"6/14/22 - increased from one star to three

I‚Äôm still upset they changed from a purchased app to a pay model. I have actually refrained from purchasing other apps knowing there is nothing stoping developers from doing the same. So I guess you could say I still am lacking trust.

However, I logged in today (as I have done periodically) and have noticed improvements in the app. It was easy to find a free workout. There are warm ups and cool downs. The music and coaching is so much better. I also remembered how much I love working out this way! It is enough that I plan on putting FitXR back in my workout plan for a bit to see how it goes. 

I‚Äôm all for supporting developers. I have no problem buying add ons in apps (at least ones that I trust) - but I think monthly subscriptions are waisting money. I‚Äôll see how it goes and update from there. 

Also, I hope that the pride area stays past June. I love it so much. 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Like others I paid for one thing and then they completely changed it and want me to pay a monthly fee. It is so different they should have created an entirely new app. Also, to find what you paid for takes way to much searching and clicking through messages trying to get you to subscribe. And you have to do it every single time you open the app. I wish they were forced to refund us all.

Edit: Hey - you want me to update my review? Here you go - I was made aware of it. I addressed it in my review above. Apparently you didn't read it so I will say it again. The content may still be there (although full functionality is not) but you have made it as hard to get to as possible and placed it behind pop ups to subscribe. See my actual review. Also, maybe instead of telling all the reviewers we are wrong - you should listen to us? I have reached out to Oculus to see if there is a chance of a refund. I'm not in the UK so I may have to deal with being SCAMMED."
570,SpottedTrunkfish,Jun 15 at 4:30 AM,3,"Great App, But‚Ä¶Details and Polish Needed","I literally use this app 3-4 times a week, but lots of lingering usability and productivity issues reduce  its effectiveness. 

1. Descriptions Out Of Sync - Many class times do not match with the description. While many are just one minute off, the time in the description for ‚ÄúLow to Get High‚Äù is 14 minutes and the bulleted time is 17 minutes. For ‚ÄúTarget Practice‚Äù, the bullets show 15 minutes and the description shows 18. The ‚ÄúPower Punch‚Äù bulleted time shows 15 minutes and a whopping 30 minutes in the description. The only way to be sure how long these classes are is to take them. 

2. Stats? - Stats have been reformatted several times and the latest Achievements organization is the least useful. You can only see the current day‚Äôs stat total and have to manually total previous day‚Äôs stats by scrolling through (and mousing over) every previous class. I am not sure how many people find a rolling 7- and 30-day total helpful; but showing a graph and/or table with daily totals would be much more useful for those using this to track progress. 

3. Sorting - While the general filters like time (short, medium, long) are nice, the classes are not sorted and it takes time to scroll through pages and pages of classes to find, say, the 15-minute classes. The ability to sort by time would make it much easier to see all the options that fit a user‚Äôs time window. 

4. Filtering Seated Classes - Consider adding a filter for seated classes. Standing users would save time by not having to scroll through seated classes and vice-versa. 

5. Remembering Status - After every completed class, users have to deselect the studio, difficulty, duration, environment, etc. It would be very helpful and save a lot of time to keep those selections‚Ä¶or add an option in Settings to Save classes filter selections. 

6. Fault Tolerance - When/if the headset losses it‚Äôs Internet connection, the app does not save the score for the class you are currently in and requires a app restart in order to select another class. Consider writing the final class score to memory and save it when the Internet connection is restored and try to proactively restore the connection on the fly without the user having to exit/re-enter. 

7. App Rating Modal - While there is a checkbox to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ask Again‚Äù on the app rating request pop-up, it doesn‚Äôt appear to work as I have selected it many times and it still pops up. 

8.  Exit Button - Consider adding an exit button. Forcing and exit through the Oculus menu button is a bit inelegant."

588,Brian,"Mar 15, 2022 at 6:20 AM",5,Boxing workouts have been fixed!,"[PROS]

- It is a good workout and it works your legs
- Punch detection in boxing workouts now work as expected
- Music selection is good
- Workout selection is good
- FIIT mode is awesome
- Multiplayer is an awesome idea * It makes this game really competitive and addictive. It makes a fun workout game even more fun. Yes, Steam's Box VR has this too, but no one on Steam plays this game in multiplayer.
- Punch tracking has greatly improved 

[OK]

- Subscription price is very reasonable. It is way cheaper than Supernatural.
- Not a fan of Dance mode, but some people may like it.

[CONS]


- Cheating is starting to be a problem in HIIT workouts. The most common way people do it is by artificially reducing their height, making the distance between blocks small enough to have an edge. I don't understand why they do this but maybe removing the trial users from my games would fix this? There are other ways people cheat, but I won't mention it here.

- Some HIIT if workouts just have block distances wrong. They are two close together so that you don't need to move as directed by the fitness instructor.

UPDATE: I will contact support, but I'm going to respond here for now.
- ""Windmilling"" can be prevented by shielding the targets. 
- Certain cheating can also be prevented if you ensure the headset is facing forward for certain games, and not backwards.
- Maybe being able to block offending players could be a feature? It's not a priority for me yet, since this isn't as wide spread for now."

No tutorial video with boxing and I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get consistency with hitting the targets. Dance had a video and was ok, but I don‚Äôt like dance (Supernatural does NOT have this). I like the real videos of the trainers in Supernatural as compared to the bad CGI that is in FitXr. Supernatural has a thing called flow, boxing, and meditation. Think I‚Äôm sticking with that.

More annoying still is that one of my controllers often disconnects during the box classes, causing me to be distracted and miss a bunch. Doesn't happen in any other app or other classes, so it is this app for sure.

On Fit, I can't find any music that I enjoy, regardless of the genre. The workouts are difficult, with very minimal instruction.  I just couldn't jump in and start making progress like I could in Supernatural...so it felt very defeating. I like the real-time competition, but due to the lack of instruction, I was always dropping to the end of the pack - which is pretty defeating.  Plus most likely I was competing with those 1/2 my age or less.  The Avatar trainers are not for me - I must prefer the Supernatural Crew.

I saw plenty of reviews of Les Mills Body Combat, so tried that for a week. Music is poor (IMO) and the workouts are limited.

Have carried on my workouts on FitXR and am more than happy paying monthly for a quality piece of software that helps me get fit and is so enjoyable.

Lots of updates on a regular basis and can't praise it enough.

Well done!"

631,Dan,"May 4, 2022 at 1:24 AM",2,Good app destroyed by crazy price policy,"This is a very good fitness app that unfortunately suffers from a crazy subscription model that makes it extremely expensive to use compared to all other apps for the Oculus Quest. 
I have used FitXR for intense workouts every two or three days ever since it was released as BoxVR and I have really like it. Its very efficient. The boxing is good and the Hiit workouts gets me up to heart rate level 5 just as a Hiit workout should. Back when you could buy extra workouts as DLC I happily did so. When the subscription model was introduced (in a surprisingly clumsy way that alienated many users), I did not complain or protest by lowering my rating to 1, as so many others did. I just paid up and kept working out. 

I do understand the temptation to use a subscription model. The workouts in FitXR are so efficient that many users, including me, really can save money by canceling their gym card. Since the app is cheaper than most gym cards you could argue that the price is ok. I accepted this logic. However, the release of LesMills Body Combat has made me think again. LesMills is sold as a regular app that you pay for once.  It only contains boxing, no Hiit or dance, but what it does it does much better than FitXR. The workouts in FitXR looks and feels crude by camparison. This made me realize that the company behind FitXR are selling a rather primitive product at a outrageous price. As long as there were no competition I accepted to pay ever month. I simply needed a functioning workout app. But now there is finaly strong competition and after using LesMills for a few weeks I decided to cancel my subscription to FitXR ans lowered my rating to 2. For variation I will continue to use FitXR with the old DLC packages that I have paid for. But from now on my main workout app is LesMills since it works better than FitXR at a much better price.
I really hope that FitXR will go back to selling the app in the normal way, and offer DLC:s. Then they would get me back as a customer."

633,Mike,"Jan 16, 2022 at 6:26 PM",3,OK but better options out there,"This is an entertaining workout that gets you sweating.  The movements are easy to follow and there are enough variety to keep you busy.

The problem is that Supernatural does it better, especially now that they offer boxing as well.  fitXR only has a couple of scenes/places to work out, and they are all fictional.  In supernatural you're in a beautiful 360 degree place - the moon, mars, salt flats of Utah, Beach of South Africa, temples in Egypt, hot springs in Iceland, and so many other places.  

FitXR has mostly avatars for training and form, supernatural is always a live person.  They both provide standard instructions during the workout.  Where FitXR lacks is that you just start a workout at full pace, Supernatural has a slight warmup and cool down intro/exit, as well as instructor lead stretching.

Music - FitXR is generic songs, you won't sing along to anything or be able to anticipate a beat.  Supernatural has a very broad range of hit music - Country, pop, rock, hip-hop, classical!  You do not get to chose your song for either.  

The bit detection in FitXR is really good, I find it better than Supernatural, and the pace is typically easier to follow in proper form, I get out of sync in SN more often but I know what I'm doing in FitXR at all times.  One reason is that FitXR is always in the same direction, SN has you turning left and right as well, definitely more movements.  

FitXR is a better price for sure, so try the free trials to see which one you like more, I choose SN, but will see if FitXR is able to upgrade their platform in few months."

 I love the colors, and getting to pick my own workout space. That's where the good stuff ended for me.
This is entirely too slow, easy, and boring. I never got my heart rate up at all, and never broke a sweat.

At least half the time I got ghost hits. My hands just went right through the targets without breaking them. This might not matter to others, but it frustrated the heck out of me. I expect to explode the target, not just go through it. 

Foe me, this was nothing but a small amount of arm movements. I need fast and furious ful body exercise.  

The avatar coaches didn't bother me, but those 'other people' beside me did. Fake or real, I don't know, but I can honestly say it bugged me to be able to see them in my side eye.

I may come back at a later date and try again, but for now, this just isn't what I need every day."
653,greiver,"Mar 3, 2022 at 4:04 AM",5,Great for working out at home,"My son purchased a 1 year subscription for this one night when i wasn't paying attention and it cost $120 CAD. I was a bit upset at first but I figured I  might as well use it because I haven't been very active lately.

After about a week of use I can say I will probably get another subscription when this one is up. The workouts are rewarding and really make me sweat. I can feel the burn in my muscles the next day as well.

The coaches urging you on throughout the workout are really helpful, giving you pointers and technical tips to make sure you are using good form. Additionally it's really motivating to have a coach push you and urge you to finish strong. I've tried a couple different coaches, but I really like Zion, the guys is extremely inspirational if you're familiar with him on YouTube. It really is easy to get into the workouts with someone like that pushing you to your limits.

I hope to see more workout options from Zion in the future."

It was a bit frustrating though that there was no way to filter the ones you had no vs the ones you didn't. I bring you to my discovery upon logging in for the first time in a while. They have stripped my game down to where I have access to almost none of the songs I had when I PAID FOR THE GAME (just to make sure you remember) Nor the ADDITIONAL song pack that I PURCHASED also before a subscription service was offered.

The thing I really like about this app is the scoring method. You can see right away the power on each punch. I liked that. I can see immediately if I am stronger with my left jab or right jab whereas Supernatural just gives you a final score at the end of each song and then a total score at the end of each workout. So that was better with this app. 

The cons‚Ä¶.. the music is awful and most often doesn‚Äôt even sync with the workout. The punches don‚Äôt go with the best of the music. Pop music tended to be more hip hop. Rock was heavy metal. The coaches don‚Äôt do anything at all. Once or twice in a song they say something stupid like ‚Äúgood one‚Äù or ‚Äúkeep it going‚Äù and there is no warm up. 

All in all the cons far out way the one pro. I‚Äôm cancelling my 7 day free trial. It‚Äôs not for me."

The game is about fitness, but 'missing' punches is hella discouraging and just throws me out of my groove.

Update: Since playing again after over a year the hit detection is much better. There are still flaws though. Requiring a certain speed/power threshold and taking away your streak is really discouraging. I'm fine with harder punches getting higher score, what I am not okay with his hitting a note and the game removing my incentive to keep going while tired.
The tempo is awful. Who just throws out crosses and jabs rapid-fire. There is no way to get back to a neutral pose so I just end up flailing trying to keep hitting notes. Two crosses should never be back to back, and there needs to be a cooldown period after a cross to get back to neutral."

Buuut there is muche work to do to be worth the 10$ Abo.

Boxing: at first plz Change the pause Button, its anoing how often you hit the pause Button while playing.
The high of the punching balls are to low you dont aim in shoulder hight in Boxing. The hit count is also meh you dont need muche effort to get 10 point hooks, to get 10 point punches its way harder. Also if you go on Expert the balls are so close together you often cant see the next punch. Also there are no cross punches.

The classes feel weird  are the classmates fake? Why is there no Interaktion ? Same for the leaderboard ... are this the bots..iam competite is it the World Board?  ..so as i wrote this all dont bring me in competive mode.

676,bobvinyl,"Apr 28, 2022 at 1:21 PM",3,"Good workout, but bad training","I mostly focus on boxing and the workout is good and has enough variety to stay interesting. The big problem is that the way the cues come teaches you to punch incorrectly. For example, headd shots would always land the the right or left of the opponent's head. If the cues moved around (like Beat Saber), that would be okay as it would simulate a moving opponent, these cues do not do that. They just build muscle memory to punch to the wrong spot. I know this is not self-defense or martial arts training, but it should not encourage bad technique nonetheless."

Previous:
FitXR has gone from nearly 5 Stars to 2.9.  By now you know about the bait and switch FitXR pulled on its users. They did it twice already and will do it again. DON‚ÄôT LET THEM SCAM YOU. 

There‚Äôs no need for you to pay a subscription for a glitchy game with awful music from an untrustworthy developer when there are now plenty of subscription free fitness/boxing games on the Quest. 
 
PowerbeatsVR and X-Booster are great alternatives. They both let you use your own music to generate workouts. Powerbeatsvr and X-Booster give you FitXR style boxing without the $10/month subscription fee. 


******
Previous review: 

FitXR used to be great, now it‚Äôs just an epic failure on so many levels.  Developer uses scummy tactics to trick you out of your money. 

X-Booster is now my go to game for fitness. No monthly sub and you can use your own music to generate beat maps. Thrill of the Fight, Synth Riders, Audio Trip,  Oh Shape, Song Beater, Pistol Whip, Knockout League, PowerbeatsVR, Dance Central and Hitstream are also great fitness games that don‚Äôt require a monthly fee to play. 

This developer has a history of using bait and switch tactics to sell their app (remember BoxVR?). Now they suddenly change to a greedy subscription model without giving existing users any prior notice!

They want people to pay $10 a month, $120 per year, for ‚Äúone new (crappy repetitive and uninspiring) workout a day‚Äù. If you end your subscription, you LOSE access to those workouts. The game doesn‚Äôt even work half of the time. 


Now to the actual game content. The boxing part of the game is just ok. Think Beat Saber but with suckier music, a lower frame rate, and stuttering gameplay.   The new workouts that they want you to pay $10 a month for are basically just computer generated beat maps with awful, unrecognizable music,  with the so called instructor saying ""new points level"" every 30 seconds. The moves don‚Äôt sync with the music very well. Also, There's no real instruction. 
There‚Äôs no warm up or cool down. 

The ‚Äúdance studio‚Äù is atrocious. Like, it‚Äôs so so so bad that it‚Äôs sad. It‚Äôs just a weird, janky looking CGI trainer with annoying voiceovers. Looks like something a 6th grader would create in an intro to game development class. I have second hand embarrassment for FitXR for putting out that hot garbage and thinking people would want to pay $10 a month for it.

Tried HIIT and it wasn‚Äôt fun at all. Same poorly animated trainer as the janky dance studio. Requires a  lot of space. A lot of my punches did not register correctly. I quit halfway through because the commentary annoyed me so much. Definitely not worth paying $10 monthly. 


Multiplayer - your friends will need to pay for a subscription too. But if you're a real friend you'd tell your friend to stay away from this app. There‚Äôs no server based public multiplayer rooms like with other VR games. You have to have a code. If you want to find someone to play with, you have to take off your headset, get on Facebook, and find a code or share your code. It‚Äôs tedious and sucks the fun out of it. 

THEY REMOVED THE ABILITY TO PLAY OFFLINE. If you travel a lot and/or don‚Äôt have access to a high speed internet connection, you cannot play this game. 

They make a lot of promises to fix the bugs,  but the developer is so disingenuous that you can‚Äôt trust anything they say. I have lost faith in FitXR. Stay away from this app."

Original review:
Pay me back for the game and DLC.  What you did was wrong on so many levels.
I gave it three stars a long time ago.  But with the new update, I have to say that you have failed.  Because apart from the fact that it takes an eternity to start, it also takes an eternity to start the different sections in the game.  I bought the game do not want anything that costs me month to month.  I do not even want to try that part.  But do I get an alternative NO.  Am very unsure if I now when I start it again if I have to pay or not.  I regret that I bought this game from the beginning.
I think you have done wrong to us who have bought games to do as you did. Pay back the money to us who bought it. 
 Build a new game instead.
GIVE BACK MY MONEY.

Response from the developer:
Hey there John, As you bought the standalone version of the app, you definitely don't need to sign up for any sort of membership. You'll have access to all of the original content you purchased, plus new updates and additional free classes that we've added over the last few months - so a minimum of around 65 free classes, maybe more depending on when you made your original purchase. If you're having trouble accessing that, or need help navigating the newer Home View menus, please do reach out on support@fitxr.com and we'll look into that for you. - Tom, FitXR"

692,potatjo,"Jan 15, 2022 at 12:42 PM",5,I‚Äôve tried every fitness-y app now,"So I had mob mentality and liked Supernatural because of the high ratings, and the cool surroundings and views during the trial but noticed I hadn‚Äôt touched it in 4 days because I‚Äôve been playing Thrill of The Fight, Beat Saber and Synth Riders to workout. I also noticed Supernatural didn‚Äôt have any actual scores, personalization or a calorie counter. My trial ended and decided to give FitXR a try. I decided not to listen to bad reviews because a lot of them were angry because of the new subscription. 

I felt it was off putting because in one of the dance class intro videos there was a sickly thin guy with no muscle tone showing us that he‚Äôs playing the game with dance moves. *eye roll* we don‚Äôt wanna look like that, we wanna look healthy and toned, not sickly and rail thin but whatever. 

Came back to it later to give it another try before uninstalling it. Holy crap I love this more than Supernatural now because I can track my calories, have actual high scores, and best of all compete with other people WHILE I workout lol I am VERY competitive so this made me try harder than if I were alone and bored. I am going to use this every day I am not sore! 


However, I wish there were more avatars (female ones), a playlist option, the option to add our own songs somehow, more environments (maybe ones in space, the beach or the mountains). But this is ok for now because I‚Äôm trying to find something that gets me moving daily instead of just every few days."

694,jarby,"Feb 14, 2022 at 9:35 PM",5,Its not as bad as reviews say at all!,"To be honest, i was afraid by all bad reviews out there, but decided to try 7 day trial, and you know what - im glad i did.  The game is really good  fitness game, i mean you move a lot , its fun , and instructors are great.  Yes it is not BOXVR, BOXVR vs this GAME is like single player vs MMO.  New game has a lot of nice improvements and features i liked (i move much more than in BOXVR,)  and  IMHO is  totally worth paying.  P.S. Gave it 4 not 5 only because im still new and didnt explore all possibilities yet.  Good Job! , hope you will continue to develop it

 Dev's!! create a new game but don't change a game into subscription for the people that supported you from the beginning.. I don't want free months to make up for it I want my base game and dlc back.. or give me my 60bucks back I spent on this game.. I will be contacting oculus/meta about this.. I definitely think other veterans should do the same..

If you are worried about why the old users are giving it a bad score, it was bc the app changed from a 1 time payment to a subscription model. Honestly, I don‚Äôt care. I do prefer a subscription model with weekly updates (which they do) than 1 time payment dead game/app.

Do yourself a favor and try the HIIT mode. It is fantastic and the best VR workout I ever had."

The top right corner was at the same height as my ear and the bottom left was at chest height.

I would recommend doing a warmup and a cool down before and after. I usually use SynthRider to do that. Aside from the cardio, the boxing ones are the real killers. I‚Äôm like drenched in sweat and I burn so much during them. 10/10 would recommend even just the free version. If you think it‚Äôs getting too easy, you can wear resistance bands or body weights!"

Otherwise, it needs tweaking . i can't do full squats or lunges, but it doesn't give me the option to leave out or adjust them. the scenery is mediocre and im sure would get boring after any amount of time since there's only 6 or 7 scenes and they are computer generated not real places. The height is touchy since normally that would adjust your squats or lunges but it doesn't amd even with correct height the punch goals aren't where they should be. worst part... there is NO HOW TO for it! at the beginning of EVERY fitness thing, there is a general intro, here's what the targets look like, here's what you do, move this way, this means this, and so on...NOT HERE! it's just figured it out or don't, jump right in and guess. horribly poorly thought out. if i had guess i would say an athlete with all healthy friends came up with this because it definitely does not take complete beginners into consideration nor does it consider disabilities other than just completely immobile. i give it 3 stars because it is a workout and there's variety in the type so by that standard, it serves its purpose--just not to some other populations."

FitXR was the best workout on the Oculus Quest store. when they changed to a subscription-based service, they stopped adding more classes to previous owners, like HIIT class with just three free classes as like free users this means any new workout will same as a free user, I hope they're different from free users by adding more HIIT class like 10-15 same as dance class."

I know a lot of people don't like paying the subscription, and there are other free and paid apps out there, but FitXR is the one for me. And I work up a SWEAT. I love the boxing workouts best. 

I also love that right now (February 2022) they have special workouts as part of Black History Month. I just did a boxing routine that included information on House music, and that was pretty cool. I loved it. 

I miss my local gym, and I love supporting local businesses, but I had to stop going because of the pandemic. My FitXR subscription is less than half what I paid for my yearly gym membership, not to mention what I would have paid additionally for a trainer to keep me motivated.

726,Medimagery,"Feb 3, 2022 at 12:13 AM",5,I just tried the new FitXR,"July 30, 2020 - - I just tried the new updated ""FitXR"", which seems to have replaced my old BoxVR app in Quest. The app deserves 5 stars, and it is far more sophisticated than BoxVR. It's among the best workouts out there. And if you put extra effort in, it's the best. But I am already missing BoxVR, the environments of which I really loved (not to mention my saved songlists). Please bring BoxVR back as a retro option within FitXR, or sell it as a separate app.  In fact, while I enjoy the techy feel of FitXR, I also like the homey bright feeling of the old gyms. I even miss the old glove color options. BoxVR had especially well-designed environments, as it was, and those should be maintained. Also, please offer a few more environment settings (5) in the new version so the old favorites can be accessed as well as new. And offer the glove color options again, please. Having the ability to adjust the setting was a wonderful way to begin a workout, and offered an important sense of variety/fun. I am giving a 4 star review.

Update Feb 2, 2022 -- I returned today to check the reviews on this page, after 18 more months, and I add my reflections. First, I am sad to see this app is getting 3 stars. It doesn't deserve that. I do miss some features from the original game. But the developers are clearly working really hard to make this game great. And now the game has features better than the original had. Since beginning to play the original BoxVR in 2019, and being a fitness VR type user, this has been one of my top 5 go to games. I really love it. In recent updates I am blown away by the accuracy of the punches (compared to other VR fitness apps), I love the new dance options, too. I think they are better and more fun than Dance Central. I still miss some of the original music, and I miss the atmosphere of 2021's game, too. But I am willing to pay for in-app purchases to get song additions. Thank you to the developers for keeping up with this app. The app deserves 5 stars!!"
727,Chris Rustin,"Mar 31, 2022 at 6:25 AM",4,Hit Detection Makes It Unenjoyable,"It is very frustrating to be hitting the targets but constantly having your streak reset.  I‚Äôm assuming there is a speed or power requirement for a proper ‚Äúhit‚Äù, but that should just take points away.  Hearing the miss/reset noise over and over and see the streak go to 0 while hitting the target kills the enjoyment.  I will stick with the boxing in Supernatural.

**After trying out the different mode the game is more enjoyable.  Just note, the mode settings for streaks are not in the main settings menu, but in the individual classes menu.  I think this should probably be a global option as I never looked for a specific class settings menu."

732,Kamahu,"Dec 23, 2021 at 1:25 AM",3,Fun workouts but‚Ä¶,"The Fit XR team needs to do some major customer service. I‚Äôm new to the Oculus platform, but I bought my Quest 2 specifically because I wanted some fun workout options. Fit XR is SO MUCH FUN! I‚Äôve never WANTED to work out before. The workouts feel like a fun game but I‚Äôm always sweating by the end and my muscles are sore the next day. I‚Äôve been doing the free content for about 2 weeks and decided today that I would buy the subscription. They offer two plans: $6.99 a month billed yearly, or $9.99 a month billed monthly. However, the app will absolutely not allow me to start a monthly plan (the confirmation screen crashes), but if I choose the yearly plan it works fine (all the way up to entering my pin). I don‚Äôt want to commit to a whole year right now, and it seems deceptive that I only have that choice. On top of that, I‚Äôm seeing a lot of comments from people who bought the game previously, but are now being required to pay the fee as well. They should be grandfathered in or refunded their original amount. Until these customer service issues are resolved, I‚Äôll be trying the other boxing/fitness games.

Only leaving this review because the app bugged me every time I launched it and it wouldn't stop. So here's your review, and that annoying feature lost you a star."
734,Oldboy,"Mar 6, 2022 at 6:50 PM",4,Redeemed,"I was among the throng of many longtime users that excoriated this product when the executive staff of this company like so many other of their peers, decided to exploit the COVID crisis and try to force all users, new and old alike, into a subscription based model.  After their reputation had been dragged through the dirt and they capitulated a little bit to the original customer base, what remained for non-subscription holdouts was a pitiful, disorganized shadow of the previous product.  I did not use it at all for many months.

In the last few months however, following many revisions and the introduction of a sensible menu structure and also a sufficient variety of workouts for non-subscription users, I have returned to the use of this application on a regular basis.  Once more, I find it engaging and a very useful supplemental workout tool.  In my opinion this company has adequately redeemed itself to it‚Äôs longtime user base.

I do offer one suggestion however:  Standing at 6‚Äô2‚Äù, I find that the arm length that the program is designed for is far less than optimal for a person of my reach.  In order to be in sync with the targets and achieve reasonable arm extension, I have to stand just behind the foot circle.  This causes the program to regularly illicit annoying warning chimes and distracting messages.  I would either like to see a control for adjusting the program for arm length or at the very least, a control for disabling the warning chimes and messages.  I might add that it is obvious that many of the workouts were designed by individuals of shorter stature and reach.  Although I fare well in most of the workouts, I note that in particular, during the Advanced boxing workouts that there are commonly instances where a person of my reach cannot reset their punches fast enough and/or your punches would have to be short, powerless, and ineffective to hit every target.  I don‚Äôt want to get into bad habits, so I just let a few of the targets go by, which is not as motivating."

742,RavenOne,"Feb 9, 2022 at 4:17 PM",1,How not to box - misleading app,"I checked my account and I did the 1 month subscription for $9.99. It had tons of classes, as well as special daily classes, only a few of them I liked.  Most often speed is the focus instead of proper form, punching air 4 times/second is not doing yourself any favors.  Some players will experience shoulder issues. 

Here comes the boom.

After the 7 day trial is over, or you quit the subscription the app is gutted and you are left with 9 classes. 3 Boxing, 3 Cardio Hiit, and 3 dance classes(which are very bad). 

As a fitness application VR in general is poor.  Perhaps if there were more trackers on your feet, knees, elbows, waist and chest it will get better.  The largest muscles in the body are the legs and the only move VR has is squats.  Most other cardio workouts that are home based have a better instructor, pace and movement dynamics. 

After using this for over a month I've quit the membership. I find myself doing fast little rabbit punches which isn't good for anything. It does get your heart rate up but any Beach Body workout will crush this app side by side. 

Perhaps in a few years with additional hardware and a heart rate tracker on screen VR fitness can really take off. Until that time most people will unknowingly regress to poor form in order to register hits on this game."

I have been playing this game for almost 4 years.  I bought the Quest, Oculus desktop, and Steam version.  I have bought this game 3 different times so I can play it on any VR system I want.  And I can't recommend it for someone looking for a casual workout.  Understand that this game does have issues.  I continue to play it 4 years later because it is the best exercise tool when it's working properly.  But with every update they seem to care less about the workout portion and more about getting as many people as possible to buy it by turning it into a boxing, dancing, and HIIT trainer while constantly bragging about how inclusive it is."

758,HolmesJD,"Dec 12, 2021 at 12:23 PM",3,Not as good as it used to be...,"I bought this game when it was just boxing and dancing.  I love Thrill of the Fight and thought I would enjoy another boxing game.  I didn‚Äôt enjoy the dancing part (just not my thing) so I really don‚Äôt play that.

Pro: It is a great workout that always made me sweat.  I couldn‚Äôt play the longer workouts because my headset would get slippery or fogged up.  

Cons: It can get a bit repetitive.  You had to hit really hard to get it to count towards your streak.  I didn‚Äôt mind losing my streak when I missed, but it was disappointing to hit it and it not count.  I found my tendonitis flaring up in my elbow after playing from trying to hit so hard (a problem I don‚Äôt have with Thrill of the Flight despite swinging so hard to knock the guy out).  I think it is because the motions are repetitive.  

I would give the game 4 stars if it was still the way it was when I bought it.  

When the update came out with the HIIT component, I really enjoyed it, but recognized that it was just a free trial.  It wasn‚Äôt part of the package that I purchased so I wasn‚Äôt really disappointed that I didn‚Äôt get to keep that content (except the very basic samples).  No deducted stars for that.

However, when they switched it to a subscription plan where they regularly drop new workouts, it changed how the game functions.  I find it extremely frustrating to open the game and have to scroll through loads of locked workouts to find one I can play.  It seems like there are less choices than there used to be.  

I HATE these subscription plans.  As much as I enjoyed the HIIT workout, I would have gladly purchased an updated app (FitXR 2: HIIT) or paid for the new content within the original game.  I will not pay a monthly subscription as it is nowhere near worth that!"
759,Lucas Lacerda,"Feb 3, 2022 at 6:26 PM",3,Bait and switch (read the UPDATE below),"EDIT: Updating my review to address recent changes. I'm changing the score from 1 to 3 stars. After many months of complaints and negative reviews which led their score to be lowered from 4+ to 3 stars, the FitXR team has admitted its mistake and poor communication during the business model transition. 

They sent emails to all Legacy users admitting they did the wrong thing, gave us all the legacy DLC packs for free and a bunch of new classes. Legacy users are also entitled to receive 1 free class per month. The new HIIT classes are a great addition to this app and they feel like a real workout. 

It will take me a while to regain trust on this company, but they made the right thing even if too late. FitXR is still the amazing game it always was, I'm just not sure when the next big disappointment will come. Hopefully they've learned their lessons and will proper communicate with the user base before drastically changing what people paid for.

------

DON'T TRUST THIS DEVELOPER. Let me explain why. 

I want to start by saying that I was a long-time supporter of FitXR. I originally purchased this app as BoxVR back in 2019. I've recommended this game to many friends and even convinced some to get an Oculus Quest for it. Unfortunately, I can't support the dishonest practices this developer has repeatedly done anymore. 

When BoxVR switched to FitXR, many features were removed (environments, custom playlists, offline play) and we were promised they would return. A couple updates later, I started to love this new game. 

Less than a year later, the developer decided its time to revamp the game again. This time, introducing a subscription model. Contrary to what the developers are saying in other reviews, THIS SUBSCRIPTION IS NOT OPTIONAL. You can't say something is ""optional"" and remove every alternative to it. They delisted all the DLCs ($10 each) and base game ($30) - you DON'T have the option to choose. Today's, there's no other way to access these contents without paying a subscription. 

Imagine you bought a red car (BoxVR), the manufacturer decided to change it changed it to blue (FitXR). Sure, the new color started growing on you and a couple months later, when you finally got used to it, you now have to pay a subscription to use your car. Sure, they'll still allow you to drive to places you had already visited in the past but if you want to drive to a new place, you must pay this monthly fee. This is what this developer is trying to force you into. IT IS NOT OPTIONAL if are removing the alternatives. 

They mentioned this change happened because they wanted to provide better value to their customers, as there were many requests of frequent updates. However, when you paid $10 for 4 workouts before, you kept them FOREVER. In this new model, you get 30 monthly workouts for $10, however, as soon as you stop paying, YOU LOSE ACCESS TO ALL OF THEM. 

To make things worse, all of this was done without ANY NOTICE to their users. Instead, the only thing we got were teasers on social media about a big update. We were never told the business model would change.  If the developer had sent a message to their customers saying ""Hey, we're introducing a new subscription next week. We'll be delisting DLCs and you'll only be able to access what you has already purchased by that date"", things would've been much better. They didn't. 

As a response to the enormous backlash this developer is facing, they keep responding to reviews with copy and pasted lies such as ""membership is optional"" (it's not, alternatives are gone) and ""you get 30 workouts instead of 4 for $10"" (except you don't keep them if you stop paying).

That's it. This is a classic BAIT AND SWITCH approach, where they build a great product with excellent reputation, replace it by something else and hope that people won't notice the old 5 star reviews are referring to an old product that no longer exists.

Subscriptions are about trust of delivering great content. This developer is definitely capable of making great content, but they can't be trusted. Their history is a clear example of why you shouldn't trust them with your $120/year.

Would you invest your money in a company with this untrustworthy history? There's absolutely no guarantee they'll keep their word this time, as they already betrayed their users TWICE in less than a year. There's simply no guarantee they won't simply remove this game or its main features 6 months from now."

It was a good fit game before but now to go on the sub model is disappointing really disappointing... 
i would rather buy the content One Time Purchase rather than sub model. 
-> People dont fall into sub games!

What a stup*d business decision.

Offer OTP options for the contents than you get more stars and edited review. (I dont mind if i cant play ""multiplayer"" but i dont spend on sub models where a sub model is just stupid)

Edit: my recommendation is going the 50/50 route 
50-OTP/50-SUB  
Still offering OTP dlc‚Äôs for modes and workouts
But also the option for subscription all access and all premium online features. But changing it from payed game and otp dlcs to fully sub is really not a good move ‚Ä¶ (and the 90days trial for existing user is not a good excuse)

Edit2 response to the response: 
How about the people that bought it closely to the change or just wanted to start buying dlc‚Äòs ? Many people bought the game because of preplanned investment to the dlc packs but now ? Sry the answer you can use the packs that you allready bought is ‚Ä¶.. change it to 50/50 thats the only positive option for all."

Even after paying for the game, there's almost no content without a subscription (just 1 of each type and difficulty)... it's basically useless.  I just end up playing BoxVR on my PC instead.  Why not give people non-instructor content like BoxVR for non-subscribers and instructor led content for people that want to pay a subscription for that?  Then you wouldn't frustrate half your users.  It doesn't have to be all a money grab... you're just losing a lot of customers and probably doing financially worse than you would have been if you just made a great game.  I'm personally not buying any DLC for BoxVR because I don't want to reward you with any more money.  Meanwhile I'm happy to give Beat Saber my money for music packs I like, love that game.

I've tried PowerBeatsVR, as other have mentioned, and it's got a lot more content and is pretty fun to play.  However, it's not quite a replacement for BoxVR for a simple rhythm workout.  Keep in simple and listen to your customers."

Precision is null, frame rate is low, sometimes it staggers, misses punches or even the punching boxes appear at gnomes height! The virtual controllers get so pissed because of all of this that sometimes they run away on their own will (I mean... for real!)

Lately I can't exercise almost at all between all the problems it is having with each update: subscription not working, workouts just disappearing from the environment, internet connection not detected... every update is a painful process that requires you to throw the headset and go for a real workout in the park.

Despite the very bad experience with the app, the workouts are good though. So I leave 2 stars instead of 1, for the effort of the tutors. 

Subscription cancelled!! I was fine with paying the subscription, considering every day there is a new workout to try out. If only I could enjoy them...

BTW I am on the Quest 2, which should be the official supported platform. Can't imagine how the QA works...

UPDATE: After months and some updates, I still see that precision is below the ground and controllers have their own lives. They keep disappearing, or even worst, sometimes I see them taking a fly in the space or go to visit other players in the space. They need a bit of time out, I guess, which keeps up what I think is the main scope of the app: destroying motivation so you go to a real gym."

BoxVR was a Great game!
Then they forced us the inferior FitXR, with some really bad dancing.  
Nobody asked for that. 
Now they want to force us a subscription based game!

Why don't release 3 separate games so people can choose what they want. Instead forcing us a inferior game!

I am very disappointed!
Now you even role out a defective Update. Making the game Unplayable!

I sincerely, do NOT recommend this game.
They made a good game worse, just to sell us DLC packs
and than decided to make it subscription based..


Little update:


FitXR told me to reinstall the game an clear the cash. So... I did...
I reinstalled the game 7 times cleared cash and continues emailed FitXR. The Game is still unplayable! It just keeps stuck  in the loading screen for hours. If you get past the loading screen its just a hot mess. You can't select anything, even pictures aren't loaded in correctly. You can just stand there and do nothing!

I keep emailing them but I think they stopped responding..


Update 2: 


Wel it works now...

Dancing still sucks!
You got more boxing classes now. Its just the same, just more. 
There is nothing wrong with that, just not 10 dollars subscription worth!

You can filter by trainer but not by difficulty?

786,yoonboy,"Feb 6, 2022 at 2:36 AM",1,i think you have to,"What lesmills does is what I said in the past.  You guys should have taken the form of selling the base game, that is, the legacy separately and adding a subscription, but it became the worst game.  There is no shame in imitating a good model.  You acknowledged your mistakes and did a good job giving it to the legacy, but it was a really stupid project to weaken access to new customers and to miss out on a chance to make money.  It's not too late even now, so look at my advice and the future of lesmills and suck the money.


And tom, you're actually wrong.  There may be various apps, but only the number one always survives.  Up until now, you guys have been number one and irreplaceable monsters, but just play lesmills for one day.  See how smart they are to implement what they see and learn from your mistakes.  They launched this way to suck your customers.  Very clever, they turned off subscriptions from the start and lowered the hurdles.  They're getting people to unsubscribe from fitxr and suck it up.  Is it time to say leisurely that one game doesn't have to be everything?  Admit your mistakes and sell your legacy.  And your role model, supernatural, was a subscription from the start.  And their entry point was very quick and irreplaceable.  If the fitxr team made a game similar to supernatural, they would have to change their strategy.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------




les mills is coming to get you be aware it is better than you stronger than you i dont want to buy fitxr legacy. 
----‚Äì-----------------------------‚Äì------------------------------------------




I think you should sell a new version of fitxr, a version for subscription.  Because after subscribing for a month, I feel that the service you provide to legacy users is unfair, so I don't want to subscribe anymore.  If it was a game that started with a subscription from the beginning, I would be willing to continue subscribing, but it would be unfair if I had to pay monthly to maintain it for the rest of my life with legacy for one purchase.  So, I played Supernatural, which is twice as expensive as you, and I feel fortunate that supernatural was a subscription from the beginning, and I applied for a one-year subscription and started exercising.  I think you guys should make a new subscription type game and sell for one purchase what fitxr provides to legacy users. Then I will buy fitxr legacy, and if the subscription type game is attractive, I will definitely subscribe.  I hope you guys have better results

The reason is that most of the time I do boxing rather than hiit, so I feel that way. i hate dancing by the way

Don't worry too much about legacy users. The new people are the ones who will pay for your games in the future.  New people just found out about fitxr and oculus late, so why accept such an unfair situation?  The best way is to sell the legacy version even if it is more expensive to fix this unfair situation so that people like me will not deviate.  Focus on your future customers.  Come to a good conclusion by stating how many subscribers among legacy users and mathematically analyzing the ratio of how many new users are registered.


$100 a year vs $30 a year for life If you sell a legacy version of the game, even if you sell a lifetime license for $100, I'll buy it.  The bottom line is that you really messed things up.  If I wanted to have a subscription system, I would not have looked like a defector like me if I had subscribed from the beginning with better graphics for the same game.  The reason I am leaving you with this kind review is because fitxr is a good game.  I won't be coming near your game for a year, but when I start my subscription again after a year, I look forward to a new game from your company. I hope it's not a fitxr game then."

I like that I can play against my husband again, although we have Supernatural and just about every fitness game Oculus has to offer (including the waitlist for Liteboxer coming out next week), we always come back to this game. It loses one star because of the music. I would be a paying customer in a moment if they would have the same music as Supernatural, I would even pay more. I never do the dance or the HIIT but music is a great motivator! With over 100lbs to lose, I really wish this game would level up with great music.

Original review 

My husband and I are in our 50s, we used BoxVR as our primary source of cardio. We played together in the mornings. I hate this new iteration.

This is just as much a plea to users as it is a review.  If you don't like the new update, please leave a review and let the devs know! Hopefully our voice will be heard and they will re add BoxVR to the store or at least put the old game as an option within the new game. Let's be clear, this update is an attempt to gamify the cardio experience in the worst way. 

My biggest gripe is that the real-time multiplayer experience is completely gone. I used to play against my husband in the mornings. It wasn't perfect, I couldn't see him, only his score, but we could both play in real time. I used to see group announcements on Discord so that people could get together and work out together. No more.  If you sign up for a group class, those players are not live! It is ghost data from previous players. And who are they? Are they the best of the best?  Can I play somebody at my level so that I'm always not in last place?

Equally as hateful is the dark environment. I am an older player, I do not like dark mode in anything. I am one of the few who does not like beatsaver, Audica, Synth Riders, or any of those dark mode  flashy games.  I like -- LOVED -- BoxVR.  I like the look of a brightly-lit vintage gym, something like Thrill of the Fight. As a matter of fact, I think Thrill of the Fight is going to be my go-to cardio app from now on. That's sad because I really stood behind boxVR and told everybody about it. 

Darn it, why they have to go and ruin a really good thing."

798,Kassandra,"Feb 23, 2022 at 11:56 PM",4,"Fun but after a month, I'm not too sure","I've been playing fitxr when it was boxvr. It was nice. I recently came back to be met with some type of subscription service. I decided to try it and I don't think it is worth it... I'm not too sure what else it gave me besides a few more HIIT classes and a couple of boxing ones. I do like the HIIT classes but is it worth that much? No way...

Edit: I received a response that they have lots of classes to choose from. Let me just clarify, when it comes to the harder modes, there are barely any or at least they get old FAST. Don't even get me started on the classes available on the hardest mode. There's maybe 5?"
799,TexasWildWest,"Feb 9, 2022 at 6:01 AM",1,"Next, the game may be black and white","I originally purchased BoxVR in 2020. It was a solid game to play to get your heart rate going. However, their rebranding to FitXR and the subsequent subscription model really pushed me towards other games.

I normally brag to my pals about the VR studios and how if you buy a game and provide feedback, the dev will often incorporate that feedback. This is something that is missing with the major/AAA studios in our era of ""modern gaming."" 

Why push the limits and take a risk on something new when you can just reskin a game and resell it. Add on top $10 fees for character cat ears or $10 for blue skins on guns/clothes. FitXR can learn a thing or two from them. Just make the next variation in black and white and you have to pay $5 for each glove color. At least it'll only be $5 for blue!

FitXR is the AAA equivalent in the Oculus store.  And that's why I will NEVER support their game or studio in the future."

But since I made the purchase the devs have expanded the experience and made it better in some ways but what makes me give it such a low score is simply when I bought this app there was no monthly subscription fee and I don‚Äôt know about all of you but my bank account can‚Äôt afford any more freaking subscriptions I‚Äôm so sick of them to top it off the developers idea of smoothing over the fact they all the sudden wanna add subscriptions to a product that was sold to me with no mention of said subscriptions they compensated this fact with a whooping 30days free  well thanks but no thanks I‚Äôd rather a refund:
803,Yukon,"Jan 23, 2022 at 4:16 AM",4,BoxVR vs. FitVR,"I‚Äôm a huge fan of BoxVR (PSVR). That is a super entertaining and challenging piece of software.  FitVR excels in a few ways, but takes a back seat in others. 

- BoxVR let‚Äôs you create your own playlists from the in-game library. That‚Äôs such a great feature. Why not in FitVR? 

- The songs in BoxVR are by and large much better than the ones in FitVR. Those BoxVR songs push you to jump, dance, and have fun. The FitVR boxing songs are less so. 

- Bring back the glowing orbs! Those blue and yellow discs are just too drab. 

- Did some of the songs disappear in the latest update?"

I looked at some fitness games to keep me in shape while my city is in lockdown, I seen that this game was only $10 a month with a freetrial, decided to sign up, went to buy groceries since I'm low on supplies, also low on money since I haven't been able to work through lockdown so far, and my card gets declined, look at my account and I'm -$50 due to this game billing annually. 

I would of thought like most subscriptions that are advertised for $10 per month it would be billed monthly and not annually, trying to get refund now, but I think I put in just a little over 2 hours in the 4 days I've had it, pretty solid game, but kind of feel cheated.

Get the user to do more leg movement, on spot sprinting, kicks, high knees or push ups, squats, jumping jack, jumping squats & jacks , lunges, use of weights and many many more. Yes a lot of this can not be tracked to score points but it does not have to be about points. It's not a point scoring game people want, it's exercises. Maybe get rid of dance and put in this none scoring workout section!

Most if not all of the low ratings are from grumbly people unhappy that this happened and do not reflect the actual quality of the app itself.  Which is high.  It is an excellent app, with daily new routines, four levels of difficulty, and trainers who are on the ball.  If you join the Facebook group you can interact with them (and also disgruntled ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù users who can‚Äôt get beyond the change.  Move on people).  Before Christmas they did this cool update that put you in various wintery locations and also had the trainers give more ongoing instruction.  It is remarkably good.  They also have a feedback page on their website where people can recommend changes and it seems that many are included in their updates.  So if you are ok with the sub and can ignore the static from the grumbly ones, get ready to sweat your rocks off."

821,Kurstin,"Jan 13, 2022 at 5:31 PM",5,Great So Far,"I love this app! I've been boxing in real life for over 10 years, and out of all of the boxing apps I've tried so far this one seems to be the best at focusing on form and power. You actually have to put some power behind your hits instead of just bonking a target like you do in X-Fitness. This app really gets you going and you work up a sweat really fast! If you're just looking for a fun game to swing at targets then you might want to try X-Fitness, but if you want an intense workout FitXR is where it's at! I don't mind the monthly fee because there is constantly new content and you would pay the same or more at a gym. There is also the dance and HIIT workouts which are enjoyable as well. I love the unique ways they set up targets to get your body moving in the HIIT workouts and, although I am no dancer, the dance workouts are fun to switch it up every once in a while!"

1. But the most frustrating of all is buggy hit detection so you are doing your best to stay on streak 300-400 and then one hit, you DO hit, it doesn't register and reset from 0 

2. App disconnects from internet at random mid workout but it doesn't tell you, you only realize when you are in the menu and then you go to check your stats after an hour of your workout and what?? you only did 8min coz app disconnected after that. Shocking. No other app have problem with internet, my router is next to me and Quest is still connected when you go to menu, just this app randomly disconnects.

Definitely not worth money they are asking for, you can get several other fitness apps for that yearly subscription that you can pay once and keep, so no thanks, but no"

829,Sunny,"Jan 23, 2022 at 10:33 PM",1,Beware of bait and switch,"Update 1.23.2022
I gave the App another chance and did the Trial.  I was using it more to get a workout in at home during the winter months and decided I would go with a monthly subscription after the trial ended, even though I had to end one workout session early because I could not take the Christmas music in January anymore.  HOWEVER, after the trial it automatically charged me the annual subscription.  The day that the charge hit my credit card I immediatly canceled the subscription, but did not receive a refund, because the cancelation was for the following YEAR!!!  I now have an annual subscription I do not want. FitXR responded saying I could change it in App to monthly, so I tried, the result being it would change to monthly AFTER my year subscription was over. No thank you. Buyer beware!!!!  I feel like this was a bait and switch. 
Prior review
I got the game a few weeks ago and really liked it. I could come home and get a quick 15 or 30 minute workout in. Then one day I went in and found myself in a strange dark room with a disclaimer I was automatically enrolled in a 90 day free subscription. Wait what?!?!  Gone were the familiar  displays and choices. Glitches everywhere. Instead of pictures I got Question marks. When I finally got to start a program the music blasted so loud and it would not respond to my headset. I paused trying to figure out the settings, then no sound at all; finally  the sound was back, but the game glitchy. I gave up. The next day I would choose a class and after waiting for a few minutes would get an error code to check my internet. After that happened 3 times I gave up; after all the definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome. I live in a very rural area and my internet is not the fastest, but at least before the update it worked. Now it is just useless to me. Very disappointed and upset and no, I do not want ANYTHING that is subscription based."
830,Me,"Feb 16, 2022 at 3:42 AM",4,Pleased with XR Fit,"I really enjoyed XR Fit. It‚Äôs a great daily work out. I did everything except for the dance.

And I didn't like the trainer in all 3D animated like a barbie doll with no articulations. Not for me."

I was breathing so hard by the end and was impressed with how many muscle groups I used. I'm not really one for a subscription model though.  I tried out supernatural but it was too costly.  $10/month is better but I already get a gym membership through work and probably won't use this once my free access expires.

5. Meditation ?
6. Something like swords ? Such as best saber and supernatural 
7. Stretching

** update on 16th Feb ** 
----------------------------
Been using it for 21 days straight now... it does keep me motivated...however updating my review a bit.

Songs get a bit repetitive, as I know them all (Only a small selection)
Also, the environments are getting limited now. Lush rainforests, or canyons may help.

Would need some updates in Songs, Environments, and possible more ""moves"" soon too.
 
In addition, stretching and mindfulness/meditation would be a great addition.

Also missing a social element a bit, and leaderboards don't seem to keep my score (E.g. good to have the highest scores in the cloud) ."

Don't get turned off, it's a great app, it's interactive and super fun. Try the trial and you'll see. The product is wonderful but the managerial decisions clearly have room for improvement. First, the transition to a new subscription model wasn't smooth, which has affected its rating. But much more importantly, yesterday I literally was ready to sign up for a subscription, and when I clicked the link within the app, it didn't let me sign up! People here are complaining about not wanting a subscription, i literally wanted one and got a glitchy interface which refused to take my money instead.

849,SKMusic,"Dec 13, 2021 at 4:16 PM",5,Madness,"I wish have gotten into VR workouts earlier! Ever since corona started my otherwise quite active lifestyle has been put to a halt. No more travel, spending whole days walking around, or regular pool visits. Attempts to go jogging or biking trying to avoid people and keep up to date with the latest lockdown/restriction news haven't proven to be too enjoyable either and sleep suffered more and more due to that. And then I came across this app. Wow, what a difference! Whereas with traditional workouts, there is preparation and commute time, popping up the Quest and turning on the game takes exactly no time at all (and is great for the less social people amongst us as well)! 
What I love about it is how easily you get pulled into it - the amount of things happening simultaneously (workout tasks, trainer, music, animations) make your brain really focus and stay in the moment (and totally lose track of time!!!), which besides the physical workout also offers immense relief for the mind, for once forgetting the busy every day, and if you are like me, where I've always got 24 tabs running in my head, a moment of silence and mental relaxation while still doing something productive.
It's extremely easy to get into a routine and I've found myself working out more and more on a daily basis (and yes you'll get muscle ache the first few days :P). I'd love to see more workouts targeting/monitoring legs and torso as well, perhaps when ankle and waist sensors get on the market, as well as meditation/relaxation/warming up sessions. What would also be great is an option to sync the workouts with the apple watch and Health app! Equally, I can see this becoming a great platform for finding new fitness buddies (without the traditional issues us women might face in real life gyms), especially as long as we are still stuck in the mostly non-travelling non-meeting reality. 
All in all really truly worth its money!"

856,Jebus,"Dec 29, 2021 at 3:54 PM",5,Very good fitness app,"I am very surprised to see so many bad reviews about the app. I purchased FitXR before subscription was available, and I can say that the app has improved a lot recently. Not sure, why people, who also bought the app before subscription were complaining about losing their access. All the old trainings are still available, also a few new ones were added for free (e.g. 3 HIIT trainings), in addition, all old users got three months free access to all the features. I think the app is totally worth it even with the subscription. You get new workouts every day, new environments, new features and trainers. It is very clear that developers are working very hard on the app, and honestly in comparison with what it was before, it is totally new level. Of course this costs money, so I think subscription fee is very reasonable. Now about workouts. You can find workouts for all levels, all music tastes, and choose between Dance, Box and HIIT. Personally I mostly use Box and HIIT, which are amazing and make me sweat a lot. Most of the workouts are for the full body, but you can also find workouts with a focus on specific body parts. All workouts, especially HIIT are very different, and I never get tired of using the app. In addition, there is a facebook community where you can share your progress and other people are sharing theirs, which is very inspirational. Great job! I would put even more than 5 stars if I could!"

Still, it is the only app I can push myself on to complete exhaustion, using the HIIT workouts. No matter what the intensity level is set at, you can always push yourself to 100% and exhaust yourself.  The hardest intensity box workouts are more suitable for sustained, high activity, too, but Les Mills is now at least as good if not better for those.

It has a place in my workouts for 5-10 minute all out HIIT sessions."

The most annoying current issue being that despite being a full download, the app forces the user to be always online. So on such occasions that the online service is down, the app is simply inaccessible. There is no reason for having zero offline functionality apart from the gross, money grabbing tactics that already proliferate app marketplaces. Even so, not allowing users access to paid content (through no fault of the user) is unacceptable."

I've seen the spiel, legacy customers get 90 days, keep what you had yadda yadda. I was considering the Rock DLC around the time this change happened but that option was snatched away. 

I am a VERY casual user. I logged in today for the first time in months. Out of my 90 days, I think I played 3 times? So a subscription is a terrible waste of money in my case. But how do I rate this game for other users when they won't get the same stuff that I have. When I logged in today I had 100+ ""workouts"" which seems like a lot? What does a new user see? ..I have no idea if those are permanent as a ""legacy"" user or not. The whole experience is mired in uncertainty and that really sours the experience. 

But ultimately I can't give one star like the majority of the legacy users, because at the core of this app, the punchy punch does feel good. 

I'm not angry, just disappointed, and praying FitXR do not alter the deal further."

880,ofwerman,"Feb 3, 2022 at 7:34 PM",4,Better after the update,"Updated review (Feb 3, 2022):
With the new update that came out now, the punches are now counting much better. Both from the side and the bottom. So they probably did something to this, which is good. A little strange though, that there is still some Xmas music in the boxing pass I tried today. But maybe it's an old recorded class. Doesn't bother me at all. Just a thought.
I will keep my monthly subscription for a while and see if I enjoy the workouts here.
I change my old 3 stars to a 4 instead after the update.

Old review: I tried FitXR for the first free 7 days and thought it was great, but I had some problems in the Boxing where I hit the balls from the side and the bottom. The strikes weren't counted and only the points when I hit them straight. So I wrote an e-mail to the support to ask what I might do wrong. I tried hitting them faster, slower, closer to the body and farther away. But I never found out. And I never got an answer from their support.
Now I'm a monthly subscriber and I did the boxing today and instead of writing the support I tried asking about this problem on their Facebook page and about an hour later I checked that page and my post was deleted.
So, I guess no one in that company care about customers asking about problems. So maybe I should try another app next month. Who wants to use an app where they don't response when a user is having problems."

887,Batlin,"Oct 28, 2021 at 12:05 AM",1,Update: fraudulent bait and switch.,"***Update, October 27, 2021

It's time to update my original positive review of the game that was formerly known as BoxVR.

The publisher has essentially taken a game that worked fine, gutted it to remove the best bits and redefine them as premium content, and now moved even more of the content we paid for into expensive subscriptions.

I honestly think this is illegal, bordering on fraud. Imagine you bought a car that worked fine for a year, then the manufacturer ""patched"" it so that going above 30 km/h requires a monthly subscription, and reversing requires a ""premium"" pack.

Expect to see this turn into a class action lawsuit at some point. People bought the game only to have it stolen away and replaced with a massively cut down model with paywalls everywhere, and as you can imagine, they are not impressed.


***Original review of ""BoxVR"" before the publisher shamefully destroyed the game thousands of people had already paid for:

This is an intuitive and very fun game that has you coming back for more. I've been playing every day, trying to complete all the classes in order of duration, and I feel stronger, sharper and more relaxed each morning since I started.

The music selection isn't huge but it's quite adequate, although it often feels like the orbs arrive ahead of the beat, meaning you have to punch early which goes against my sense of rhythm. This is particularly the case with uppercuts for some reason.

Unfortunately it also crashes frequently. Most days it will freeze in a jarring flicker between two frames, requiring me to force quit and restart the game. This is incredibly frustrating when it happens towards the end of a 57 minute class. It could also benefit from more stats, like individual records for each class, breakdown of errors (like whether you miss more left or right uppercuts).

If they could fix the stability problems, it would be a solid five stars. Hands down the game I've spent the most time in for the Quest."
888,Raheemk9,"Feb 2, 2022 at 5:45 PM",3,Great,"This is a great work out app really gets the sweat on and keeps you motivated throughout the sessions with the personal trainer . 

BUT I would prefer just to buy the game straight up and not have to pay a monthly subscription, just for this reason I have downloaded powerbeatsVR it's a similar type of work out (for the boxing) for a 1 time purchase .

If fitxr did ever become a 1 time purchase I would definitely purchase it as it's a great fitness app."

Updated review! As a legacy customer I was not happy at the changes when the new subscription model was rolled out, I felt it was a totally substandard game to the version I bought, if only FitXR had rolled out the game in it‚Äôs current form, since the recent updates, I would have been happy with the changes. It is back to being a good, fun fitness game that is enjoyable to play and the glitchy gameplay seems to be resolved. I also appreciate the changes made for the legacy customers with the extra games and free game each month, which is a reasonable compensation for the way we were disregarded in the change of model and it‚Äôs good the FitXR acknowledges their mistakes.  The one thing I would like to see further improvement in is the menu system, although it‚Äôs a lot better now I preferred the original BoxVR or FitXR models where you see a list in order of length it was much easier to pick out a workout, hopefully that will come. So it‚Äôs only fair to come back and rate the game in it‚Äôs current form and if they improve the menu again I would happily give it 5*"

928,Penguin1106,"Oct 31, 2021 at 12:17 AM",5,Full on fitness experience,"Glad I didn't read all of the negative reviews before I decided to subscribe to Fitxr because I wouldn't have bothered with it. 
So one comment was (more expensive than going to the gym). No it's not, my local gym is forty pounds a month whereas my monthly subscription to fitxr is one fifth of the price. 
Another comment was that you can't hit all the targets properly because the music tempo doesn't match the speed of the approaching targets. Solution concentrate on the targets instead of the music and you might find yourself doing better. There are plenty more whinging comments and most are about having to pay money for the classes. Do these people not realise that a lot of the money collected goes into updating and researching to providing a better experience for the user.
Okay now I have got that off my chest, here's what I think.  This is a superb interactive fitness workout platform and so easy to navigate the menu and find the classes you want. 
I think the subscription fee is worth every penny and you can have a great workout without having to go to a gym which for some people including myself can be a bit of a  daunting experience. Well done to everyone who makes fitxr what it is and to everyone who thinks they have had a negative experience, maybe try to remember you only get out of something what you put into it. 
If I have upset anyone with my comments never mind you haven't been charged for them."

The developers have righted the wrong, and today I update my rating from 1 star back to 5 star! It's been a difficult half year, but I am glad to see FitXR back to its original glory!  Thank you for all you've done for the ""legacy"" BoxVR / FitXR community!

Update May 27, 2021:

I tried HiiT, it's NOT FUN :( Squat for 35 sec then rest for 10? All while the stupid voice actor keeps talking. This is garbage, for EUR 150 a year? You are joking!  I would rather have BoxVR back where I could box to my own music. Worst bait and switch of all time.

April 16, 2021:

This is what happens to any developer who plays with fire.

SAY NO TO SUBSCRIPTION

People don't like subscriptions, and any developer who tries to do it will be destroyed by the rating system.  Let this be a lesson to all developers!

I am actually sorry for FitXR, someone had to be the poster boy for subscriptions, they ended up getting the heat. I just hope other developers see and take heed.

===== UPDATE =====

I totally understand that you have not taken away anything from existing users. That is why it's unfair that you are being treated like this. But please understand, all this rage is not against you FitXR, it's against the subscription model. People freak out when they hear about subscriptions, and our first reflex is to give 1-star to whoever introduces this in their apps. 

This is just the way people think ""Subscriptions = Greedy developer"" ‚Üí 
 ""Greedy developer = 1-star"". It doesn't have to make sense.

You couldn't have done it any better. Other than not introducing subscription."
933,Jennifer,"Dec 2, 2021 at 10:36 PM",5,This company actually gets it,"I just wanted to say how pleasantly surprised I was with the way the company handled complaints caused by their conversion to a subscription service. They took responsibility, and went overboard in their quest to make it right. I‚Äôm very happy with the results. If you are considering this app, and it still has a star rating that is less than perfect, please take into account that most of those low stars were because of anger over the subscription price for people who had purchased the app earlier. The app itself is really fun/good and always has been. I have bought many apps to work on my cardio, and this is one of the few I keep coming back to."

so if you don't mind having a limited set of exercies: you don't have to pay each month and you can still take advantages of all the new enhancements!

I find enough excuses to avoid going for a run or exercising by myself in the park (it's too hot, it's too cold, it's Sunday..). And the small amount of home gym equipment I've bought has gathered a nice layer of dust because I don't know enough to create my own workouts at home.

With FitXR, I just have to walk into my living room, put on a headset and I'm at the gym with my very own personal trainer. It's so easy to jump into a work out that I can't really find an excuse not to. Not to mention (and past me wouldn't believe I'd say this), but I actually really enjoy it! The scoreboard gets me feeling competitive to beat my own personal best and the streaks make me push myself right up til the very end of the workout. Plus the variation in classes means I can switch it up whenever I want so I don't get bored.

Long story short, there's been no need to wait for New Year to start working on a new me - and those pesky gyms aren't getting any more of my donations!"

HIIT does the kind of squatting and lower body movement I haven't seen done well enough in other apps yet, but honestly it's still glitchy with hit detection failing half the time with my left controller.

All that would be excusable if this wasn't a $10/MTH service. I dunno if they figure due to COVID people will spend their gym membership money on enhanced beat saber with lower tier music or what but $10/MTH is extremely high given you'll likely want just a subset of workouts to do. 

Also, as a company with a history of baiting ppl with a paid app only to then charge a subscription, it's a hard pass for me.

I'll still load it up time to time for whatever free pittance they throw on there but if they want a conversion here, give me a paid a-la-cart with offline capability (current version MANDATES online) or a MUCH cheaper monthly bill.

I want to reward ppl who put work on these things, but I'm also not a sucker."

I bit the bullet and subscribed since I used this app for my workout more than I did my gym. The developers have gone beyond trying to compensate for the extreme change and it is still my favorite app to use on daily basis for a good quick workout. 

I'll gladly spend a monthly fee to keep this app going strong. 


*********Old Review***********
I completely understand doing a subscription model for those few that are passionate enough to dish out 10 bucks a month, but this feature should have been a supplement not a replacement. I bought this appears ago for the sole reason that it was not subscription-based. It does feel like a scam. 

In addition, the new interface is completely confusing. Why would you make something more complicated than it needs to be? 

This is something that used to be my go-to to get my day going, it's now getting uninstalled.  Pretty lame guys!"
947,Rich,"Dec 19, 2021 at 3:27 PM",5,Best fitness app,"Had the original BoxVR and didn't like the idea of a subscription. After hesitating, gave the free trial a go and think it's now the best fitness app.

I've tried many others but none get my heart rate up as much as this while making it so much fun. HIIT is my favourite and I love the variety and choice of classes, types, difficulty, length. 

Voiceovers and trainers are great and are the next best thing to going to real fitness classes. 

As well as new classes regularly being added the developers frequently improve the app and keep adding other new content, like new virtual environments. What would make it even better would be class info on which muscle groups are used and custom playlists.

Highly recommended app which I now use every day."

949,Terry F,10/30/2002 0:00,5,I play this more than I should,"Update: 
So a lot of changes! A subscription model was put into place for new users and optional for legacy members, quite a lot of bugs here and there, and a lot of features that probably should have been tested more thoroughly before sending out to the while (like butchering the game's feature for people who purchased the game ahead of time). During this ""learning period"", a game I absolutely loved was turned into vomit. Unintuitive UI design, lengthy loading times, so many problems overall.

However, after several months of using their audience as test subjects and listening to a lot of feedback, it looks like they're really trying to improve the game, and it shows! I find myself going back to playing daily again, and it's not something left on the back burner. I can now go display this to my friends. And I don't know about some people, but I absolutely love the music since it's not mainstream. 

Old Reviews 3/26/2021: 
I can't relate to other users who played FitXR when it first game out versus what it is right now, but I will say I love this game more than I expected. I'm finding myself promoting the reason to get into VR is because of games like FitXR that absolutely stimulate the body to this level. It's fun hands down, the expansion packs are definitely worth it, and the level of intensity each work out brings is great. This is one of those games that solidify my acceptance into buying a quest 2"

I love how the instructor says more things that keep a person focused and reminding them to watch their form and don‚Äôt just punch but dance and work out those thighs in squat position. Move to the rhythm of the music. It‚Äôs a fun and right way to work out. The rock style really does help because it has that steadiness in the beat that causes one to move in a steady way. You‚Äôd be surprised to find out how much of a dancer you could be when you feel the music.

It shows me my own content by default and the new assets look much better and seem to have much better hit boxes. No interest in subscribing. Plenty of content in the original purchase and better to spend that money on other games if variety is a problem. 

**update... Got frustrated and stopped using it. Today i picked it up again to see if the issues were resolved and no... They aren't. And now it is very difficult to navigate without a subscription... Honestly the only vr game purchase I have ever regretted.


This was one of the first titles I bought with my quest and played consistently for several weeks but then frustration led me to other games and now I am uninstalling it. I think I have the accept that this game was not meant for people like me.

I am a long practiced martial artist and my boxing style is a mix of American boxing with Phillipino martial arts. I find the game cannot track my punch speed. I watch my glove go right through the target with a miss and sometimes see my glove start flying off to the side. (I do not have any issues with this on other apps like path of the warrior or drunken bar fight.)

I find to play this game I have to punch at about 1/5 speed and use veeerrrry bad technique and punching angles. Especially hooks and uppercuts. When I do this I get the high scores. But then the game just becomes boring and the music isn't good enough to keep me engaged. Nowhere near as good as games like synthriders.

It is a good game and is well made overall. I do recommend it if you are not a ninja and looking to add variety to your workout. When I go all out on it I do sweat quite a bit for as long as I can ignore the annoying beep telling me I missed as my glove passes precisely through the target."

This is a great workout and a good variety.  Boxing, HIIT, Dance multiple players.  The harder you work the better your score and it motivates you by showing you what others did.  They track your progress, give you different skill levels to try, new workouts daily and you will feel the burn.  Works lower, upper and cardio very well.

However, I'm new to VR and entirely new to this game which I've paid nothing for, so I'll give my first impression and such.

Upon signing in they offer you to have a 7day free trial. I refused that. And just went on to the free workouts. Really user friendly if you ask me. *shrugs* 
I ran all of those workouts back to back and oh boy I was breathing out my butthole by the end of it. And my fitbit was like ""wtf is happening, you're exercising?""

The music

The fact that you're ""in a class"" with other people and competing against them. 

HERES WHAT I HATE 
The paywall 
The subscriptions 
The tracking can sometimes be a bit wonky. 

WHAT ID CHANGE. 
allow people to purchase one at a time instead of paying subscription? 
Allow people to talk to one another for 5-10secs at the end of class! ""Good job guys!"" Type thing. 
Give more free workouts... Making people pay for their health is disgusting and something needs to change that. 

Anyway, overall ive really enjoyed this and I know you could get fit doing this! 

This has been my Ted talk. Thanks for listening. :)"

985,Oliver,"Nov 26, 2021 at 2:37 PM",5,Developers apologised,"This was originally a 1 star review as I bought BoxVR which was replaced with FitXR and for a long time it would continuously push the subscription. They posted an apology on the 24th November 2021 (https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/developer-post/1221139388380533/) acknowledging their mistakes and showing that they are listening to the community. There was also an update which stopped pushing the subscription model plus you‚Äôre able to have a persistent filter (‚ÄúMy Classes‚Äù via Search) that only shows you content that you have access to. 

I believe they have more than righted their wrong and can once again fully recommend this app. I would encourage anyone with doubts to read their post above. 

Old review below:
==================================

If you pay for an app then you would hope that it would continue to include what you got when you bought it. Unfortunately that is not the case with this. It used to be great but now the content you get included is extremely limited and rather than you progressing, they just dump you back at the locked content instead of the next class. I just went looking for a 7-8 minute class and I think there was only one and that was a beginner. By the time I found a class I wanted to do, sure enough it was locked behind the pay wall.
This change started to happen months ago but I was ok with it because what I paid for seemed to still be there but now it‚Äôs basically unusable beyond an introduction.
Developers, please give us back what we paid for.
Update:
I‚Äôve been reading up more about this and found that BoxVR is still available on my computer/Rift. I also checked the reviews for BoxVR via my original purchase. It has 4.3 stars. To some degree I thought this was an overreaction but now that I‚Äôve tried BoxVR I know that it‚Äôs not an overreaction. There is far more content included, much better categorisation, a couple of DLC packs (which I probably won‚Äôt buy now out of principle), it‚Äôs just a much better product. Plus you have the ability to create your own playlists. It‚Äôs clear the passion that originally created BoxVR has been replaced with a bureaucratic focus on the subscription model.
I guess they removed/replaced BoxVR because if it still existed nobody would buy FitXR instead. Please vote with your money and don‚Äôt support this kind of behaviour.

Thank you very much, that is very awesome! 
I never jumped on the subscription model as I was happy with just the base game.
To this day I love this app, it's been helping me getting through this pandemic and I've been using it almost daily since purchasing it last year. It's  my 'go to' fitness app, even got  the steam version to play whenever the quest is low on batterylife.  (That hopefully won't sound desperate, it just helps me not to worry about charging it in time. ^^) 
Yes, in case anyone's wondering, the quest version is far superior, the punches feel more satisfying ;)
   
Love the new classes and the new winter environments. The workouts are well balanced and feel great & the coaches' encouragements push you further.
I can totally recommend this app for being a great, healthy experience, even more so now after the recent update to make things right. 
In my book you really have earned your 5 star rating :)
And while the subscription model is not really for me right now, that's not to claim it won't be at some point in the future.
Thanks again and my best to the entire FitXR crew!"
994,Walnut,"Oct 23, 2021 at 2:48 PM",5,Box - Your search ends here.,"While this fitness app has HIIT workouts and dance, my focus is on boxing. Over 150 box workouts covering beginner, intermediate, and advanced skill levels allow you to have muscle confusion, music variety, and brain stimulation from mixing it up. You can also save a workout to favorites and take a screenshot of you ending stats so you can revisit a favorite workout to see if you‚Äôve improved. Also, new workouts are added weekly. There are multi- player options, but I have not played in that arena. I will say that you will work up a sweat. You may talk to yourself. You may feel like Rocky at the end of a good round. The Facebook group is optional, but the team there is supportive and they have challenges to keep you reaching for a goal. It‚Äôs nice seeing other people talk about their workouts and their fav workouts. I could keep writing, but the 5 stars should say it all. What you really want to know is if this app is worth a monthly subscription. That‚Äôs up to you. Take the trial and box every day to really experience this app. I think it‚Äôs worth it and will continue as a subscriber and supporter of this app and their team."
995,Badmouth,"Jan 6, 2022 at 2:24 AM",1,The Value's Just Not There,"Sad to see what's happened to this game. As an overall fitness system it's just far too limited to justify a subscription model at this price. Still suffers from bugs dating back to the BoxVR days (hitches, freezes, crashes, unreliable punch speed measurement, laughably inaccurate calorie burn calculation, late sound effects on blocks). It's still fun and a great cardio workout in boxing mode (does anyone even use the clunky dance mode?) but it's only a partial fitness system and costs more than more complete alternatives that offer strength and flexibility workouts as well."

Thank you. 

I hate that I bought this game for $30 when it was BoxXR but now you expect me to subscribe or have nothing. At least give us the option to refund our money. 
But I tried the 90 days ‚Äúfree‚Äù (even though I paid for the app) and it‚Äôs a totally better app now than when I last used this 6 months ago. There‚Äôs dancing now. I don‚Äôt know what to think, but I think we should be grandfathered in to the subscription for free, and charge anyone else that gets the app. So 3 stars."

Gives you the feel of being in a class to push you but without the embarrassment. Monthly fee seems very reasonable and probably something I will continue. It‚Äôs a shame they can‚Äôt resolve the dispute with those who bought the software before they changed their business model cos this app definitely deserves more than the 3 star average. Anyway there‚Äôs a free 7 day trail so I would recommend stop reading and start trying it out.

2 - I can't even load any programs because it keeps giving me an internet connection error, even though my headset is connected to the internet.
PURE.TRASH.

Edit: 11/5/2021 - Can you confirm that the 90 day trial can be avoided in the first place? I don't want to deal with any trial and having to worry about cancelling anything. Just let us use what we've already purchased without pop-ups, trials, etc.

I pre-emptively sent a request to cancel my sub/trial immediately just incase you plan another bait and switch.

Just sad and pitiful. Paid full price for the game last year, and now it's behind a subscription pay wall. 

Reminds me of Activision-Blizzard and the bad products they've been putting out. For anyone else interested, there was legal action taken against them for a less severe ""bait and switch"" attempt for one of their recent re-releases of an awesome game. Everyone who purchased was allowed to get a refund - hopefully we can do the same for this game.

You should grandfather people in if they already purchased the full game, or just release the new content you added to another title instead of changing an existing title that people already paid for.   

And then on top of it all they add an internet requirement??? Why change this? Why mess with people's product they paid for and ruin their experience just because they may have poor internet connections.

If they wanted to continue offering more content - they should have used an ""expansion pack"" approach; by genre would have been nice. You like K/J-Pop buy that expansion. You like 50s/60s oldies - buy that expansion. But leave what people purchased alone.

Find ANY OTHER game. Don't give these developers a cent. Others have recommended PowerBeatsVR, X-Booster and Supernatural - I'll be checking out those games and making sure it's not by the same company."

Today I turn it on to an update, and that update was pure 100% uncalled for with their new suddenly thrown in subscription. I would never of bought this game  had I known they would pull this. I can't afford much, and $9.99 a month is crazy. I enjoyed the new songs in the rock section that finally actually became rock, and now it's all going to disappear once the trial is up? What kind of company does this to their costumers with no warnings? I might consider this monthly thing if they improve the music more. Everything is Hiphop and Pop. I can't stand this kind of music, before the update even rock wasn't rock at all but hiphop and pop. We need way more rock, classic rock, and genre's like 80's music would be awesome on a workout game. At least Super  Natural has some 80's in it and classic music like the Beach Boys!  You need to drop this greed and let people enjoy these games they bought without the worry of money killing them. This is just ridiculous for the amount of songs you do get.  

UPDATE! 12-29-21
           If you are having problems choosing the $9.99 subscription plan like I was, check to see if your headset needs to be updated. I updated it and it finally worked! Though I am still not happy about this subscription for something I already paid for, I really love this game far to much to be able to part with it. It's really helped me get into shape and I love it for that! It's so intense, it will get your heart racing, you will sweat buckets, you'll be in pain, but in the end, it's so worth it to me.

I‚Äôm on the fence about whether I‚Äôd prefer the random DLC music pack option that some other games have or a subscription option. Both have benefits.

It seems like a lot of the feedback and reviews have resulted in features and  improvements in the game, so the devs are obviously working hard. 
Keep up the good work."

1020,Gary,"Dec 16, 2021 at 8:16 PM",4,Mostly good,"UPDATE - December 16 2021
A new update was released 2 days after my review, and this build addresses most of what I thought was lacking in class-finding. 

The Home page now shows filters for instructor, class type, music type, level, which makes it far easier to find a good class.

I'd still like to see some info on each class at this screen, which would show if I've played it before. That would help me identify classes I've not taken before. Seeing my stats for classes I've taken in the past would also be interesting and be a good motivation for me to try and beat previous scores.

Updated my rating to 4 stars.

==================================================================

Original Review

I really like the core game - it's fun and gets you moving a lot and I was sore for a few days after starting.

Now for this missing things...
* It needs more environments. There are a handful but most are not very inspiring. I typically choose from 2 that I like (Daytime mountain top and rooftop)
* I don't see how it tracks the classes that I have previously taken. I've had to start using the star system to manually track that myself. Also, clicking on the star is a pain - you have to be pretty exact. 
* It would be nice to see what I scored on previous playthroughs of a class so that I can try to beat my personal score
* There doesn't seem to be a way to filter classes - either by level, previously taken, or music type
* The game seems to be a lower resolution to me than other games. Is it optimised for Quest 2?

So, I'm enjoying it but there are some core features that I'd expect the developers to add to make it more useful. It feels almost like a prototype in that the core part of the game is there (and is good) but it needs supporting features to give a more complete experience. With a paid subscription model, my expectation is to see more substantial improvements than just new classes (how expensive can it be to create a new class?)."

Now they have had locating your purchases DLC nearly impossible by hiding deep in an awful UI and added the new subscription system.

This isn't what I purchased, they changed the app so many times from the game that I originally purchased which seems very unfair.

I downloaded the free trial to try it out, but at the end of the trial (7-days) it charged me right under $100 for a whole year subscription. The trial should have ended and asked me to subscribe to the monthly or annual subscription if I wanted to keep playing.

1027,Tyril,"Nov 16, 2021 at 1:30 PM",1,This is why we can't have nice things.,"The core mechanics of the game are nice.  I like the boxing workouts.
That said, the company is more interested in coming up with new ways to ask for money, without actually earning it.
Every new feature added to the game is just a way of funneling you into getting a subscription, while actual improvements for the user are an afterthought.

Ongoing issues include:
- Game frequently lags
- Controllers frequently lose sync (but this isn't happening in other apps, so it's probably a software not hardware issue)
- Workouts that were previously available to all users are now behind a pay-wall.
- The Favorites menu is buried in settings instead of being on the front page.
- There's no Exit button. Instead you're expected to use the Oculus button to bring up the overlay and quit that way. This doesn't consistantly work however, leading to a frustrating experience when just trying to leave the game.

I've tried to grunt and bear the developer's poor decisions, but the controller sync issues have recently become more pronounced, so I'm finally going to try a different game.  Maybe Thrill of the Fight or Creed."

And I knew they had updated it on Quest and I kept hearing about mentioned in the same breath as Supernatural and that game looks really polished.  So I was really surprised when I played FitXR to see how far it as come.  It finally feels like a proper game.  The hits are finally satisfying.  BoxVR felt amateur.  This game feels professional.  A little bit like Biggest Loser for Wii, but even more polished than that game!
Now, subscriptions do suck and they should add an option for DLC for people who can't subscribe to a game indefinitely.  I understand from a dev standpoint having people subscribe to your game forever sounds very apealing but please try to be realistic."

There is currently 79 different workouts to choose from in the HIIT session which is outstanding.

The exercise instructions for each set are clear, and really get me working up a sweat very quickly, and I like that there is a selection of instructor avatars with personality, to demonstrate each movement. 
I occasionally try the other workouts (dance and boxing) but my go-to is definitely HIIT.

I would like to add a few ideas that developers might like to consider for future updates, which would essentially absolutely complete this app for me, and make leaving the house to go to a gym redundant. Perhaps the option to add warm ups and cool downs? But also potential Body Balance sessions? (I.e. Yoga, Tai Chi, and Pilates mixed sessions)

Hope this is useful!"

1054,Nigel Senior,"Dec 3, 2021 at 4:54 PM",4,Benefit of doubt,"Update 3 Dec 2021

FirXR seemed to have recognised the issues and provided some compensation for the subscription issues.

Are they genuine, don't know but I am giving them the benefit of the doubt :)

Update 17 October 21

I am using this now a few times a week. Basically have setup a list of favorites. It's still good mechanics but the content option is very bad e.g. can't buy new content.

Boxing good enough
Dance not for me
Hit ok good but limited by content

Noticed rating is now 2.9 ouch :( that's under 50%. Wonfering how the company thinks they can turn this around. Maybe split the product in two, full price and subscription with different content options. 

Frankly not sure they will survive.  Which is sad. But any app that thinks it deserves a monthly fee needs to be very good e.g. office 365 level good.  FitXr isn't.

Update 22 September  21

Been playing a bit lately and have found a way to navigate that's OK.

The key issue for me now is NO DLC content. It doesn't even need to be commercial hits, home-grown music is fine.

Fix this and I will adjust my review.

Update 6 August 21

Tried it today now my subscription has ended. 

The menu is still awful and basically pushes you towards subscription. 

Yes it's possible to find owned content but you have to work at it :(

Update 26 May

HIIT is quite good, would be happy to purchase this as DLC type content.

Won't be changing my review though until DLC is reenabled :)

Subscription release

Like a few others I find the subscription model disappointing. Yes all the original content is there but there is no ability to purchase DlC packs. 

I saw your arguments that subscription is better value than a DLC, but that's not true as the subscription is much more over time.

I do like the game but having paid $40 already I am disappointed that I can no longer buy DLC content to.

Back to 1 star for you - your review rating is quickly dropping so your unlikely to get new customers. :(

RE UI suggestions - NO POINT AS THE UI IS MEANT TO BE BAD. Then the user just selects ""class of the day"" out of frustration, hence then hooked into subscription model. That's an awful way to treat customers ,:("
1055,CaptainFada,"Dec 18, 2021 at 10:30 PM",4,Ok the developers are trying.,"Just don‚Äôt do it . Trust Everyone, don‚Äôt bother your time and money .

It‚Äôs true I have all my previously purchased content . But it‚Äôs hard to find that content as you have no choice but to scroll through classes that are not available.

The HIIT was ok, and I‚Äôd buy a subscription but not $120/ year .  Why don‚Äôt the developers try a version without music to save on license fees to artists?  I‚Äôm sure many people like me put in AirPods to drown out the terrible music options .

Fitxr shame on you guys! You're the first gaming company I have dealt with in my 30+ years of gaming that has pulled such an underhanded move! How dare you lock me out of maps I purchased and hide it behind a subscription! Never have I seen this before never! So that is how scummy this move is!

What went from a daily exercise game I enjoyed to now a free game since I got a full refund should never have happened the 4 free maps are crap and it's not even playable or in synch anymore.

Thank you kindly for ruining my first VR game and experience! 

I have never felt so disgusted, disappointed or cheated in my life from a gaming company.

RE: developer response. 
I have access to the game and I have access to nothing that you mentioned I have the base game only. Due to refund I have a free game but it's useless access to the base game which is garbage locked behind a subscription."

Yet lo and behold, today when I tried the Quest version again, a section ""My classes"" was available with all my usual classes (including my favorite, ""let's work""). The HIIT classes are also quite nice.

Having tried Supernatural and this, I would say this is wins due to the price.  If Supernatural could somehow lower their cost to around $13.99/mo. I‚Äôd probably be on that app instead.

I give it four stars as there is room for improvement for sure.   

Areas to improve:
-Trainers don‚Äôt train on form/technique etc. They simply add a few phrases to try and encourage you as you‚Äôre working out.  They basically give off the vibe of being hired actors and not personal trainers.

- Don‚Äôt let the levels teach you how to box. Having studied martial arts and American boxing, I can tell you some of the combos you are forced to do you would never throw in the ring.   Treat it like a game.  Don‚Äôt get injured.

- $7.99/mo. Feels like a better price for what you get here."

A variety of different workout classes to do. I particularly love the box classes.

The shere willingness to acknowledge your mistakes towards the DLC community is awesome and the recent fixes you did to help that along truly helps. I also have the original on the Quest, so this is great.

The only thing I really hate on the Quest 2 app is the long loading screen at the start of the app. Fix that, and you have a five star app."
1072,Gamer Girl,"Dec 18, 2021 at 2:48 PM",4,New to FitXR,"I did the free trail for the 7 days and I liked what they had to offer. I was a little hesitant first about a monthly subscription but I was like either way I‚Äôll have to pay for a monthly subscription, if not on the app then at the gym. I‚Äôm not too fond of the gym, so I said I‚Äôll try it. I‚Äôm on the app getting my full body cardio at least 3 times per week. I would give it five stars but the lagging drives me crazy, causing me to miss punches and the music is horrible. Please update these things and you will possibly have a better app. I appreciate you adding all the workouts. Oh and change the way you have to score. I‚Äôve hit all my marks on one workout and still ended up in 6th place. It shouldn‚Äôt matter how hard you hit, it should only matter if you hit the mark. Not sure if you guys do that to make the workout more like intense but it‚Äôs already a good workout with the swinging of the arms. The dance portion is ok, but again you need better music. When I chose the hip hop option, I was expecting to hear like Cardi B or something. The HIIT was fun as well, but it kind of messed up my back. Maybe my form was off but I‚Äôll try again. Developers, please update your music playlist and the glitching. Over all I enjoy the app but make it better to keep me as a customer."

It gives you lots of fun ways of getting some cardio exercise  and keeps you motivated to continue to push yourself. The subscription add variety to the content and makes it easier to try new exercises. The only downside is that it is a tad expensive, especially if you don't use it everyday.

1086,Jezza,"Oct 16, 2021 at 10:45 AM",5,I am the first to criticise,"So I am the first to criticise when something is maybe not as it seems, ie I've paid money for a game and then suddenly it becomes a subscription.  So I bought this game like a lot of others then suddenly the developers thought, I know let's offer more content with subscription at 7.99 a month.  OK I wasn't a happy camper.  I had initially bought this game like everyone else in good faith to get fit and lose some weight.  I refused to pay 7.99 a month to subscribe.  However as time went on and I thought this is getting a bit boring playing the same fitness games over and over I decided that instead of buying 4 chocolate bars per week I would subscribe. So I did. Let's face it its ¬£2 per week its not going to break the bank.  If it is don't subscribe.  I use it daily. Its the only game I have bought(and I've bought a few) that seems to get me up to a sweat and I've lost a stone and a half in weight.  So as I said in my title I am the first to moan and I am the first to criticise however if you want a challenge then this is the game for you.  The only frustrating bit is they've made the levels really quiet hard! So for the cost of prime/Disney per month where you sit on your a..e and gain weight, you too could subscribe to a fitness app that is available when you are and lose some pounds in weight. Oh and another thing new classes are added daily which is even better!"

The pros are that you can set yourself a continuous workout without stopping between songs so your heart rate stays up. I played this in the first year and found it good for this purpose.

The dance stuff is terrible. The tracking feels off and very unsatisfying.
The hit stuff that came in later is a bit better but often you'll be severely punished for missing a target, which you'll always think you hit.

It blows my mind that they don't mix the workouts, that would make more sense.

I liked it OK and used it regularly until the update which requires a subscription. Just grubby. It certainly comes off as greedy when everything they add is nothing you would pay for as DLC.

It's particularly insulting that I already paid for a complete game and now it's asking for me to pay for it over again, in perpetuity. A promising title originally, but in the end, it just feels like a less good beat sabre."

1097,Apothekenbier,"Oct 8, 2021 at 9:08 PM",1,"(Updated) Good, but instable (for me)","Update after 1-2 years:

I paid 30 bucks for this game. It now has been transformed into a 10 per month subscription based game without warning. Basically all settings are gone and you start from scratch.

Positive: Now you can train with other people as an additional boost in motivation.

Negative: All of the below criticism is still true. In addition to the cash grab.

Updated review to 1 star, because they basically removed my paid game from the library and replaced it with a new subscription based game. There is not a single excuse, why this should be okay.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I think this app delivers everything you need for the daily fitness session. It would be really enjoyable for me, if not for two issues:

1) Tracking / Timing: For me it would feel the best, if the actual hits would time perfectly with respective music beats. However, it seems slightly off and the actual best timed hits would have to be earlier and further away from the body than expected. Compared to Beat Saber for example, you have to time your hits earlier and the window of time is very small. If the hitboxes get to close to you (but still clearly in front of you) there is no way to hit them. (-1 star) Since you can get used to this and the primary target for me would be fitness anyways (and not high scores anyways).

2) Crashes (Quest version)
This is a real problem for me ( -2 stars). I cannot finish a sessions longer than 15 minutes, because after about 15 minutes every training session just auto-quits. The fact that progress is not saved is one issue, but actually stopping your workout because of a technical issue and then starting from scratch again with respective setup time is annoying and kills the fun for me.

Apart from that and if you have no issues with crashes, this game would be well worth the money. For me personally it is not. With both issues fixed, this would be 5 stars."

1101,CRyPTiC76,"Dec 7, 2021 at 10:59 AM",4,"Great game, legacy users compensated","Update 6th of December 2021:

To my surprise today I got a very response on my original review of the 16th of August 2021, in which I complained about what was done towards legacy customers.
A lot of legacy customers had bought the game at premium price, to find themselves confronted with a game that was suddenly ""free"" but with a subscription model instead and with loss of filtering functionality.
Basically this rendered the game close to useless without a subscription. I myself and many with me felt scammed and forced into a subscription model.

I complained about this in my review and suggested what is in my opinion a fair solution: 
* fix the search and filtering functionality
* as compensation for all legacy customers that paid full price, make all the pre-existing DLC packs available to them for free

Quite some time passed and I actually stopped playing the game entirely, due to its interface not working for me at all anymore.

I am very very very pleased to see that they finally listened and have done exactly what I suggested.
Talk about a turnaround!

Legacy users have now been compensated properly and the game works as well or even better than before including other improvements.

With regard to the game itself: I bought it mainly for the boxing. The dancing is not really my thing (didn't work for me as I had difficulty remembering and following the instructions).
Since that time a new HIT mode has been added, which I haven't really given a good spin yet, so I can't really determine how I feel about that yet.

Due to me not liking recurring payments and not liking the dancing, I'm now giving this game 4 out 5 starts.
I do recommend the game, just for the boxing itself, which is a great workout and actually can make you sweat and get muscle aches from the workout.

1125,Ted Werdolf,"Dec 6, 2021 at 7:26 PM",3,Better late than never ‚Ä¶,"06.12.21 They had to act and they did. Buuuuut, why so late? Haven‚Äôt we made it clear months ago? I‚Äôm now giving it another try, everybody deserves a second chance. Maybe they have learned it the hard way and hopefully they will be better in communicating before they make such huge changes in the future. I still think the subscription isn‚Äôt worth 120 Euros a year, but maybe some people like subscription services, I prefer one time payment and dlc content. Now that they gave us pre subscription owners all the dlc‚Äôs for free, my anger is gone.  Even though I would have loved it more if they would still offer new paid dlc content regularly. However, I accept it as a very very very late apology. I changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars and maybe I will raise it more, but first let‚Äôs see what the future brings‚Ä¶



My previous comments (1 star review), for those who are interested what happened‚Ä¶

My last words about it..l forget it, do yourself a favour and buy X-Booster from AppLab. They had enough time to change it back to download content, but I think they don‚Äôt want to because of their share holders.

A little update to my review and so I lost all likes! I Wonder why it still has a 3 rating‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs fun‚Ä¶ no forget it, I mean after all those 1 star reviews üôÄ OMG 38%. This developers has no balls to apologise and admit that they made a terrible mistake to go to the subscription based payment model and scammed thousands of former loyal customers who had already paid the full price. It‚Äôs fun to see them go down‚Ä¶ well deserved‚Ä¶

Eleven days ago I wrote!
Deeper and deeper‚Ä¶ now 35% 5 üå†and the same 1 üå† star reviews, I guess without all those fake ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è reviews it would be even lower‚Ä¶

Omg, the HIIT is the worst thing I‚Äôve ever seen in VR. I was curious and gave it a try, guess what? The trainers look like bad Nintendo Wii characters with extremely choppy animation. Then the virtual trainers are talking the whole time- very annoying. Well the orbs look good but that‚Äôs already the best I can say about it. Another reason for not subscribing üëé üëéüëé

What the fu‚Ä¶ sorry I meant fake ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è reviews are popping up‚Ä¶ There was a time when we said ‚Äúa game worth playing is a game worth paying ‚Äú we never said it‚Äôs worth renting üëé

Update 08.05.21 the only interesting thing about the app for me is to check weekly how far the ratings go down. I‚Äôm always making a screenshot and keep it in my gallery. I‚Äôm not playing this anymore because of the shady behaviour of the developers. How deep must it drop to make them change their minds about that subscription. I‚Äôm really curious what happened to their sales, I would not be surprised if they also went down. They should apologise and give us back what we have paid for and maybe the ratings will raise again. 

From a solid 4.5 star rating to 3.1 is the prove of wrong business decisions and ignorance of this company‚Ä¶

Updated 28.04.21

Please also read the new 5‚≠êÔ∏è ratings!  When a product rating is going down since they changed it to subscription and ‚Äúindependent‚Äù reviewers use almost the same words as the developers it appears that something is wrong. Let‚Äôs just make it clear: BoxVR was great with the possibility to load your own music. FitXR has removed that and replaced it with DLC. Wasn‚Äôt good but acceptable. You knew what you have paid for and now you can‚Äôt get DLC packages anymore. You have to pay a monthly fee and you have to be online while BoxVR was working offline. They have taken away functionality and content and want you to pay every month. If BoxVR would still exist as a separate app nobody would complain about that subscription service. But the developers have taken our money for a different app and turned it into something most people don‚Äôt need. But hey, if you still believe those 5stars ratings‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a free world ( well sometimes)‚Ä¶

Update 27.04.21

I‚Äôve noticed that all over sudden a lot of 5 star reviews appeared since the last update. I‚Äôm not saying that all of them are fake but it really makes me wonder if this can be true. Ask yourself if you really want to pay 120 bucks a year for just one single game and rate this with 5stars. I‚Äôve taken my time to read a lot of them and they all appear to be a bit similar. Obviously you have to decide on your own‚Ä¶

- 

Thank you for this nice lesson in capitalism and greed. It‚Äôs not free, it costs 120 Euros a year if you want all content. If you have bought it before you can not expand it with new content unless you pay a monthly fee. I‚Äôve bought it as a boxing game and now it has hiiit or dance workouts I don‚Äôt ever use. There‚Äôs no value for a lot of people in it that justifies this enormous price. I guess beat saber with all music packages is cheaper and you can buy them if you want. Most people don‚Äôt want to rent a game like this. For me it‚Äôs still a quick workout after the unbelievable long loading time of the app. I was halfway happy with the app before it turned into what it is now and now I own a game without expanding ability if I would not subscribe. It‚Äôs really not fair to turn a paid app into a ‚Äúfree‚Äù subscription app. Feels like we got scammed‚Ä¶ At least there are some good alternatives like Synth Riders or Beat Saber"

12/2/2021:  I tried the one-week trial.  With so many options, I really need those class descriptions.  Also, during my drive to Philly, I tried the offline access, but it didn't work.  That is a loss.  The advance-search/filter is helpful ... glad you have it.

7/15/21: I just saw your reply to my concerns.  Very helpful. I look forward to the changes you plan to make. I like your approach to the fitness space - so, I am rooting for you and l anticipate the improvements.
7/14/21:  I am a daily user of FitXr. I like the HIIT addition. I play recreational tennis and this new environment has directly improved my mobility on the court. 

However, I really struggle with the new menu. Also, where can I find full class descriptions that allow me to see the nature of the workouts. Specifically, the HIIT workouts have a wide range of variation and I don't know which classes are offering upper body versus deep knee bend focus.

Without the offline feature, this app has really taken a step backward.


I will be sorry to lose HIIT when my 90 day access is discontinued. However, without the offline access- which I use when I do my red eye driving- and with the poor menu it now has, I do not feel this is worth $10 a month. $120 a year, for perpetuity, is a lot of money for a VR app."

1136,ZombieBrandon,"Dec 6, 2021 at 2:46 AM",2,Increasing from 1 star to 2. Positive!,"**Update**

YES!! After FitXR issued a tone-deaf ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if you were offended‚Äù apology, I was apprehensive about what their next move would be. But whatever. I‚Äôm not the Tone Police and I‚Äôm a reasonable person. If they truly made an effort to restore FitXR back to its BoxVR glory than I would become a fan again. And so far? They‚Äôre on the right track! I worked out in FitXR today for the first time in a while and instead of being angry I just... had fun! The new format for existing customers is perfect and what should have happened day 1. There is a big button to become a member IF I CHOOSE and all of my content seems to be easily accessible without stuff I can‚Äôt use and don‚Äôt want to see. And Angel‚Äôs (the trainer) free course was so good that it makes me see value in subscribing IF I CHOOSE.

It‚Äôs not perfect yet. There is still a massive flaw in the UI with having you select course length by ‚Äúshort‚Äù ‚Äúmedium‚Äù and ‚Äúlong‚Äù which are terms that have absolutely no meaning. (Want to box for 20 minutes? Which category do you think that would be?) And as far as I know, there is no option to play offline which was a necessary feature for people who wanted to take exercise on-the-go to a hotel or something. (I used boxvr to keep warm in the Texas power outage blizzard last year.)

But I understand that things change (within reason) and not everything is going to stay exactly the same forever.

I give FitXR another star for being on the right track with more to come if they continue to be a friend to their customers instead of the enemy.

For the first time in, what, years(?) I feel like FitXR is moving forward instead of backwards."

I do feel like there's been a bit of a step back when it comes to searching for classes though. If I want to find short boxing classes, there doesn't appear to be an easy way to do this. If I select all boxing classes, I can't filter by class duration. But if I filter by class duration first, then this seems to mix all the dance, HIIT and boxing classes together.

It can also be frustrating when the trainer disappears once a HIIT workout starts, as it's sometimes difficult to remember what the move is meant to be when you actually have to apply it when hitting the orbs.

Overall, I'm glad the app is being updated to keep it feeling fresh, and that definitely shows. But, it could definitely use a bit of refining from a user experience standpoint."

Let me tell you a story, I went to a used car dealership and they sold me a car that looked brand new. Soon as I drove it off the lot, it fell apart because it had no motor and was held together with duct tape from the inside. 

I complained to the car sales man and he said, you need to buy our duct tape insurance which costs 10 times more than the car. And told me how much of a genius he was to invent duct tape insurance and how much of a privilege it was for me to pay for it. 

I asked, ""Why didn't you tell me about the duct tape insurance when I bought the car"".  He replied. ""Hey I guess communication is something I need to work on, give me more money,  I've got a party on my third yacht going on to celebrate this new influx of cash... Can you believe it? We did this to thousands of people! We're swimming in cash!"" As he popped open a champaign bottle.


This is fitxr.


Eh.. these are con artists in every sense of the word. They rebrand themselves when they get too much bad press and want to take more money from people, RIPPING off new unsuspecting customers. You've been warned. DO NOT TRUST THE FAKE 5* REVIEWS.

If you really must find a fitness app to sub to, look up Supernatural for a legitimate honest dev

There are also other apps on quest that dont require subscription and even free ones on applab.

My entire quest library consists of fitness apps and fitxr by far has been the worst experience I've ever had on the quest and gaming in general.

Update 5/08:
Official fitxr twitter account implied all these negative reviews are fake. And prospecting subscribers should join their facebook group for real reviews. Note the facebook group is heavily moderated, censored and private. Bad form fitxr, you really are throwing all your existing customers under the bus. Really, rather than burning bridges, be proactive in making things right with your customers. Just fix the game, make your userbase happy and positive word of mouth will return.


Update 5/07:

   They added filters, but unlike the version before this update, its buried under a bunch of menus and submenus. Almost a month in and this is how they implement filters. This must be a design by choice to remove convenience, why? My guess is to funnel users towards music choices and trainers the devs want you to use. You can make a guess why. 

    Theres a reason why such an important feature like filters were not originally implemented, folks. Also why most of the new positive changes are being withheld until a later date. Enjoying your 90 day ""free"" trial?

   Also see a few positive reviews about the devs fixing everything. Which is untrue. Audio output via earbuds are still broken since first day of new update, contrary to what some reviews claim about fixed audio. 

   Really dissapointed with the state of the game. After all this time, it's obvious the decision the devs chose to go with is doubling down on their anti consumer decisions and ignoring the userbase. This is a certainty now that we see how they handled filters and ignore every other request from existing users.

   Its almost as if they're intentionally trying to kick all previous users off the app (the ones they took $30+ from), so they can save costs on their end. Really really disappointing they doubled down on everything.


Update 4/29: 
     
   No bugs have been fixed, roughly two weeks into the 90 day trial and it's still broken and missing many features. I still can't use this app properly. Very dissapointed, they also seem to be charging some players already. $120 a year is a bit of a stretch. 

   Can't see how the devs can justify charging subscription for this. Games like Audio Trip, Beat Saber, OhShape,  Knockout League, Thrill of the Fight, Pistol Whip, Creed, Dance Central, The Climb, and way more exist on the Quest 2.. you really  need to offer far more for $120/yr.

   I use the quest mainly for fitness, and I'll tell you this... I DON'T play only one app for exercise. I use multiple games per session and I'm pretty sure many others do the same. Just saying... $120/yr to be a beta tester for you, is a bit of a stretch.

   Here's some constructive criticism, make things right with your existing customer base first, you've offended a large portion of users and you need to make things right before expecting them to double/triple dip your app.  Providing the 90 day trial for a beta app is terrible optics. Your userbase is smarter than that. We are potential customers, not unpaid game testers.

    Own up to your mistakes and provide a concise roadmap and detailed description of what existing customers are to expect  once the 90 day trial is over. If you are going to remove DLC, you need to provide a comparable alternative that doesnt require subscription and offer good value for customers before the change .

   Don't try to spin the narrative, its insulting our intelligence. We all know a successful subscription model is far more profitable for you as a company than a one time purchase. Even more so if your customers that paid the initial one time purchase,  agree to an additional subscription fee. We know this has nothing to do with pro consumer choices.

   Spinning this and commenting on how good this change is for the customer is a huge misstep. You might as well say it's for customer ""Pride and Accomplishment"". You know the.. EA response that changed the entire industry.

   Yes I know about sunk cost fallacy and what an open forced trial does for consumer psychology with the rules of reciprocity and all the marketing manipulations. You may fool some but most people see right through this. As demonstrated by all the customer reviews rejecting the 90 day trial.

    In all sincerity, though it may not be your intent, the way you are handling the situation comes off as malice. And trust needs to be reestablished with your existing userbase before you expect us to continue supporting you. Remember, underpromise and over deliver is a good rule to go by.  Can the devs turn things around? I hope so, there is a lot of potential with this app. But sadly it's a total mess atm.

Response to the initial subscription change below.

‚Äê------------

I bought this game 3 weeks ago with the understanding that it's a fitness game with a one time $30 purchase for premade classes w/one time purchase DLC packs. Today it's now free and asking for a $10 subscription. DLC packs have been removed entirely from the store...

  I feel this was completely disingenuous on the part of the developers and there was no transparency regarding this change. Consumers were unable to make informed decisions with the purchase of the game. 

   Since I bought this free game plus sub, for $30 three weeks ago, it sits right outside the refund window. And from my understanding I need to pay $10 a month on top of my initial $30, with no one time purchase options for DLC packs.

   There should be greater transparency from the devs. I understand this game would benefit from a subscription model, I just wish the devs made this change more clearly represented to the consumer beforehand. To be absolutely clear, I would have NOT purchased this app for $30 if I knew there were plans to switch the game over to a subscription model. 

Update 1: 

   I keep seeing a copy and paste response from the devs that the subscription is not mandatory. This is misleading and untrue. Prior users purchased the game with the understanding that we may purchase new content as DLC packs in addition to the base game of $30. Now the DLC packs and all future content has been removed and put behind a mandatory monthly subscription.  

   If subscription was not mandatory, why were the DLC packs removed from the store for existing customers? We no longer have access to DLC in the store? 

    To see an official dev response trying to spin an obvious anti-consumer update as being pro-consumer is utterly baffling.

   
Update 2: 

    Also the game in it's current state is essentially a paid Beta, there are many bugs i.e. earbuds do not work, pause functionality is glitchy, filters are removed. Existing base content is not separated by playlist but buried in a massive song list. New Hiit game mode is absent and multiplayer is not like what you see in Beat Saber, but rather single private room invite only sessions.

   Subscription is automatically enabled for existing players that purchased the game before the update (90 days extended trial), and there is no option to disable it within the oculus app nor the game itself.

   Please Oculus, make an exception for refunds with this game outside the 2 week period. Thisl is a drastic change, without any forewarning to those that purchased prior."

I was worried when I saw all the negative reviews. I had shelled out quite a bit for the base game and DLCs and didn't want to lose anything. So I searched online and found this:

Q & A with Sam Cole, FitXR CEO and Co-Founder

If I don‚Äôt want to pay a subscription, will I lose access to FitXR? 
Sam Membership is totally optional. If you decide not to continue with a membership, you won‚Äôt lose access to anything you have already purchased.
As a thank you for being a dedicated member of the FitXR community, you will receive a 90-day free trial. This means you‚Äôll have access to all of your original workouts alongside everything that FitXR membership has to offer including seven new classes added each week and regular product improvements. We‚Äôre also introducing a new HIIT studio featuring High-Intensity Interval Training classes very soon. 
After this trial period, if you decide not to proceed with membership, your account will be reverted back to how it was before the upgrade. This means you‚Äôll still have access to all of the content you had previously, alongside any DLC packs you‚Äôve purchased ‚Äì and you will still be able to play multiplayer sessions.

So I definitely keep the base game plus any DLC‚Äôs I‚Äôve bought forever? 
Sam ‚ÄòYes!. The FitXR base game and any purchased DLC packs will remain yours forever regardless of if you join and later cancel your membership‚Äô.

1161,ncharity,10/5/2002 0:00,2,An app I won't buy for several reasons,"Note this is an updated review.
My previous review was written straight after a very frustrating experience with this app. I should have left more time for the frustration to have worn off to give the company some serious feedback.
1. The timing on the hooks and the uppercuts is completely off (or it requires more power than I am ready to provide at this stage of my training - or at my age), so it is really difficult to get a run going.
2. On top of that I find myself accidentally clicking on the buttons while I box, so the games keeps on pausing. This would be so simple to correct.
3. Dreadful generic music. I realise that this very subjective and that improving the music will result in more costs.
This led my experience to be very frustrating and un-fun.
I would like to know if the company is aware of problems 1 and 2, as in essence this is a good game that I would be prepared to pay properly for in a monthly subscription, but not in the form it is currently in. Desperately trying to not break a run of punches and not succeeding because the jab and uppercut timing is off and in frustration always ending up always activating the pause - not my idea of fun. Pity."
1162,Musicman,"Sep 21, 2021 at 1:08 AM",5,Great fitness App!,I have had this app for over a year now. I love the new HITT feature. It gives me more of a workout than the previous boxing mode.

1166,WyellEss,10/27/2002 0:00,3,Great variety but rubbish subscription,"As a non-gym goer looking to improve my fitness through active games fitxr really ticks a lot of boxes. It's well developed, fun, has catchy music, many class options and navigation is fairly easy. I like that there is a range of activities (box, hiit and dance - well, not the dance, tried once and found it very difficult to follow), music styles, difficulty levels and different session lengths to suit your needs and time constraints.  There's a lot of choice. 

HOWEVER, I'm with many other original buyers. I was not impressed at the bait and switch from a one-time purchase with bolt on options to a fairly expensive (~$15/month) subscription, take it or leave it. I know the developers put in an effort to provide new content regularly, befitting of a subscription model, but I just don't use the app enough to benefit (I generally stick to the box sessions for warm up before sports and never have time for more than a quick session here and there). 

New offerings can also be a double edged sword as there are more sessions than I'll  ever have time to flick through and many start looking indistinguishable (I've also head the same music in a number of different sessions). WHY SHOULD I PAY FOR NEW CONTENT I DON'T USE UNDER SUBSCRIPTION? 

While I'm trying the subscription right now to access the app, I question whether it's worth continuing, as the costs seem to outweigh the benefits. 

There are other well rated fitness apps out there which don't need a subscription model (i.e. users can just purchase thhe new content they are interested in via a bolt on pack). I hear that the developers have taken on board feedback from their dissatisfied original user base and are offering some of the original packs outside of subscription, so will stick around a bit longer and see. I completely disagree with your stance on the subscription model being the right choice, however - I know the development team should be rewarded for their efforts but, given the relative formulaic nature of the content and the ongoing cost, I can't see it as being any more than a money grab.

(A final whinge: I didn't even get the full benefit of the consolation 90 day trial as my quest controller broke and it took ages to get a replacement, making the day the subsciption requirement kicked in a particularly bitter pill to swallow)"

With Fitxr it‚Äôs just easy to do a short exercise, and I can see on my activity monitor on my wrist that I am really getting a high pulse like 150 bpm.
I love the boxing, it is so much better than regular thai boxing classes, as you get the response from the controllers.
That being said, I love that they added Dance and HIIT as it can get tedious doikg the same thing all the time."

1179,Sean,"Sep 17, 2021 at 6:56 PM",1,Excellent - Was Before‚Ä¶.,"VR in general is changing the way we game!  This specific ‚Äúgame‚Äù I don‚Äôt even consider a game. This is a true fitness program and if you hate going to the gym but want to get in shape.... buy this game! Work out for fun with Beatsaber... then get ready for VR Boxer!!  The game mechanics are truly impressive. I used to box and the punch mechanics are precise. In fact, the quicker and more real you throw that punch, the higher the score! I‚Äôve gotten 90 on a lazy thrown hook and 600 on excellent form and quickness! Great workout and make sure you stretch!

Update: I purchased Box VR which was completely different game that I ranked 5/5 The new subscription model and issues are reason for my updated poor rating. I think if developers are truly reading this, offer both. Offer the classic Box VR and let existing owners choose that if unhappy. You do have some happy subscribers with Fit XR so continue to grow that separate audience at same time growing or winning back people with Box VR. Allow users to connect to YouTube or something to play their own music if you need to downgrade that part of Box VR. I think offering both platforms would improve ratings and eliminate the bait and switch comments."

This game has now unorganised menues with no search engine to find what you want to train, no randomised multiplayer lobbies with people playing. I want the old game back which I payed for not this terrible game. This game is now truly not worth a dime. It truly went from one of the best training games on the quest to the worst!!!  Make the last update disappear and get back the old game before more people will give you terrible reviews.

I was curious to try the HIIT classes but with only being able to track hands, the exercises are so boring and repetitive the work out is thoroughly underwhelming. I disliked the dance workouts for this reason as well. For boxing, for some reason they don't seem to have any options under 8 minutes anymore which is a shame because I liked to repeat three minute videos over and over to see if I could beat my time (starting a workout with one and ending with the same one). I was open to the idea of using a subscription service if it was worth it since I don't feel super comfortable joining a gym or workout studio right now in the pandemic, but this is definitely not a good option."

He has multiple health issues and lives basically like a hermit. But when I offered him my Quest, he took to all of the fitness apps head on. He couldn't get over that he could get even just a small 15 minute workout per day in a game-like immersive environment and never have to leave the house. He enjoys the fitness he gets in apps such as ""Thrill Of The Fight"" and using the dojo in ""Vader Immortal III"". He decided to give FitXR a trial run and he immediately loved it and now pays for the 8,50 euro a month subscription on my account.

Now they charge a monthly fee to access almost all the workouts. What a rip off!!! I paid my money for the game and now can't even play. It takes so much time to find a workout that I can actually play, I spend more time searching than working out.

1247,Juan,10/4/2002 0:00,3,Can be much better,"It has potential, but being a direct competitor to supernatural is hard to make a case to get a subscription for this app when the other is so superior, even with the price difference. I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but as a mixed reality dev I feel like I have to. The stutter, lag, and poor user experience are unacceptable for a 10 dollar subscription‚Äî fixing these issues should be priority for the developers instead of releasing daily workouts. On the other hand, content is good and workouts are also enjoyable, however the virtual trainers just break the immersion horribly. If you can‚Äôt show a decent enough character model, just replace it with some generic avatar or something that is less disturbing to the eye."

1261,Mangybs,"Aug 31, 2021 at 11:53 PM",5,The Negative Reviews Make No Sense,"I purchased this product as a full game and have had a wide variety of workouts to choose from since. I have never been forced to pay a sub to access the content, it does ask if I'd like to but there are plenty of workouts to choose from for people who paid for the full game. 

Changing your business model isn't always shady, and they seem to have taken care to make sure they left their previous customers plenty of content to choose from. This workout app does a lot to keep you engaged and has more options than Supernatural. If you want to mix up your workouts, doing boxing, dancing, and more this is a great choice. If you want to play a different version of Beatsaber get Supernatural, which isn't bad but you get less options for some better scenery."

Then they updated and became a subscription type of game which I think is unfair. You do not have to subscribe if you don't want to, if you have bought some of the packs before or the original ones which came with the game. I personally think they should go back to how it was, and you could buy the packs as you wish.

Other than that it is a great exercise experience, and made it very easy to exercise during corona times when the gym was closed. I get up my heart beat, sweat and was pretty soar after the first workouts.
It is easy to grasp the concept of what you are supposed to do, and you get a full body workout."

1271,Yamabushido,"Aug 23, 2021 at 3:20 PM",1,"Paid for the DLC app, NOT a subscription","Ammended due to the outrageous con of switching to subscription on a paid app. So the new environments are going to be not given to those customers who built and supported this franchise? The HIIT not for customers? The option to buy DLCs are now removed... not for customers? Unbelievable.
We don't want your $120/year subscription or trial of a subscription. This is no consolation for those who paid for an app and are now seeing development and updates diverted to subscription model. Shame on you and Facebook for allowing it. 1 star.
The alleged upgrades are either missing (no HIIT), or downgrades. The text is now too small to read and less clear. Class selection is a UX fail. Filtering absent. Squats off option, an extra unnecessary step - a backward step for UX. The high-end gym lobby is removed and replaced with a dingey bleak cave. The gym classes photographics are worse. The hit registration is SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE. Of all these downgrades, amongst a bait and switch rip-off that is now the company's known modus operandi, the multiplayer alone is additional. Personally, that's completely useless and irrelevant.
EDIT - If the subscription is optional, then we opt out: return our money and update the app for existing customers to the functionality and DLC updates that was described and we have paid for. It's not optional and you're conning your own customerbase. Worse you've done it before.
 PSA: After reading others advice, I have successfully been refunded even 4 months after I paid. So, SEEK REFUND with Support now for your money back. I suggest everyone seeks a refund and joins a nearing THIRD of ratings, and still growing, now 1 star. Be keeping an eye out for this company as one to completely avoid in future.
For alternatives X-booster on App Labs (currently free) seems a better alternative with greater potential and more varied and entertaining workout mechanics. They're going to get my money which would have gone to this company."

1281,Nicolas Hoffmann,"Aug 24, 2021 at 7:33 AM",1,Honest review,"After a full month of using this app, from Monday to Friday I can tell you:
- The lack of music in a rhythm based workout it makes me lose motivation so quickly. (Example: five to six different workout routines I've done, from 15 to 45 minutes the ""victorious"" song is there...and it's soooooo bad). 
- One song always will have the exact same routine, so it becomes monotonous. (And it makes me doubt about your ""professional personal trainers"")
- the Extreme Pack it's way to far from extreme, there's some ""free songs"" more extreme than those. Put that money in the game thrill of the fight, it would last way more than this DLC.
I will keep this review in 2 stars, because of the cost of this app and the DLC compared to my benefits. I can go up if I see any changes in the normal version, because I will no put more money on DLC's.

Have fun until you will get bored with the music.

Edit: 
I can barely see what to do right now, with all The  membership crap going on, can't even tell what's the actual part of the game that I paid for.

I tried to do a workout...but finished closing the app disgusted on how they try to push this membership crap on your face...going down to one star."

I give 4 stars for what I have now. A good workout tool for boxing moves. The hiit classes seems to be fine, but I prefer the boxing classes. The dance classes are too hard and I  play dance central with kinect a lot.

Could be 5 stars with more studios and a option to create a playlist of sections so I can play for one hour, for example.

As a subscription, I give 2 stars. Is simply too expensive for what offers. Only 3 studios, a lot of sections but no playlist, not too much variation in the boxing classes considering moviment. The number of classes are huge. If you plan to use it for 2 hours a day, it is works the 9 a month. For casual use it is too expensive in my opinion."

I hate it when devs convert one-time payment products into subscription services. I'm not going to stand for it.

TO THE DEVELOPERS (UPDATE 5)
Way to double-double-down in the wrong direction. You insult your original, rightfully unhappy, customers claiming they aren't ""real"" customers, now you're BRIBING people to increase your ratio of FAKE 5 star reviews. Perhaps it's time for trading standards to REALLY get involved.

UPDATE 1
I've contacted the CAB, they advise me that under UK law the developers CANNOT do this. They say:

""UK law states that digital content must match the description and functionality advertised on purchase. These rights come from the Consumer Rights Act 2015.""

This should not have replaced BoxVR.

UPDATE 2 
I've reached out to Oculus asking them to remove this product from my account. I just want to end my relationship with this bad faith actor once and for all. Even when an expert has told them they're violating consumer rights and trading standards in their own country, they insist they aren't.  

This developer has abused their position on the Oculus store more than once and will continue to do so. 

UPDATE 3
This developer is now calling anyone posting public reviews not ""real"" customers. So instead of fixing the problems, they're insulting us. Steer clear of this ""game"". Don't make the same mistake we did here.

UPDATE 4
Oculus have now told me they cannot remove products from accounts. They also won't refund because I bought when it was BoxVR. However, they did give me partial store credit as compensation.

If enough people ask for the same, maybe Oculus will be forced to improve how they handle this in the future.

Steer clear of the fake 5* reviews. This developer is trying to scam you."

They have introduced a subscription for access to classes even though  I paid full price for the game a few months ago. There are very few free class options and they are impossible to find. So much so that I don‚Äôt bother to use it anymore. 
Also the game has become more glitchy with every update. The devs of this game don‚Äôt care about it or it‚Äôs core user base. It pure corporate greed and they expect people to not be angry that the game a lot of people paid for is now useless. I wouldn‚Äôt buy any more games from this developer."

Well, I still love it, I love that they added HIIT, I love that they added multi-player.  The subscription thing is annoying but everything is subscription-based now.

How about upping the intensity in FitXR and have  Advanced+ classes which would be more challenging"
1303,CadmiumYellow,"Aug 16, 2021 at 3:46 AM",1,(updated) Huge bait and switch,"I tried the game a while ago when it was still BoxVR on a free weekend, loved it and eventually purchased it. Overall it's fun. Recently tho, they completely overhauled the game and other than the core gameplay, it no longer resembles what I payed originally payed for.

-First off, you need to give your email to create a FitXR account. Why?
-There is multiplayer but it's not real/live. I found out when I had to pause the game once and everything and everyone froze until I unpaused.
-Hit detection feels worse.
-You can't change the stage.
-Time is moved to the edge of the peripheral making it hard to see mid game.
-No more in game calorie counter
-No more custom playlists
-The flashing rings on good hits get annoying on longer sessions or when there are big clusters of beats
-They changed the categorization of the songs and it's really not intuitive. (It used to be sorted by length now it's just random until you set filters)
-Worse thing for me is they changed the scoring system. If you don't hit a beat hard enough it breaks your combo, which no other rhythm game ever does. You have to really hit hard to maintain combo and for someone who's not that fit it's really demotivating to have a perfectly reasonable hit when you start to get tired and have it not count. This maybe why hit detection feel worse since every punch I'm focusing on speed and sacrifice accuracy

Overall it feels like one of those Facebook or YouTube pages that got sold off and is just trying to be cool

Edit: hit detection is definitely worse, I saw my hand go straight thru a note multiple times and it didn't count

Edit 2: after accepting the offer to revert back to BoxVR I must admit that overall, FitXR is a step in the right direction, despite the terrible launch strategy, and changing of the combo counter. Discounting the removal of all the aforementioned features and the cosmetic changes the core gameplay is definitely an improvement.

Edit 3: So while changing almost nothing about the game and barely addressing any of the issues, they've pulled the 2nd bait and switch. Now they have moved to a subscription model, completely yanking the rug out of the people who payed for the game. All while not offering a refund but instead 90 day ""free"" trial. They‚Äôve essentially tricked us into paying for 3 months subscription. I no longer trust this developer and suggest you don't either.

Edit 4: so my ""free"" subscription period has ended but I haven't played in a month or so. I come back, and these guys have changed the game again! I can't even find a course with the gameplay that convinced me to buy this game 3 or 4 overhauls ago. The new courses promote speed over form and that could lead to strains or injury. The filter system is garbage and the sorting system makes no sense. They just keep changing the game. BUYER BEWARE. What you get now will  not be what you get 2 or 3 months from now....Oh, and did I mention that they never added any of the original features they removed after almost a year and promising they would? That's kinda important to my still boiling outrage to this dev and this game."

At first it can seem daunting, but as your brain begins to make the necessary neurological connections between sight and sound, your timing and accuracy will invariably improve...and once that happens you‚Äôll be hitting  those targets with ease. Want to crank it up a notch? Do what I did and add weighted gloves...talk about a workout! 

This program primarily focuses on shoulders, arms and abdominal muscles, with some legs by way of squats, but the true magic lies in how many calories you‚Äôll burn! Not sure if you can tell, but I LOVE BOXVR and so will you...just remember: practice makes perfect. Don‚Äôt give up and eventually you‚Äôll be punching like a champ!

Pro Tip: watch a YouTube video on proper striking techniques, it‚Äôll go a long way toward improving your experience and results. Punches thrown: Jab - Cross - Uppercut - Hook

This game is how I justified buying a quest and I have not regretted the purchase whatsoever. Even if the quest could only play this game, I would probably still buy it. It is important to note that if you are looking for a ""game game"" something like beatsaber would probably serve you better as this is game is more focused on exercise than entertainment.. this is not to say it's not fun just that entertainment value is not the primary focus here. Would hope the developer keeps supporting the game in the future with new tracks and workout regimens, and would love to see a tracklist and genre listing option in the workout selection screen. An option to load our own tracks would be really amazing, even if it has to be done through sidequest like with beatsaber."
1312,ICarverI,"Aug 19, 2021 at 7:48 PM",1,Subscription,I purchased the app for ¬£23.99 awhile ago now and it's been great. the classes were good and a good way to burn calories at home. Now they've switch to a ¬£8.99 monthly subscription and I feel it's a kick in the teeth as I've already made a one time purchase. Completely ruined the experience for me and i will no longer be using the app.
1313,PangelaB,"Sep 29, 2021 at 2:43 PM",3,Expensive,To be honest I used to enjoy this game in the beginning but all of the workouts are quite repetitive. When you released the HIIT I got excited but it turned out I have to pay subscription 9.99 per month which is insane... Well I gave it a try and as much as I loved it in the beginning it gets quite boring because basically it is the same moves in every workout.. the music could also be better and maybe an idea to add different gloves/colours to make the game more attractive?
1314,eris404,"Aug 19, 2021 at 6:49 AM",1,"Basic functions broken, ruined good game","I liked much of the initial changes when BoxXR went to FitXR. The new environments were fun, I seemed to have better hit detection (despite losing the glove adjust feature), and it was really second only to Thrill of the Fight for getting my heart rate up. I recently reloaded for the first time since the subscription switch and am shocked at how far backwards the game has gone. 

Nearly all customization is gone. Menus are more difficult to navigate, without previously clear filtering options. Even the basic rendering resolution of the game is much lower, forcing me to quit and test other games to make sure my headset wasn‚Äôt glitching. Frame rates are inconsistent‚Ä¶ the game is, in my opinion, unplayable in this current state, and I‚Äôm very dissatisfied I can‚Äôt reinstall the ‚Äúless mature‚Äù version of this software I bought."
1315,getawayguide,"Sep 25, 2021 at 10:10 PM",4,Nice variety,"I just did my free week trial and I am ok with the $9.99 monthly. Cheaper than a gym and cheaper than Supernatural which has limited variety of activities. I really like the boxing in FitVR and I would like to see more environments and more activities, maybe fencing (swords) and Tai Chi. 

It seems odd to promote pictures of trainers but never see them in the activity. Just pick a cool voice or two and lose the fake pretty fitness ""experts"". 

It would be nice to have more 10min sessions in each activity at each level. It is sometimes hard to commit to more than 10 or 15 min everyday on a single app. I mix up my workout between four apps now with this one. 

On the whole, I think it is a great app and experience. Keep it going stronger."

My alternatives, from the applab 

- X-Booster

- Song Beater


Update 7.7.21

I think X-Booster is the closest you can get to the OLD and GOOD BOXVR (aka FitXR) experience"
1318,LuvinLife,"Aug 21, 2021 at 7:25 PM",1,"Was a fan, not now, not worth $$/month","2nd update since ‚Äòfree‚Äô membership stopped:  The my classes option works to screen free ones, but I am still missing workouts that I had using the original version. Where are the previous ones for Angel??  Now only 1 is unlocked and I had several pre-subscription change.  Fixed the favorites that were appearing.  Now bring back the previous content. Still cannot recommend this app for the monthly cost when others like Song Beater, PowerBeats, Synth Riders, etc. have custom songs, maps, etc. for free.

Update: After trying to use this version, I am rolling back a star because of the filter function and scrolling. Put the previous filters back on the home page and allow 10 options like before. Bug when clearing filter, going home and then back in all filters are kept in place. Also, do put back a gym home interface vs the dark moon setting. I'm trying to work through it, but new interface is clunky.

Previously:  I was a fan of FitXR, it was setup to be different than many of the other similar motion apps I actively use in that it was like walking into a gym with a nice option menu. I would roll-back this version until the new interface can be enhanced to be user-friendly. The initial screen you now see is a gloomy place and then the next screen after you select the account is missing all of the filters I actively used every time I used the app. I can get the same activity level using other apps with less interruption between songs and better visuals with no fees. If I was in the developers position for this app, I would bring back a version of the upscale gym environment with all of the previous filter functions, ability to view the number of workouts and personal stats you could then and have the ability to turn specific workout squats on/off without going into a sub-menu. For people who may use this as their primary workout, develop a VIP section that has different options and added workouts. Other apps allow more function without fees."

Oculus store is that becoming the scammers gateway to quick cash.

I'm not saying fitXr sub isn't worth it at the old price but I'm hesitating at the new price

EDIT: update on this. It appears oculus caused this sub and this sub only to be advertised and charged in foreign currency so it appeared cheaper. Everything else is in my native currency.  FitXR did also send me advertising that didn't specify USD. I'm not sure how this happened but I didn't notice because 8 didn't scrutinise my PayPal transactions item by item. So it appears like a price hike but isn't.
Some glitchy tech here. Also my sub fails on the last day of my month probably due to timezone. FitXR and oculus are now working with me on this. Hopefully the issue will be fixed. Still not sure about the value for money but you absolutely have to pay something for constant new content. This is right on the borderline... The content is certainly there though."

After the most recent update however it has become ridiculously slow to load. I timed it at 27mins to load the login screen from starting the application and that was after clearing the cache and rebooting the quest. It was similar while using several different WiFi hotspots. I also uninstalled and reinstalled the application

The developers really need to listen to the community because this is ruining the studios reputation. Considering g that a lot of people subscribe to this application and pay money you would think the severe shortcomings would be treated with upmost urgency. 

I will be uninstalling this now. I only wish there was a way to block the app from showing on my store feed and I find it offensive even seeing it. 

Do yourself a favour and download thrill of the fight instead"

Last year it was working fine no issues at all. Then they rebranded and started a subscription service and that's when thing started to go downhill. The issues I have are:

1) The game will randomly stutter which has an impact on not only your score but more importantly the in game experience. 
2) The graphics in the main menu are horrendous. The whole menu is just a blurry mess. It's worse then when you  try to view really old standard definition films on a high definition TV.  The text is just horrible to read
3) The graphics whilst working out need working on. Whilst the majority is fine there are still some jagged edges in certain parts. 
4) When I look down at where my feet are supposed to be the feet I'm game are higher off the ground 

The game overall is just a horrible now I can't deal with the menu screen it's so bad. This game is definitely not worth the subscription cost."

1326,Ashley,"Aug 12, 2021 at 7:03 AM",1,I tried so hard to work with this app,"I started using FITXR before the subscription nonsense. Thought it was a great deal. I used to work out with my sister who lives long distance, so it was great. It had some bugs, but overall was worth the 30 something bucks I spent on it. Then, the subscription model was introduced. Those of us who had the app before were grandfathered in to their ""new and improved"" app experience for a limited time before we had to start paying for the subscription. I was cool with that, and intended to pay for the subscription. However, when I went to sign up for the subscription, the app would not let me subscribe. I tried multiple times, updated my headset and the app, etc. Nothing worked. I've never had to try so hard to have someone else take my money. I gave it my all to sign up for a subscription, but it just wasn't happening. My sister and I have since canceled the app and will look for something new. Great idea in theory, but constant updates, paywalls with no subscription (and no way to upgrade) ultimately drove me away. I do not recommend to anyone who is genuinely interested in getting a good workout and getting into shape. You'll spend a lot of time updating, configuring sound, and mics. You may also find that you can't subscribe even if you want to!"
1327,Chelsey,"Aug 12, 2021 at 6:57 AM",1,Do NOT recommend!,What I thought was fun at first turned into constant updates and glitches and even with the updates the game itself can‚Äôt keep track of your punches accurately.

But, then, came the change to compete with the glitz of BeatSaber. Punch targets were just weird, background scenes were deleted - a downgrade but I put up with it.

Then, on the Quest, yet another version where they advertised custom mp3 support and some other stuff I don't remember. That never worked - the app was hard to use and didn't work half the time. Still called BoxVR.

Then!  Came the first FitXR version that we had no choice but to install because Oculus' platform is full 1995 quality.  This version looked fancy but was a completely different game from BoxVR. Always required internet, for the most part, and now sported screechy trainers!  Woohoo

And finally, the subscription based version you see now.  All of these changes to an app sold on Oculus' platform are apparently perfectly ok with them.  They got their money, who cares.  Just weak on the part of the developer and of Oculus.

Meh.  1/10 wouldn't do again."

While I do like FitXR, it just makes me sad I can't pay for it once and just use it forever, like any other game. The season pass model works way better than this anyway, it has been proven. Why not make the core of the game accessible to everyone for one sum of money, and then add seasonal content you can pay for? I hate the way this has been handled, the rest of the reviews tell it all. I believe a business needs to be profitable, but you can't tell me how the previous model wasn't profitable. At this point you're just milking your customers. Shameless"
1339,LawD Jay,"Sep 3, 2021 at 3:45 PM",4,Update - currently trying,"Update,

I reached out to both Oculus and fit XR, and they were able to resolve my 'insufficient rights' issue.  This is a pretty good app, that I enjoy using, and it is better than it's predecessor boxvr.  The powered meter is an upgrade and the there are more tracks.  The boxing mechanics are done very well, and while HIIT is hit or miss for me, it isn't bad at all.  The question is whether or not it's worth the subscription price? Personally, I think it is, for the right person.  If you have the original boxvr, have a subscription for another exercise app, or just don't like being on the hook for a monthly fee, then it probably isn't worth it.  If you don't fall into those categories, and are looking for an app for VR that will assist with your cardio, take a look at fitxr. Personally, I won't be paying the subscription at this time, as I have the original boxvr, and a subscription service to a different VR fitness app which I like better than fitxr (I fall into the first 2 categories that I spoke of)."
1340,Carl,"Sep 13, 2021 at 10:25 PM",4,Great workout!,"I recently purchased an Oculus, for the fitness features.  I am older, and wanted something that would keep me engaged.  I downloaded several fitness related apps, but have gravitated to FitXR, for the quality of the workout.  I don't have much interest in the Dance workouts, and have limited my workouts to Boxing with a little HIIT mixed in.  I love the Boxing workouts.  So much fun.  I used to dread working out, but now I look forward to it, sometimes making time for 2-3 boxing workouts in a day.  It's challenging, entertaining, and more of a cardio workout that I ever imagined.  
The format for the HIIT workouts are kind of hinky, having to follow along with a virtualized trainer.  Here I think that SuperNatural has an upper had with real trainers showing you thru a workout.  This is one of the reasons I held back a star.  The other reason is the format for trying to find a workout.  All levels are jumbled into a large selection of workouts, so if you are a beginner, you have to work thru a lot of other workouts to see all the ones rated for that level.  Maybe add a radio button for beginner intermediate and advanced so you can quickly see what is available for the level you are currently at.  
In the future, maybe have an option to upload your own music for the workouts too.  That would give infinite variety to the workouts."

This is unacceptable for a vr game where I can't even look at anything else while I wait. Lots of broken or missing pictures in the menu. Clunky and not easy to read text. I started the free trial but there is no easy way to manage my subscription. It should be found in one place like the Oculus app. The same way one would manage their subscriptions on Google play. 

The actual gameplay is fun. I like that you play with other people in a class to keep you competitive. By the end I feel like I've had a real work out and it was fun. The four types of classes are different enough that it would take a while to get bored of. 
The scores and levels also keep me motivated. Could be improved with some achievements or rewards. 

Overall this game is not worth a subscription. I would pay 15 for the whole thing and then more for add on packs like Beat Saber."

I decided to go to the reviews to see if anyone else had this problem. I saw the recent bad reviews on having to pay a subscription. Of course that was disappointing but still had to check it out myself. It finally worked and yes, a subscription was added and gives you a free trial. Well it so says that you get to use all the older workouts if you decide not to subscribe and it doesn't auto subscribe.  I tried the workouts. I did 9 mins and 5 mins of these new workouts and I'm soaked. I don't think it's a bad idea if you're subscribing and getting new workouts daily.

I know it has some bugs (although right now I only see one: burned calories calculation sometimes is 0) and that the UX is not the best, but they have improved it adding filters.

For me, it has a lot of potential now that they will have more incomes from the app. Yes, I know subscriptions are not the best thing in the world, but if they can promise better music, environments and new functionalities (why not yoga, meditation or full body workouts?) it can worth the effort!

Suggestion: why not being able to filter by intensity on a first level? If you‚Äôre releasing one workout per day sooner than later it‚Äôs going to be difficult to find out the perfect one! And why can‚Äôt we preview the included songs or make a custom playlist as you did on your previous app?

The original game was a DLC model. If you wanted more content, you made a 1 time DLC purchase. We all bought the game knowing and accepting this was the model for additional content.
 
Subscriptions are nothing more than a cheap cash grab by greedy developers. Instead of purchasing new songs/classes, people are now expected to rent them. And the moment they stop paying, they stop playing. 

Along with offline play and custom workouts, we lost access to the game model we purchased. Knowing players will eventually get bored of repeating the same classes over and over again, you‚Äôve attempted to fleece them into a subscription model by removing the alternatives from the original game."

The app may not be the most optimised out there (nees to put my headset in English in order it to boot and i am finnish) but the music alone is worth it. Think about it. They put great tracks on the classes and music tempo and genre vary. I have found new artists from the playlist etc. They charge 9.99 per month. We have two adult users so 5 each? What do i get with that. I get a real challenge and sweat. 26 minutes of boxin is hard with controllers acting like small weights. Silicon face cover is must with this game. MUSTHAVE! Then why the 4 stars? Well you wouldnt read 5 stars reviews and there were bugs on the firstplaytrough and the monthly payment (needed to put visa again to oculus app GDPR bank stuff) so minus 1 star for those reasons.

There was some development as a new mode, one new environment and the option to turn off having your combo stop if you don't hit hard enough. So surely but slowly some trust was won back. Now that trust has been broken again, which I would not recommend spending money on this app. Its interface can change completely, previous available content might not be available to purchase any more. This app was part of my weekly routine and I tried on it, but going through this twice has had me lose complete faith in this developer. Your customer base and their feedback should be your most important asset, but time and experience have learned this isn't the case here. Fool me once..."

1361,Rose,"Aug 30, 2021 at 2:43 PM",4,Great workout,So I downloaded this game a few days ago and I have yet to be able to get the 7 day free trial. I tried on the app and it says I don‚Äôt have permission. I looked at all the settings and there is nothing to change to make this work. I get emails telling me to start my trial and when I click on it I‚Äôm directed to the oculus app on my phone but there is nowhere to start the trial. I‚Äôve read all the reviews but most of them are related to buying the app and then it being changed to  subscription and people getting mad. I‚Äôve  only been able to do the free workouts but I do love those. Just wish I could actually subscribe.

Then they updated it to a subscription model, and seemingly made everything worse as well? I really wish the dance mode was fun, but it‚Äôs aggravating and annoying. And I wish there were more environments. Oh yeah, and the avatars you can choose from are only male-looking, wtf? 

This would have been a good 3-4 stars if they had not done the bait & switch. Not cool"

1367,Eightbears,"Jul 19, 2021 at 11:28 AM",1,Shady business practice,"Haven‚Äôt play this game for a long time and come back to see them changing a lot. The most annoying thing is that they changed to a subscription model. The reason I bought this game in the first place is that it was a pay one time and that‚Äôs it type of game. Sure, existing users can keep what we have before but that also means they are not gonna give a crap abt existing users in the future. Pretty much forcing people to buy that monthly subscription if we want new content. If I want a monthly subscription fitness game, I will buy Supernatural with better graphic and sound.

The UI also changed to a piece of useless crap. Like who on earth thinks it‚Äôs a good idea to remove the filter?? Also can‚Äôt even tell how long each class is without clicking into it. Hello? Hire a better UX designer please.  

The new hiit classes are fun tho."

1369,Chris,"Aug 26, 2021 at 8:07 AM",4,Great boxing workouts,"I do one explosive beginner boxing workout workout per week and 1 advanced workout on training mode.

It‚Äôs really not a polished experience. The songs are often mediocre and the UI is hard to use - it is downright painful to navigate through lists of workouts. But it works for me! Just don‚Äôt expect a soundtrack at the level of Beat Saber, which I play several times per week.

As for other users that are upset about the switch to a subscription model, I understand the frustration, but as a software developer myself, I understand the difficulty of supporting legacy payment models forever. Please understand folks that the VR space is very new and a subscription model shows a commitment to earn your satisfaction every month. I also use Apple‚Äôs Fitness+ and it‚Äôs clear to me that fresh, updated workouts with my favorite trainers keeps me motivated.

But that leads me to my biggest complaint about the app. Each class is supposedly led by an instructor, but you never see them, instead just hearing some canned sound clips from a library. In that sense it is far inferior to Apple Fitness+ - to demonstrate this, off the top of my head, I know the names of my two favorite coaches, Tyrell and Jessica.

Another suggestion to the developers - muscle-wise, the boxing workouts aren‚Äôt balanced. To supplement, I do explosive overhand throwing motions and backwards elbow jabs."

But as a new user, I'm happy with the free classes that the game comes with. Perfect for those who want to do exercise but lack the motivation. This game makes it fun and competitive as there are other players fighting to get the best score on the leaderboard. 

I haven't tried the subscription yet so I don't know if it's worth it, but so far this is the best fitness game I've found for Oculus Quest."

What is going on???"
1375,Hepcat Mike,"Jun 24, 2021 at 11:34 PM",1,SCAM:Return custom playlists WE PAID FOR,"When I bought BoxVR, custom playlists with your own imported music were part of the package. They weren't perfect since they were generated on the fly, and the manual install was clunky -  but they were workouts that motivated me on a personal level in a way that all your pre-recorded coaching and Everything-Sounds-The-Same Garage Band programmed Electronica or fad-of-the-moment pop tunes can't. 

Cramming in more stuff nobody asked for while simultaneously removing functions they have already paid for is the worst. 

Give me back my money or give me the functionality I already paid for and for God's sake get the targets in sync with the music. This was my go to workout app and for all your fiddling with it of late, it's worse now.

But on to the review of the ""updates""

The updates are pathetic, trying desperately to keep up with the stellar Supernatural fitness app but falling far, far short of the mark. The coaches' character models look like they were programmed by an uninspired teenager trying to get an art project done at the last minute. 

Timing of targets to the beat of the music remains a challenge even with update after update. Come on, folks - Beat Saber predates the old BoxVR and they got it right at launch. Work out when the music and the targets don't match? How do you even do such a thing? It's like paying an aerobics instructor who is consistently put of rhythm with the music.  You'd fire than instructor. 

Dance workouts miss the mark with the music and animation out of sync, uninspired movement and absolutely generic character models. The one positive I can give is that the weak generic instructor avatars at least have some people who aren't white. Thank you for that diversity. 

The new interval target punching game thing is just weak. This may have looked good on paper but it feels tacked on, like the ""free bonus software"" that comes installed on a new phone. You know, the apps you never use and eventually uninstall.

I loved BoxVR. I enjoyed the changes to FitXR early on (to a degree) but the latest update has made it a chore to use. Between the menus no longer being intuitive and the timing / sync issues somehow getting worse instead of better, I'll be spending my money with the Supernatural fitness app, which is stellar and a fantastic example of getting what you pay for."

1379,Leighton,"Jul 17, 2021 at 5:45 AM",4,BoxVr and FitXr should be separate games,"I bought this game when it was BoxVR. It had some solid routines and it had very few glitches that I could see. It was great cardio, awesome music, and workouts for pretty much every level of fitness.  They then changed the game entirely instead of making a new game or a sequel.  BoxVR became FitXR. 

FitXR introduced some cool features and workouts, but I did not purchase FiTXR, I purchased BoxVR.  I like both games, but I should still be able to keep the game I purchased.  This was more than just an update, it is an entirely new game. I am fine with having a subscription service,  I subscribe to one of the VR bike services. I would gladly switch subscription s to FitXR, but It is hard to trust a company that would just completely change the software they sold you. The workouts are solid and do the job, but the company failed it's customers. And I know you can keep all old purchases, but where is the original lobby, and original backgrounds? I purchased those by purchasing BoxVR.  If they are willing to do this, what will they do with subscription pricing?"

1381,Joona Juvonen,"Aug 19, 2021 at 2:37 PM",4,Great game with bad change management,"Update - August 2021 - From 5 to 1 to 4 stars after great support experience from FitXr. None of the previously bought content is gone, but they are not exposed using the ""My Classes"" button during the initial 90 day trial... 

Unfortunately this seems like an awesome example of expectation and change management. Game itself is awesome, but the May change from the DLC based model to subscription model caused reaction as the previously owned classes are not clearly anymore visible - which apparently is the experience ONLY during the 90 day trial period. It gets better after that, if you don't subscribe with My Classes option. 

Sure - the DLC model is gone, but game in general will get updates and those updates of course also improve the overall experience regardless of being in old model or with subscription model. 

All previously bought content is still there and subscription model is not mandatory. Unfortunately that was not clearly communicated as the new model was introduced.

Four stars are because of the confusing menu model. Previous selection model of the classes was much better, but I'm sure this is getter updated also in future.

***** - 5 stars on the support team quality.

March 2021 - Really enjoyed this one with daily exercise on different trainings. This is what VR is all about."

1384,Decedwolf,"May 29, 2021 at 7:45 PM",1,I'm very disappointed in this company,"I want to make one thing clear I think this is an amazing game with that said I think the devs have no right to to make the game subscription based and their 90 day free trial to ""reward loyalty  of its previous customers"" sounds like an add for something that should have been free if I pay 30 USD for a game I should have a right to access any improvement they make and leting you keep all the content you previously had sounds like they're just trying not to get in trouble by oculus and or Facebook and they wouldn't if they didn't have too it feels like they're trying to scam there customers for more and more money 
To sum up my point this is a very fun game and I'm very disappointed in this company and sad that I can't write a 5 star review like a wanted to I'm sure something like this will happen again and that's why I'm recommending anyone reading this review to try another vr fitness game


Update 
I found the devs response to be insulting at best  the devs obvious didn't read my review also I waited a month to try their hit classes (witch should have been on as soon as the sub model launched) and they're still not there and with the way this company has been treating its paying customers I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't come on until the 3 months trial is over I think this app has great potential but I can't tolerate a company thinking that they can rip-off paying customers like this and I just wish I could get a refund

HIIT update 

I wanted to say I tried the Hitt class and honestly I can see how someone may like it but I can't stand it I hate how poorly animated the trainer is 
and I just didn't have fun witch is a main selling point for a vr workout 

Also I think the fake 4-5 star reviews are  despicable and oculus/Facebook need to stop them"
1385,DarkestDesires93,"Jul 29, 2021 at 3:44 PM",5,Makes working out fun,"I just got into this app, the price you pay per month is reasonable in my opinion, it's the same price as going to the gym in my area and I don't even go to the gym because of my anxiety. I however pay the same price for this app and I actually use it and am enjoying it so far, I can workout from the comfort of my own bedroom. Definitely worth it. Thinking about purchasing the additional accessories for this too. Only thing I think they could improve on is changing the music, throw some popular, fun songs in this, similar to Supernatural. Overall great experience so far."
1386,Avelina,"Aug 6, 2021 at 8:16 PM",4,A good work out.,"First I would like to state that they are not bribing me or giving me anything for my review. I have read a lot of the reviews on here and I understand the grievances. I honestly just started the journey with fitxr and I have started with the subscription model offered. I'm not here to judge mistakes made when it comes to payments or subscription, I'm here to talk about the dynamics of the app and the work outs. 

Today ,08/06/21, I did a 41 minute boxing session with a 9 minute dance. The boxing was out of this world. I have to work on timing so I don't loose my streaks, lol. My legs were really feeling the squats and side lunges, and my abs weren't far behind with all the uppercuts and hooks. I enjoyed the competition between the other fitxr members it kept me motivated. The only thing I have an issue with is that it is easy to press the trigger button and pause the game, making those buttons obsolete durring a work will help tremendously. I kept pausing the game until I adjusted my hands as far down as they could go on the handles, (only possible since I have  hand straps) but not comfortable by any means. The dance left a bit to be desired. Maybe something like just dance where you are shown the upcoming movement in a sequence as you go along. It's not easy to get a long streak because  you have to wait for the instructor to teach you the movement and as you try you loose your streak. I was able to get a streak of 77 but I think I am capable of more. Maybe with a few more classes I'll just know, :-). I will update on this as I try the other work outs offered and give my two cents to anyone that cares."
1387,robinez,"May 22, 2021 at 8:39 PM",1,unacceptable,"i was shocked to see my bought app changed in a subscription app. Absolutely unacceptable. They say you will have access to your old content. But the whole new layout if completely ranged to a subscription model and your original content can't be found, you see four tiles : Boxing, Dance, Fiit and Multiplayer.

Then on the boxing tile you see a series of 122 lessons. That's basically it, no clues about where your original content went. I started the app without knowing it would completely remove my content and progress and got confronted with this without any warning. 

- Where are my classes sorted on length? 
- where is my progress? 
- where can i find which classes of the 122 lessons were actually owned by me (don't get me even started that i have to click over 40 times to get to a class with a 10 minute workout)?
- why not create a tile with the lesson content for the users that bought this app before this subscription model
- i see that you are saying in replies that we will keep our content, but where can we find it, or are you saying that you send an update that also messes that up and that we have to manually contact you to get our paid content back, i can hardly believe that this is happening.

I do understand that people want to earn money, but why not create a new product called FitXR Online or just add a premium online tile in the app so that we have a choice? why annoy your customers that supported you during all these years? 

This whole subscription model is killing the whole VR gaming experience, now we reached a point that apps that you have bought can be changed without your approval and has less functionality then before (the class setup, the sorting system, the fact that your earpieces don't work anymore and that you have to use the build in speakers, the progress that is lossed which classes you had completed, and so on and on.)

I'm so disappointed."

The classes are so much fun and literally fly by. I would easily recommend this to anyone who enjoys a competitive group class setting in a traditional gym, which I do!!"
1391,DawnMonkey,"Jul 16, 2021 at 4:15 AM",2,Confusing after end of free trial,"***UPDATE 07/15/21 after end of free trial for previous owners dropped to 2 stars.

It's EXTREMELY CONFUSING and you CANNOT TELL if you've been automatically enrolled in monthly billing.

-There is no way to clearly opt out, only ""maybe later.""

-Under ""account"" it doesn't TELL YOU, in plain terms, if you are or are not enrolled.

-While there is a ""start 7 day free trial"" button, the description makes it sound like YOU ARE ALREADY ENROLLED in monthly billing. Fixing this language will improve users' reactions.

-The daily workout is available. If I click it, does it mean I've started the free trial?!

-I am unlikely to use content I ALREADY OWN bc I am concerned I'll find myself billed monthly.

This whole process has been handled horrendously. At the very least, enrollment or non-enrollment in monthly billing should be clear, not ambiguous.

I recommend checking the Oculus app under ""subscriptions"" to be certain you did not accidentally enroll. If you want a subscription fitness app, both Supernatural and Holofit are better, upfront about terms and have great customer service (I've contacted both).

***UPDATE 4/21/21 (After subscription update) EDITED after end of free trial.
While the subscription model changes improved many aspects of the game, I've gone back down to 2 stars re: above.

***PREVIOUS (edited re: accidental pauses and for 7/15 update for length):
Fit XR feels like an arcade game that gets you sweating. I would have given it four stars, but the accidental pauses on Quest 2 are maddening.

Having never had other environments, that doesn't bother me at all.  This is a fun game with decent fitness, and  I've had it for about a month, buying it after I was intrigued by the dance workouts. It turned out I didn't enjoy the ones I tried but the boxing is fantastic. I haven't done the group classes, but I imagine the competition aspect enhances the video game feel."
1392,Fonejackerjon,"Sep 10, 2021 at 12:44 AM",3,Not perfect but doesn't deserve the h8!,"Is it perfect? no, does it still have weird glitches and frame drops that happen  at the beginning of songs? Yes. Should this have been fixed by now? Yes......but....

There is no better game for fitness full stop. Beat saber, synth riders and others are great fun but this is a no nonsense boxercise game no stupid 360 modes, sabers, spins, skulls or whatever. No other fitness game allows you to just stand still and box facing forward, I hate games that make you spin or twist they are a pain in the a** This has no stupid gimmicks like that. No Xbooster isnt as good it's far too convoluted and inaccurate.

Now the sub part....ooooh this gets people back up doesnt it? So I'm a legacy player. Yes I have kept everything....did you hear that in the back row? You...get....to....keep....everything. Why are people still posting that they have lost their classes it makes no sense. All legacy and DLC still present and correct. Thank you

Not only that every legacy player has effectively been given a payout from fit xr of ¬£24 for free membership fees. Ie: three months free. Then at the end you get your old game back....simple. they didn't have to do that. As.....I'll say it again... Nothing has been taken away from you! 

No, I have not been paid by fit xr and no I am not a subscriber for the simple reason I only want to box, hate the dancing and not interested in HIIT. I just want to box..

So now a suggestion for the owners/devs of Fitxr, how about a 'box only' membership for say ¬£4 a month? All the boxing classes for that price. I'd sub tomorrow for that 100%  just not interested in the dance or HIIT so dont want to be paying for those classes. Its worth thinking about It would attract people that wouldn't ordinarily subscribe, so you are losing nothing and let's face it fit xr devs your not stupid you know at least 80% of users (probably more) only want to box. So some money is better than none at all isnt it?

Anyway review over. Still a daily player...tons of room for improvement but it has come along way."

It has helped me), I still love this game. I‚Äôm definitely with the monthly subscribers half of the crowd because I want higher quality (production-wise), more energetic and much more diverse music ala Beat saber, I want even more polished graphics ala Robo recall and I want even more interesting landscapes ala Supernatural. By supporting the developers with my monthly fee (which is really costing me only one silly Starbucks latte) I believe they will be able to keep pushing this awesome game forward. I‚Äôm not into FitXR‚Äôs dance or hit routines. I‚Äôve tried their hit classes a couple of times but still don‚Äôt get it. I only do boxing. My daily fitness routine consists of 10 min of Thrill of the fight, then 25 min of Supernatural and about 20 min of FitXR. I hope that with our help and monthly support FitXR will become even better. For those not willing to switch to a monthly fee, they say there is a way to keep all of your existing classes. Though I agree that their current class navigation system is almost useless. Let‚Äôs see where they go from here.

Update 21.07.21 For a couple of days I‚Äôve been trying HIIT. And I must say - kudos to the developers. It is an excellent way to finish my workout, the kind of interval? training I was looking for where very intensive 30 second workouts are spaced with 10 sec resting intervals all to the upbeat music. I didn‚Äôt understand HIIT but now I totally get it. One just needs to give it a bit more time to get used to. I have a smallish room to exercise in thus I‚Äôm extra careful not to hit anything. So far so good. If Supernatural is pure luxury then FitXR definitely feels premium now compared to other fitness products in VR. And with the updated playlists it is totally worth 9 bucks a month."
1404,Rick1993,"Jul 17, 2021 at 12:21 AM",5,Love this app!,"I don't understand a lot of the negativity regarding this app. It is absolutely my favourite fitness app out there. I personally primarily use it for the boxing sessions, which I think are really nice. You get to ""compete"" against different players directly and that really helps. I also enjoy the fact you can choose from different sceneries.

It also deserves mention that the support team is incredibly helpful and responds incredibly fast when I experienced a technical issue."
1405,Digital_Sculptress,"Jul 25, 2021 at 3:42 AM",5,MUCH GREATER WORKOUT THAN SUPERNATURAL!!,"I was debating between getting FitXR or Supernatural. After reading the negative reviews about FitXR and upset customers feeling betrayed, I decided to get Supernatural. I thought Supernatural was going to be great based on the reviews but boy was I wrong. Supernatural is NOT a workout unless probably if you are a beginner. Even in the highest difficulty, I could not break a sweat. And so I went back and pondered on getting FitXR again. I read the reviews again, put my emotions to the side, looks like the company of FitXR still let their previous customers have access to their old classes they signed up for before the subscription model. I mean I wouldn't really call that a scam. And so after thinking logically and after finding out how too easy Supernatural was, I decided to give FitXR a try. I did the 9 min intermediate workout and aww man, I truly felt the burn in just 9 min!!! I loved those flying UFO looking things coming at you that will get you squatting and also jumping to the side. I think it is the jumping side to side along with the variety of punches you can do that gives you the satisfying burn. I will definitely be keeping this membership. I can't wait to try the HIIT!!! I am so glad this exist."
1406,Dan,"Jul 29, 2021 at 12:26 AM",2,Almost there but disappointly janky,"This is almost there. Coming from playing Supernatural and a lot of Beat Saber for my vr fitness, I actually loved this because unlike those two the punching motion, dodging, and all the squatting feels way more intense than swinging your arms like a mad man. Plus it just feels like I'm taking a fun kickboxing class at my local gym, also it doesn't make you do some dumb 360 turns around your play space. Which is very much appreciated for someone like me that has a smallish play space and gets easily motion sick. The newly added hit mode is pretty cool when it works. For whatever reason the squat workout never actually registers my squats. Dance mode is very rough and needs to be completely reworked. The normal boxing class is the bread and butter and really my favorite pure vr fitness experience. Overall I really want to like this more than I actually do. The pause button being broken and impossible to resume workouts is extremely frustrating for someone like me trying to get a quick workout in during my lunch break. I'm always slipping my finger and pausing the game which was very annoying before but manageable. Now that pausing just breaks the game it's become truly unacceptable. The music selection is very blah. Supernatural has an amazing music line up the music tons of ska, punk, and classic rock that I can truly get down too. Here the music is fine to blah nothing amazing but it gets the job done. I'm able to accept that because if I were going to a local gym they'd more than likely just be playing some safe music so that no one complains so I'm okay with dealing with whatever music. Overall I really want to like this experience more than I actually do but you guys make it very hard to love with all the jankyness. I renewed my subscription because the steam version of beat saber had an update and broke all the mods. Had a good first day back, but second day I tried to get a work out in 3 times and it just kept breaking.

Let me remap the pause button or have it be a hold down for 5 secs, please fix the broken pause menu, hit is cool but squatting is broken (for me at least), music needs more niche cool stuff. I'd also just want some more features too like how Supernatural just connects to my apple watch and my other random chest heart rate monitor is actually kinda of amazing.

I really like this app more than I should but I'm just really frustrated with how janky it truly is. I cancelled my sub last time because of jankyness and was hoping it got better but sadly its more than less the same if not worse. I will more than likely not renew my sub at the end of the month"

1411,RecoilX,"Apr 16, 2021 at 10:37 PM",1,Don't support these guys - very scummy,"Bought this game at full price and was happy with it. But now just over a month later they switched to a subscription service. My original plan was to buy this game at $30, then buy DLC's after I get bored with the original game. Now they are forcing on a $10/month subscription service. Sure it has all the content, but if I wanted that I would of bought something else. So now instead of paying $30 + whatever DLCs I want of my choosing, it's $120 a year. 

UPDATE TO DEV RESPONSE
You‚Äôre changing a product (and over 200 - 1 star reviews show the blowback) that people didn't want. No matter what you write - history has proven that you haven't kept your word (such as with changes from BoxVR to FitXR, regardless of reasons why (technical or not)). 

You're going to support your subscribers, give updates, new content, updates, etc.. to them, and people like us who wanted a one time charge and to buy content as we want are going to be left in the dust. 

As for value - I don't want a reoccurring charge that's going to cost $120 dollars annually to have the best updates and content. I could literally buy the FitXR and all DLC for less that $100 - a *one time fee* forever.

And as for the word ‚Äúscummy‚Äù - you didn‚Äôt even notify people a month in advance‚Ä¶.you could of at least told the people that were about to buy FitXR what they were signing up for. 

Furthermore, the reason everyone is saying ""bait and switch"" is because what you're doing is literally the eCommerce sales tactic of taking one product, selling it a good value with lots of marketing, gaining *tons* of reviews, then using the same sales page, switching the product to another so people think that the reviews are still for that product ‚Äì but they aren‚Äôt. 

It doesn‚Äôt even matter what I think as a single customer of the change or how you justify it...look at all the negative reviews in the past day...."

It makes sense to me that they need a subscription model if they're going to make new content daily.

I've also tried supernatural, but I prefer fitXR, mostly because of the ""live"" leaderboard during the class. It sounds silly (even to me), but it really pushes me to work harder and keep my explosive streak going.

I find beatsaber fun, but it doesn't track power. I get a bit bored during supernatural. And thrill of the fight... well, I often finish feeling like I'm about to fall over and throw up üòÇ"

Yes, the music is different.  But I personally like it.  If I want to hear the Top 100-that‚Äôs what driving in my car is for!   I see it as a way of broadening my musical taste!  

As for the subscription. I got FitXR when it was ‚Äúfree‚Äù and you could buy DLC. Initially I was rowing the boat with everyone else and said ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be a subscriber when my trial period is over‚Äù. And guess what!  I‚Äôm a subscriber now!  The way I look at it.  If I do just one class a day (which I typically do more)-it‚Äôs only 33 cents for that one class!   Quite the deal!!

Frankly they are just mad because they bought an old app, and since its now a sub model they complain. The app does exactly what it says it does, there is lots of content. They allow family accounts under one sub.  Welcome to the age of subs. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, most MMO's, and other games. The subs allow the devs to keep putting up newer and better content. Frankly I think most of the complainers are misplaced and just want to complain since they have to spend more money. I have used his on my Quest, Quest 2, Rift, Rift S and Vive. There is NOTHING wrong with the game technically.

Quick crying and move on, or sub and enjoy the product.

When I first found the boxing portion of this app I was hooked and surprised myself at how much I looked forward to doing a round daily. Because it feels a lot like a game / game mechanics, it makes the time go by faster. When the HIIT exercises were released that's when I got hooked - the variety in each HIIT set makes the time fly by and the interactivity that the technology provides makes it feel like you're participating in the future of fitness."

Great that I can keep the old sessions but utter crap that nobody will be able to buy the product outright any more. And I used to be a real evangelist for FitXR. It had its quirks but it was offering something fun that worked at a fair price. There are way too many subscription models right now. I use this alongside AudioTrip Cardio, Oh Shape and my recently reopened gym. There's absolutely no way I can recommend FitXR to anybody that doesn't already have it now. I went in and downloaded the DLC packs I wanted that I was missing before I let the app update and I guess that's where the app will end for me.

I know this is probably how they have to do it to get regularly updated licensed music which everybody seemed to want but I really don't mind the music. Punching orbs in time is fun and a good workout. It gets a little repetitive given you can't see much about your stats/top scores, but I've started writing some of that stuff down. All I really wanted was some sort of percentage of explosive hits or number of hits missed to track my progress like every other VR rhythm game. Thought that was inevitable and surely so easy to implement. Instead the UI seems to have gone backwards. You have to scroll through endless pages to find a class and the writing is illegible. How they released it in this state is beyond me. Extremely disappointing.

I know they keep saying we can keep the content we bought, but I was urging so many friends and family members to consider the app. I was excited to be able to use the app with them in the future. Won't be doing that now."

Fitxr is cheaper and is a super complete workout. (Disclaimer: I only do boxing workouts). Even if they charge you guys 9.99$ (after a 3 months trial), they are still twice as cheap as their competitor. What do you expect... it takes money to make new content each weeks. The dev community listen actively to their users. Just join the community on facebook or submit feature requests. I can't disagree more with people giving 1 star to this game...

My arms are sore, and I work up a sweat doing them. I like the app, and I don‚Äôt see a problem with the $10 a month. My wife and I do StepBet, and we take the money out of the meager money we make over there.

1435,Sire Grogglz of Chathambergsville,"May 23, 2021 at 3:48 PM",1,Bait & switch; not worth a subscription,"One of the first apps (maybe the second after Beat Saber?) I bought when I got the Oculus; was really happy with the 25 or 30 dollar purchase.  There was a three or four star dance mode and a three or four star boxing mode, made me sweat more than the other rhythm games.  The boxing on this worked better and was less cheesy than others I‚Äôd seen, such as fitness boxing on Switch. The dancing seemed better than Dance Central and a nice change from Just Dance.  

Two days after I bought this, they started giving the app away for free and locking down content to subscription service, giving me huge buyers remorse and filling me with anxiety about how little content I‚Äôll have access to once my 90 day ‚Äúfree‚Äù membership trial (it‚Äôs not free, I paid that value, you thieves!) ends. They should have rolled out with a six month to one year ‚Äúfree‚Äù trial to show actual appreciation for their customers who funded them through this growing pain; they should have been crystal clear about exactly how much content owners of the paid app would retain and ensured that once the ‚Äúfree‚Äù membership trial was over, we‚Äôd still have an app that was worth 30 bucks. 

It doesn‚Äôt work for the devs to just say ‚Äúoh you get what you paid for‚Äù ‚Äî no we literally didn‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs beyond me why you think the subscription service is worth throwing out the fact that you had an app that was worth paying for.  They somehow skipped over the idea that you could have a paid app (with bread crumb updates and expansions) AND a premium service to rake in dollars from super fans, instead going all-or-nothing for the subscription service.

It is false advertising, poor customer service and terrible business sense rolled into one.

No one should subscribe to this because it‚Äôs simply not ten bucks per month worth of quality.  Get a Just Dance subscription; it‚Äôs far more enjoyable and the music is better.  Or purchase a couple of the rhythm games for oculus that have replay value. This game has two game modes that don‚Äôt have a lot of variety to engage you, you will login just to workout and switch away after a single ‚Äúclass‚Äù just because your headset is sweaty-wet and fogging up.  I‚Äôm optimistic that no matter how little content they leave me with after the subscription ends, it‚Äôll be plenty as I‚Äôll just need a warm up before switching to more enjoyable games. 

Anyone who thinks they want to spend ten bucks a month on this should take a personal finance class."
1436,Kingie,"Jul 16, 2021 at 12:40 AM",1,"Not a game, questionable DLC... Yet A+","Changed days‚Ä¶ 1 star

Edit-

Clearly this is not meant to be a 'game' in the sense of other rhythm based titles - But it is SO much better than these for what it is meant to achieve and that is getting a workout from your VR - more so in a way that encourages you to keep at it!  Sure other titles will get you sweaty at times but this one really gets you going!  Nor is it just some shadow boxing, try doing that by yourself and will stop in no time whilst this encourages you to push along in time with the beat, moving about and striving to work on your completely arbitrary score.  The real score is the calorie counter but hey, if it still keeps you in the zone the system works! :) 

Selecting session lengths that suite you and give back what you put in (i.e. don't gently brush the targets and wonder why your not sweating like some videos I have seen!) and you can use this title in a way that works for you.  I now use it every day especially with the current Covid19 restrictions and its having a marked improvement on my health in only a couple of weeks - its way more fun than going to the gym which I gave up on much quicker and isn't an option now anyway.

The only reason for not having 5 stars is the DLC  - its only 1 hour for 4 workouts - yet is 1/3 of the original price! :(  The game comes with 21hrs and I have no idea how many workouts!  Disappointing to say the least on that one and I wouldn't support this element.

Ps- Its not obvious but you can pause the game to have a drink, press the left controller button to ""continue"" rather than the onscreen options that only re-starts!  Also wireless headphones are pretty useless on the Quest and even more so on a game like this, so if your wondering why the sound doesn't match up...."

The audio issues are fixed so I‚Äôve been finally  BBC able to start using it. 
A few points:
-Boxing:
 >please remove the double punch, we‚Äôre not blocking. It‚Äôs pointless. 
>please remove the low punches. Another pointless move. 

-HIIT:
>the graphics need a lot of improvement. The coaches are not only distracting but not motivating. 
>feels more like a beta version of a new feature. 

-Dance:
>is so bad I have nothing to say. 

Overall:
I would give it 2 stars now. 
The boxing workouts are better with working audio. 
The app itself still needs a lot of work. 
The initial load takes too long and it looks like a game from the 90‚Äôs loading. 
Would I pay $10 a month after the trial period? No. 
I purchased the app so I‚Äôm hoping the content promised is still there and easy to find. 

Update 5/11/21:
Am I the only person that can‚Äôt adjust the volume? Every other app on my oculus quest has the capability to adjust the volume pressing the volume buttons. But this app I can‚Äôt. 
I reported this issue back in April 16th and other than a couple of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sorry‚Äù answers there‚Äôs is no resolution. I have been asking for an ETA and they just stopped responding. 
At this point the app is unusable. I have uninstalled it and installed it a few times. I‚Äôm running the latest oculus software update and still no resolution. 
Can I get a refund please?


Update 5/4/21:
Latest update sort of fixes the lack of filtering. By sort I mean is not intuitive at all. You need to click on search and then do a custom search. 
The volume issue is still not fixed. For me because of that makes the app unplayable. 
The app still feels like a beta release for devs or testers to play with. 


Update 4/28/21:
Even though I have updated my oculus quest 2 with the latest update (V28) the audio issue is still not solved. The app is unusable. 
I guess I will spend the entire trial period waiting for the issue to be solved.
Still no filter functionality. 
Still feels like a beta version. 

A week ago this was a 4 star app. Today is barely a 1 star app. 
Workouts were fun. 
After update nothing but glitches. 
Volume doesn‚Äôt work. Reported the issue and even though it is a rare but known issue it is blamed on the oculus. 
We‚Äôre being told the paid content we had will continue to be there after 90 days but nowhere I see the specifics of that. What will be the difference between the subscription and previously paid content. 
The UI not only is confusing, it is not welcoming. 
If you‚Äôre trying to compete with other subscription apps like supernatural you are light years behind. And for the $9 price, I rather buy the thrill of the fight and not be asked to pay anything extra. 
The trainees are not only not motivating, they are flat out annoying. Easily solved by lowering the volume that doesn‚Äôt work any more. 
The pause during gameplay doesn‚Äôt work. 

Bring back the old version.
Create a new one for the subscription. 

 Very disappointing. No real ownership of the issues, very little communication on the changes. 
An honest developer would have given a heads up of the change instead of shoving the changes down your throat."

Ever since that happened, headphones are entirely unusable as the sound will come out from the internal speakers instead with no way to change volume unless you do some quirky workaround. Because of my environnement, i cannot play this game without headphones and thus the game is unusable to me. Two of my friends who bought the game at the same time also experience this issue, so this is not a rare isolated thing.

I contacted customer service around 2-3 months ago about this matter and was told that they were aware of the issue and that it would be resolved shortly. That was back in winter.... summer‚Äôs comming up and still not resolved or any idea when it will be. 

That‚Äôs not counting the move to sub which I find iffy at best, but I won‚Äôt get into that as everybody else did already.

There were 3 walls,  one with all available workouts that could be easily filter,  there was a wall with the workout of the day,  and there was a wall with your favorite workouts and settings. It was clean,  organized,  pretty,  and made sense.     Now the view is giant photos of the instructors with the name of the workout near the bottom of the photo.  The filter option was recently re-added to the game, which is good, but it wasn't intuitive and lots of people on Facebook had to ask where it was.   Overall,  it takes longer to choose a workout and when you have limited time to workout,  the interface is motivation killer.   They also recently added the HIIT studio.   I was hoping for something great but it's confusing and it's too focused on points instead of fun and fitness.   You actually lose points if you do it wrong.   I used to love boxing in FitXR and was boxing 5 days a week for at least an hour each time.   I understand they needed to convert to a subscription model for business reasons.  I'm okay with that.   I just wished they didn't make the user interface so frustrating, demotivating, and ugly."

1446,Ziegenhirt,"Jul 28, 2021 at 10:41 AM",3,Very disappointing April 2021 update,"1.The new UI is a big back step in terms of user experience.

2.Switching to monthly paid membership is a NO GO. I know, for existing users it‚Äôs optional. Whatsoever.

3.Provide a link or an in game possibility to IMMEDIATELY switch back to the ‚Äúolder but very good‚Äù version. I really don‚Äôt want to wait 90 days.


Update 15.07.2021

Till 14. April 2021 this fitness app was really, really, really great.

The 15. April 2021 the app indicated an available update. I installed it -> BIG mistake.

The initially great UI was replaced by a far less usable one. You need several clicks more to get the same work done.

Worse. They switched from one time payment to monthly subscription based payment. They gave a 90 day free trial period to existing customers, promising you will not loose your already paid content. 

Today, 15. July 2021, exactly 3 month / 90 days later, there is a new update available. I installed it -> This was an even BIGGER mistake. I never switched to the monthly charged subscription and I never will. My expectations were fulfilled.

When you start the app the only thing you see now is a gray/black universe. You can look 360¬∞ around you. There is no longer a menu available. You have no longer access to the game. I removed the app and reinstalled it. The result is the same.

That‚Äôs the proof they lied to us the last 90 days. Without subscription you will loose every content you bought from them.

Long story short:

If you are a potential new customer and are reading this update, run, run as fast as you can to other fitness products.

If you are an existing customer. God bless you. Perhaps we can start a law suite if we get enough people together. 

Except the possible law suit I‚Äôm done with this company.


Update 28.07.2021

Between 22.07.2021 and 26.07.2021 they published an update which fixes the missing menu in the universe. The app is now again playable. I play the app without subscription.

Through the ‚ÄúMyClass‚Äù menu you get access to your bought content. That is the base game workouts (I use only the box workouts). The DLCs content should also be there. I can‚Äôt test this because the app switched to monthly subscription before I was able to buy DLCs.

Suggestions for the developer:

- For the player important workouts can be stored in the favorites menu. So please don‚Äôt hide the favorites menu in the settings menu. Put the favorites menu at the top level so it is accessible as fast as possible.

- Horizontal scrolling to the workouts is tedious, because you see five workouts at the time, but you can only scroll by one workout instead of the horizontal page (five workouts wise).

- The monthly subscription service is not the same as the one with the DLCs. So the one product is not a concurrency for the other one. It would be nice if you could also provide the DLCs. This way you could also avoid angry customers who feel ‚Äúto be forced‚Äù to  switch to the monthly subscription.

- I really miss the UI which was available til 14. April 2021. Less steps were necessary to get the same work done. Perhaps you could provide the former UI as a setting to choose."

1451,Simon,"Jun 30, 2021 at 2:41 AM",5,Excellent fitness game,"You're probably going to see a lot of 1 star reviews from folk that got into this before the subscription came in. They have their valid criticism of the game but this is for those of you that are trying this out after the fact.

I'm really impressed with what's on offer here. The subscription price is fair in my opinion as you're given a lot for it. Tonnes of genuinely great workouts with so much variety with updates that you're going to be able to try new things out all the time

Its an excellent way to exercise in the vr and time flies when you use this. It's been getting me moving and helping me to lose weight steadily and in a fun way. Couldn't be happier with the service. I really recommend taking a look as you get a free trial anyway so nothing to lose."
1452,Ati,"May 21, 2021 at 9:15 AM",1,It was a good game.,"I've bought this game, i paid a one-off price. I loved it from the first minute, brilliant home workout and beautiful graphics. I kept telling to my friends how good it was and how useful. Every respect for that. 

But now it became a subscription model. I read the developer's answers saying that i can keep the original content and i'd get updates too, but honestly, it's hard to believe that the ""non-profit"" version (used by only a handful of people who haven't requested a refund or haven't subscribed to the new model) would get the same updates as it would get if it was ""profit"". We'll see, if it does i'll update my rating.

Other than this, i feel that while the increased number of classes might be a good selling point, they're actually a drawback for me. 

1. There are no filters anymore. I'd like to sort by difficulty and i'd like to sort by length. It worked fine in the previous version, why did you remove it? Is there anybody who likes to scroll through 60+ classes one-by-one?

2. It'd be vital to give a demo of the songs, just like AudioTrip does. Obviously we're different and we like different music. Some of the tracks simply make my cry, but once i started the workout and i'm on fire i don't want to quit the workout, scroll through the classes again and try again, so i keep going, but it's something that greatly spoils the fun. To cut it simple, if you increase the number of choices you don't remove the filters, but add more, that should be obvious.

3. It might be just me, but i'm middle-aged & heavy. I usually use 10 min or shorter workouts. Adding lots of 20 - 30 min workouts means nothing to me, i can choose from 5-10 workouts only. Also, when i didn't have time i picked a 3 min workout and i did that quickly. It took no time but still i was able to do some exercise. I'd be happy to see more short workouts.

4. Not a big deal, but would it be difficult to add a ""Quit"" button to the control panel? I'm sure many of us would like that."

Yes, I know, it is not exactly that, but for a person with an average to good fitness level, I would say it is totally worth it.
There is VR boxing and dancing, which both are great and there are many workouts to choose from.
The motion tracking in the best I've seen in VR games, I've never had a missed punch because of sensor issues.
There are features coming, for instance HIIT training, so for you money, you can see the team is actually working.
The graphics are neat and do the job, the music is great and always uplifting.

In overall, I am looking forward to the future of this app.
And no, it is not a paid review :D, I am on my 7 day trial, but will continue as a paying member, I think the team deserves our money.

Also they've come a long way and had to make changes, but that just proves they are trying to make it better and better."
1457,CoolNinja,"May 21, 2021 at 12:59 AM",1,What the???,"First time I have ever gone from 5 star down to 1. What happened to the game I adored? I tried the game after the update first changed it all and wow , are you serious. Let‚Äôs look at before the update. I entered a brightly lit area. The UI very well done. Latest workout on my left at an angle. Song selection in front of me. Then a far better search function to my right at angle. These screens wrapped around me. Was great.

Now this. Dark bleak location. What do you think of when you think workout? Dark bleak area or brightly lit building? In this new set up every screen(new workout,song selection,and search all in a very boring flat layout. Where is the great search function that was before update? And when I scrolled through the workouts it went literally 1 at a time. ???? 
Subscription model? Seriously? So does that mean if I do not subscribe I will never get any new workouts? I do not ever subscribe to any game. Never will. If I did I would at least need to be able to keep the songs that where added if I paid for a month. Not lose access to them if I cancelled subscription. Another thing that would have to be changed. Would need to get rid of the use of an avatar for multiplayer workout. You know, the one with no moving mouth. That all takes away from the feeling like you are in a class. Check out the game supernatural for how that part should be done. (Just an example as I will not pay to play that either) No live multiplayer?

Just wow . No thank you"

Do you guys not realize that they already paid for this game? What did they pay for? Why are they not already members? Do you really believe 3-minute demos are worth $30? This company is a real troll; your responses are as fake as your multiplayer. I heard that they did other scummy things with their old boxVR game and then completely abandoning it. You guys are really trying to bent over your old customer and milk more money out of them; I guess you weren't getting much money from them packs; I have no idea how this is legal. You somehow phuck yourself down to 3.5 Stars for $10 a month, while Supernatural is in the corner drinking their moonshine and charging their customers $20 a month for a retard cousin version of beat-saber.

They fell into a burning ring of fire
They went down, down, down

When hearts like ours meet
You fell, like a child

1464,jojo,"Jun 26, 2021 at 11:17 PM",2,Needs custom song support/better music,"Update: I got an annual membership to supernatural, and never use this app at all anymore. 

Update: it‚Äôs nice that the devs eventually offered to restore box vr after the forced update, but I‚Äôve moved on to supernatural. It‚Äôs *much* more expensive, but I just enjoy it so much more‚Äîit might be my favorite quest activity, and is certainly my most used. I‚Äôll check in on fit Xr if it posts intriguing updates in the future.

Edit: seems the new version was pushed onto my quest without my consent. Not thrilled with that, especially since I lost my playlists and the daytime environment, which I much prefer. So docking a star from my original review.  A lot of changes, but the music remains stale and limited. If I want an intense workout with electronic music (which has, for me, the least objectionable songs), I have three options‚Äîa 3-minute workout that is actually hip hop and two 60-minute workouts. I can‚Äôt skip songs I don‚Äôt like, or create a playlist anymore, so my original problems with the music in this app are exacerbated.

The update did bring some improvements-workouts are now rated by intensity and punch speed is now tracked.  I still like the mechanics (though the maps aren‚Äôt perfect).

But once the weather gets colder and I‚Äôm workinI‚Äôll be giving Supernatural a try‚Äîmusic options I like in bright environments with new workouts (and music) daily sounds like it‚Äôll be worth $20/month to me. fitvr doesn‚Äôt offer any of that.



Original review: I like the core mechanics and the graphics of this app a lot‚Äîit‚Äôs a decent little bit of cardio. But I really don‚Äôt like the music‚Äîso much so that I play it without any sound,and listen to my own music over the stereo. That takes a lot of the fun out of the workout, since there‚Äôs no satisfaction from hitting targets in time to the rhythm of the music I‚Äôm listening to. To be fair, this is an issue for any rhythm game for me‚Äîcustom songs *have* to be an option. Please, devs, bring that option to the quest. 

As others have noted, not having workouts categorized by difficulty is unfortunate.  And the workouts included with the base app need some tougher options‚ÄîI have to add a lot of extra movement to get the level of workout I‚Äôm looking for, even with wrist weights, and I don‚Äôt love that I‚Äôd need to buy an add on (of songs I know I won‚Äôt like) to get a tough, well-choreographed workout.  My heart rate gets going more on thrill of the fight, but I like the mechanics of boxvr better for an aerobic workout. 

Incidentally, the music is competent, but is basically like the music that is composed for tv ads (hence, presumably, no need for the devs to pay hefty royalty payments)."
1465,Xpertic,"Jun 26, 2021 at 1:05 PM",2,Mixed Feelings,"Although this game is a fun work-out game, it seems to have a lot of issues. Unfortunately there is no alternative.

The good:
This game has a lot of work-outs and these get updates regularly. Personally I am a fan of the boxing work-outs and enjoy playing them with some minor frustrations regarding some unregistered hits or framedrops. I also like some of the electronic soundtracks and they do fit perfectly.

The bad:
One of the frustrating things is the subscription. Multiple times at the end of the subscription period it seems to take a while for the automatic renewal to take effect. This means I cannot play fitxr payed work-outs, only free to play. An easy fix in my opinion would be a grace period for subscribers.

The hit box issue is well know in the fitxr community.
Although the company claims it to be faulty technique. I‚Äôve tried numerous and watched multiple videos to see if I can improve. In my opinion is happens often when I notice a framerate drop, level change or when some combination is required. 
Even multiple times with same technique and speed it registers and sometimes it does not. I‚Äôve ruled out the obvious things like batteries in controllers. These are not causing issues even at full speed hits.
It is also very strange that the newest work-outs have these issues the most. 

To summarize, this game and it‚Äôs work-outs are a lot fun in potential. But some of the issues are really frustrating and sometimes even kills your motivation to play. Personally I get the feeling this is partially due to graphics, framerate and controller calibration. Maybe an option would be to give users control over these settings and for example let them set it to lower and see if this solves some of the issues and responsiveness. I think many user would sacrifice some downscaling to more workout fun.

Like I said, there is no alternative. But if these issues continue and there eventually will be a competitor, I would certainly consider moving to another subscription based workout game and I think many users might agree."

However, I hope they continue to work on their environments.  It'll be great to earn tokens that will open up more environments. Also, the little things need improvement, like seeing the entire playlist AFTER the workout. A lot of the music is really good. I've been doing this for months and I still don't know the titles of my favorite songs. I was able to buy Passion by Xan Young after searching intensely for the artist. It always baffles me when people feel they are entitled to receive stuff for free. Human beings are WORKING  to put this app together. None of them want to do their job for free. So you got in during the free-phase. Be happy about that. The free phase is for trial and error. It helps developers perfect their product. I thought apps have been around long enough for people to get that. All the crying  about $10 a month??? Sigh... Anyway, good job developers. Keep it.

Audio isn‚Äôt working at all for me - no sound despite volume set to high on oculus. Also some of the ‚Äòchoreography‚Äô on the Feel About It workout is buggy - there are a bunch of punches in the middle that don‚Äôt flow together - feels a bit rushed, maybe it wasn‚Äôt tested.


Previous review
Ignore the 5 star reviewers suggesting people are just ‚Äúbutthurt because they don‚Äôt understand‚Äù - they‚Äôre the ones not getting it - anyone not subscribing has lost the option to buy new content, it‚Äôs as simple as that. I‚Äôm kicking myself - if only I‚Äôd known the devs were going to put new content behind a monthly paywall. If I could afford the a monthly sub I would invest it in a non VR fitness app, for a broader range of workouts. 
The rest of the update is also disappointing, the new UI is less intuitive and a clunkier experience - you‚Äôll be scrolling through pages of locked classes after the 90 day trial ends,  and whilst the free trial may placate some existing owners, I‚Äôm not ready for the majority of the unlocked content so it‚Äôs no compensation. If nothing else, please restore the original filters to reduce the click click click clicking.

Re your response, sorry, that‚Äôs not a acceptable answer - I bought the game on the basis of being able to buy DLC‚Äôs as and when I can afford them.

1472,Kuro,"May 6, 2021 at 12:09 AM",1,Scam: bait and switch,"You cannot trust this company. If you buy a product from them, they will not hesitate to delete it, leaving you high and dry, with no access to the thing you purchased. They will raze it & replace it with a new one with less functionality. They should be releasing separate products that stand on their own merits, but instead will take whatever product you bought & burn it to the ground. They did it with their previous game boxVR, which they deleted leaving customers without access to the things they loved, & now they have done it again with fitXR. Customers who purchased the game no longer have access to the thing they purchased (at a premium), since that game is now gone forever. In its place is a free to play subscription service. This is the most anti-consumer move a company can do. The company responded to my previous review, but the response is copy and paste, and it does not address the main concern that you cannot trust a company that keeps continually deleting ( and thus removing your access to) the thing you bought. Under UK law, when a customer purchases something it has to be ""fit for purpose"", and ""as described by the seller"". Continually deleting what you sell someone & replacing it with something else is at the very least anti-consumer, if not downright illegal. In the move to subscription, I can guarentee this behaviour by the company can only get worse. What motivation do we, as customers, have to invest in an ecosystem that will sooner or later be burned to the ground once the dev decides to move onto the next fad? Regarding the quality of the update: it is in an alpha state and not fit for end users with most features not implemented yet. None of the content is worth a recurring payment. The subscription offers worse value than the previous fee to pay with DLC model. I will be sure to avoid this company moving forward for reasons of a lack of trust."

Some classes are fun and it looks like training but no challenge. I was excited for Hiit Studio but it's absolutely boring. Really bad think is that, it is online game!!! I was totally frustrated when class crashed because my internet crashed. I am happy that i bought some classes as DLC before they started subscription model and i am able to play some normal classes without subscription.

So overall 50% for this game it's fun and smt like training during long winter nights. I will not stop to play it but i think that i will never pay for subcrtiption that much sad. Try to add some DLC or make subscription cheaper. Apple music familly costs 9$ and this is music for 6 people not game with some classes for single account without offline play."

I'd just recommend getting a second silicone cover for your face. You will get sweaty if your doing the 20 min+ workouts and its easier to clean off the silicone than it is to get the regular foam insert all sweaty and have to deal with that.

Part of the new update is supposed to be the new Hit mode. Why is this feature not available during our trial period? You‚Äôre majorly changing the game and putting out a half finished product. 

Update is also missing features and has many bugs. You can‚Äôt change the volume in the game via the headset volume button. Sometimes the headphones are plugged in but sound comes from the speakers. 

Adding new features takes time and the devs deserve to be compensated, which I was happy to do by buying DLC. The fact they‚Äôve changed the game twice now shows they don‚Äôt have confidence in their product and neither should you. 

Add a method to expand the game without the subscription and I will change my score. As it stands now the game‚Äôs not worth it if you are s new user."

I‚Äôm not sure I understand all the hate about the subscription. You don‚Äôt lose what you already paid for. I don‚Äôt mind paying each month if it helps pay for new content. But if the content is not good I certainly won‚Äôt be paying. 

Anyway, keep up the good work."
1479,Roxy,"Jun 8, 2021 at 9:15 PM",5,Pretty freaking good,"Update: After FitXR responded, I found the filter and it's super easy to use. That was my main hang up with the game so I'm changing from 4 stars to 5. I have been using Supernatural since April and I have to say, even though I love that app and the trainers, FitXR is freaking next level. Better overall workout, and several workout modes. I finally tried the dance mode today, it's freaking intense even at the beginner level. lol I'm not very coordinated but that didn't seem to be an issue. Between the boxing and the dance workouts, I actually really like this app and I'm going to go ahead and fully subscribe after my free trial ends.

I'm on the free 7 day trial and so far it's pretty good, and I'm only doing solo workouts so far. I'm not sure I really like the music yet, seems to be heavy on generic pop, hip hop, and some pop sounding electronic music. I did find a couple of rock songs but they were more advanced than I can do right now. Would have liked to see maybe a little more rock at the beginner level, as well as dubstep or something less poppy. The UI is easy to use, but really it's *too* easy. There's no sort or filter feature so you just have to scroll through every workout. Even without better music I'd probably give the app 5 stars if they added filters. 

I must say I almost didn't even give this app a chance because of all the negative reviews in recent months. After actually reading the reviews, it seems most of them were existing customers who were just unwilling or didn't know to contact customer support to resolve problems from switching to a subscription app. I use Beat Saber, and if they ever switched to a subscription model and I couldn't figure out how to use the new interface to find my purchased content, I'd contact customer support before I jumped on the band wagon to try and tank their app rating."

1481,Sam,"Jun 14, 2021 at 8:29 PM",5,Game changer,"So I am going to start with the thing that seems to be the issue with most negative reviews here. The subscription can be annoying but if you use it regularly it is 100% worth getting. You get lots of extra classes and access to HIIT workouts too and if it isn't for you then you still have the base game workouts you can come back to anytime. I am someone who struggles with my weight and not exercising properly so for me this game is brilliant. I mainly focus on the boxing but the HIIT workouts I have done are fantastic too, I always end my session sweating and feeling like I have worked very hard. If you are looking for a fun, intense, easy to use workout game for your Oculus device then I would 100% recommend getting this game."
1482,Ez Dub Hehe,"Apr 15, 2021 at 9:44 PM",1,Paid App Is Now Just a Demo,"The new update has ruined this app. I PAID for the app before the update, but did not purchase additional content over the base workouts that were included. I initially switched to this app because I found the subscription model of the other, better, workout app to be off-putting. I was happy to use the included workouts for the one-time price. 

Now after the most recent update, the app I PAID for has removed all the included workouts and is only able to do workouts that are three minutes or less. So the app I PAID for is now essentially no better than a demo and the only way to do longer workouts is to pay for a monthly subscription.

I also saw an article mentioning a free 90-day trial for previous purchasers. While I didn't see this offer in the updated app anywhere, it's a poor approach. You have removed the base features of the app I PAID for. Offering to give me back something I've already PAID you for for 3 months for free is ridiculous. 

The app I purchased is no longer functional in the way it was originally. I'd prefer a full refund instead of an up-sell.

What a ripoff."
1483,Punku,"Jul 15, 2021 at 11:30 AM",3,not worth a subscription,"I tried this app for around three weeks, and I am kind of disappointed.

1486,Elaine,"May 10, 2021 at 6:17 PM",1,Give us back BoxVR,"I have BoxVR on PSVR and I used it almost every day. Then they became FitXR and did a complete overhaul for Quest. PSVR users are still waiting for the change. I got tired of waiting and got it on Quest, but I'm disabling my internet on my PS4 in hopes of keeping Box.

Fit looks very pretty and at first I was excited about the changes. But then you start playing and you realize the only way to maintain streaks is to punch as hard as you can every single time. This seems like a great way to get hurt and is actually very demotivating. There's a ""training"" mode that makes every hit count, but it punishes you by removing point multipliers. Who the heck was the brilliant mind behind this? Isn't this supposed to make exercise fun?

Then recently they did the ultimate bait and switch and changed to a subscription model, something that turns a lot of people off, but hey, they already got our money so joke is on us. I don't understand how this is even legal, sell one product and then change to a completely different one after it's bought. This has left a very sour taste in a lot of people's mouths.

(I expect one of their copy and pasted responses assuring me my complaints aren't valid. Even if we can keep the base game, they removed the DLC add-ons. So only way to get new content is to subscribe. See another reviewers valid complaint that subscribing isn't ""optional"" if you remove all other options this way.)
I won't be subscribing, and in fact I'm uninstalling Fit from my Quest because I never use it anymore. And I certainly won't buy another product from this company as long as they think this is an acceptable business model. Bring back BoxVR and then leave it alone!"
1487,rjaxon7525,"Jul 1, 2021 at 12:35 AM",4,It Keeps Getting Better!,"UPDATED Review: Still an amazing product. Recent updates added 2 new Game Modes (Multiplayer & HIIT) and it includes a ton of new content and a dramatic UI/UX change. 

PROS: There are now 4 key Game Modes: Boxing, Dance, HIIT & Multiplayer. There is also a ton of New Levels & Music with new content every day! Adding the ""Challenge of the Day"" and daily curated content is a key driver for keeping the app fresh. The newly updated UI/UX does a good job of highlighting the Game Modes while spotlighting 5 curated levels. Additionally, a Favorites Icon & a Score Meter have both been added to individual level icons (one of my previous requests). Overall, this update was a wonderful upgrade for the customer. 

CONS: The UI Update added a Favorites Icon to the Level Image but the highlight color is white and not visible on the light gray backgrounds (so it's fairly useless). The updated UX Design buried almost all of the levels so only 5 levels show at any time. That means the endless scrolling to find levels in the previous design is even worse in the update.  SORTING has lost the ability to filter by LEVEL, DURATION or MUSIC. FAVORITES has been buried in SETTINGS. Daily Workout Results are now buried in STATS. These are all relatively minor issues (and easily fixed) but they are worth noting. 

My biggest source of frustration with the recent update...is the dramatic increase in ""below the belt"" punches in Boxing Mode. The  kneecap punches & cross-thigh ""slaps"" are frustrating and immediately take you out of the boxing theme and it almost always kills any streak I have. It would be good to have the option to ""dislike"" a level (maybe even hide it) so I can avoid these in the future. 

Overall, this is still a PHENOMENAL product and well worth the purchase price! I use this product daily and it has become a staple in my workouts in the last year. MAJOR KUDOS to everyone that continues to improve this product! Keep up the good work!"

1489,Chaly Flavour,"May 4, 2021 at 7:12 PM",1,FitXR subscription scam,"FitXR once was a five star game and I'd never write a review refering to old versions. I make an expection for FitXR to let new customers now what you can expect for your money from Sam Cole/ FitXR.

The game once was 30 bucks, every addtional DLC package was 10USD, one-time buy. You had a virtual gym building and a menu including various filters e.g. dance/boxing, music type, course duration, difficulty and trainers.

Today you get a black entrance room, a fullscreen menu. Available filters are dance/boxing, trainer, that's it. 

About the recent multiplayer
You once were able to do a solo or multiplayer training. I doubt, the multiplayer sessions weren't live but recorded, but you'd never know, because there was no interaction possible at all. TL;DR: nice but useless.

About the new multiplayer
Today, you get a room code that you can share with a friend. From here on you want to find another review telling you more about the experience, because I do my trainings on my own.

Subscription
While I'm writing this, you get a 7 day trial when purchasing the game. According to fitxr.com you get a new course every day. The subscription costs you 10USD a month. Fitxr.com/membership lists these features without telling you what is already working:
- New workout released daily (working)
- Huge on-demand class library (never found it)
- Box and Dance studios. (not released) HIIT studio out in May (not released)
- Music from major and indie record labels (music is fair but unknown/indie)
- New captivating environments, plus more soon (not released)
- Multiplayer with voice chat (never tested)
- Regular feature releases (well.. for subscribers only?)

One-Time purchase features
While fitxr.com tells us, what they will include in their subscription (most of those features are still ""comming soon"") they don't tell us, what you'll get for your 30USD one-time-purchase.

HIIT training
This is comming soon and not released yet.

Don't waste your money."
1490,Aquarian 1,"Jun 21, 2021 at 8:54 PM",5,Worth 4 times the price easily,"If you actually want to get fit, buy this app.  It is not mandatory to pay a montly fee.  I think some young users are mad because they cant walk around looking at their phone while working out.  Seriously.  This app with ALL of the UPDATES is AWESOME.   Beware of people hating on this app that don't know how to use it.  I know four of  my friends have purchased it and have thanked me 10 times.  Sorry but it seems like someone is campaigning to hate on this app.   I am an actual user.  Paid to give high reviews?   Girl, you trippin!!!!!!!  This app changed my life and contiinues to improve my health.    I am praying to the Occulus Gods that you don't change this app, at least that you leave the latest changes in place.  I bought the first version when it was just boxing. Then the updates started coming in and now it is worth easily four times what I paid for it.   Now there are personal trainers and so many different types of workouts, even dancing, with currrent music tracks listed as you play.  The trainers talk to you and know how you are doing.  I have lost 22 lbs in the last 4 months and still heading lower.  Both of my personal trainer friends are jealous of my results.  The workouts they have added are crazy effective and fun.   What I am frustrated about is people leaving reviews that try to make it look like you have to pay monthly for it.  that is an add on app!!!! That is an  option but not a requirement.  Haters leave reviews that seem shallow like they didnt explore the app well.  This should be at the top of the fitness apps to purchase when you go to that category of the website.  I will be furious if this app loses support!  Please Please Please.  This app should be heavily promoted for fitness and just plain mood enhancement from the endorphins and the awesome music tracks.  You can play with friends you can save your favorite workouts.  If this app loses support I will crush my occulus quest in the street."

So many bugs in the new version. This should really go back to Beta status.  E.g. I don't understand how UAT missed the fact they took away the search function. This means you waste a load of time trying to find a decent routine for what you want.

I think the devs must have been forced into releasing against an unrealistic deadline, Cyberpunk 2077 style, before making sure it was fit for use. 

Bring back FitXR where you can buy the add ons, and by all means create a FitXR+ where people can subscribe monthly."
1493,Genki,"Apr 21, 2021 at 5:34 AM",1,"Nope, don‚Äôt start this subscription üí©","I have been trying to get my 100+ coworkers and all my friends/family to join the VR bandwagon since I bought mine Dec 2019. When the Quest 2 came out at a lower price point, I FINALLY made some headway in getting people to try it. Before that, I literally had TWO oculus Friends. üòÇ I have also enjoyed seeing new members join the Oculus Quest Ladies FB group on a daily basis, many of them new to not only VR, but gaming in general. Everyone is SO excited by what they‚Äôre discovering and now many of them are starting to regret their purchase, as FitXR is one of the most popular games the newcomers have been buying...

... There is no way VR is going to survive (or thrive, at least) if the most popular apps start doing a subscription model. To expect already hesitant people to not only spend $300+ on a headset, but to also expect to pay ~$10/month per game to access worthwhile content and features? Don‚Äôt be greedy. Make most of the content available to purchase without a subscription, but also offer a membership with full access and a couple cute special features that just add to the non membership experience, don‚Äôt take anything away from non-members. FitXR + ... isn‚Äôt that what most brands are doing these days anyhoo? The subscription should be an extra irresistible treat, not the main dish. People will pay, your game is that good, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs THIS good. 

Also, $9.99 is too much. Most people are already paying for several subscriptions these days. It‚Äôs getting insane. People are trying to find some fun and joy during such a hard economic time and NOW is when you want them to basically start spending $120/yr to play your game? *sigh*  Do you realize how much your users have already invested to play your game and now you want them to give you waaaay more, for the same and indefinitely? At least price it like iCloud with a more nominal fee of $2.99/month... something more people are willing to set and forget. $10 though? Nope. 

Last, I‚Äôm not seeing anything in these copy/paste responses about what families do. Do they have to buy multiple subscriptions for each family member if they want to do multiplayer? üò≥

You‚Äôre going about this all wrong and are going to start an awful trend... please fix this, otherwise you‚Äôre going to keep seeing the single star reviews pile up and people stop playing. We‚Äôve had enough of these shenanigans, let us enjoy and support your hard work, but this is just plain bs."

Not everybody wants a new program every day. I understand the subscription based thing. But not everybody wants that. This used to be part of my overall workout routine. I would select different levels and different programs based on what I was doing that day. Now I need to scroll through 45+ programs? I can only filter by instructor, then have to scroll through 45 programs? 

The update made it unusable for me.

Still 5 Stars

I'm 280 lbs and looking for an exercise routine that motivates me, and I must say this has been great. I love that it forces you to squat but like any game you get out of it what you put it.

I've been using it everyday for around a month now and I've lost well over a stone , my clothes fit better, im physically fitter and best of all, I feel more confident

The latest update is absolutely amazing, the HIIT workouts really get your heart rate going. Honestly if your someone like me who unfortunately put on the extra lockdown weight and felt self conscious about how you looked I highly HIGHLY recommend this game . 
The music is surprisingly good aswell, when i heard it wasn't ""licenced songs that I'd know"" I felt a bit meh but actually the songs are so good I've found myself trying to find them on Spotify for car trips.

This game or ‚Äúexperience‚Äù is not worth any kind of monthly expense. At its core, it‚Äôs a mediocre punching game with bad music. Get a real gym membership if you‚Äôre that committed to getting in shape.

1510,Bootaro,"May 3, 2021 at 6:40 AM",1,Why remove features?,"I bought this game a week and a half before the big update. And I did enjoy it. I also bought a pack before the update. I didn't look too deep into the community to see if this was coming but... Hindsight being what it is I wish I did.

The subscription seems steep. I think a workout a day is cool on paper. But most people including myself would prefer quality over quantity. If this sub money went to a workout a week with licensed songs that were awesome and bombastic, I think more people would be behind that then what's currently on offer. Which is more of the same stuff that's slowly being buried by daily releases, that don't explain what the work out is, which goes into.....

No info given on what a workout is. Is it lower body focused? speed focused? No clue on what anything actually is. Removing of information is my biggest problem with the game part of this update

Removing the filter menu is something I don't even have an idea as to why it seemed like an idea. Oh but you can filter based on instructor??? Which, no shade on the instructors personally, but it's the most useless filter ever. Why can't I sort by difficulty, length, genre, basic stuff that was in the game before.

And it's also painfully obvious they are gonna tease us with the HIIT mode, which I would want to do personally. But we all know it's gonna be at the end of the 90 days or just before to give us a taste. They are putting out a workout a day, do they really think we're that stupid to think a high intensity mode is super hard to make?

Look at how successful games make money. Look at warframe. They offer a fun game first, and have enough faith in their product that people will spend money. And it built a strong community. Games that fail treat their customer like fast food. Milk you for all you have and kick you out. It's not sustainable. You have time to fix this.

Edit. My comment on the HIIT mode, removal of filters and general workout info may have a legit reason behind it's absence or delay. But the devs are not communicating it well enough. I also understand their angle is ""$10 for a song everyday is better value."" But I don't personally want 5 million different workouts that feel the same. Especially without a filter of any kind. I want better songs. Even if that effects the amount we get a month. A eurobeat workout would be awesome. Not the same generic techno workout again."

1514,br0ck7,"Apr 28, 2021 at 4:34 AM",1,120$ a year?!! Your high,"All i can say is im glad i waited a few weeks and didnt buy this game last month  downloaded thinking it was a demo version only to find out it was the full game and had been converted to subscriptions.    What money hungry crap.   Let me guess  you subscribe and get a new workout every day as the devs have been saying but then you cancel the sub and dont get to keep a thing but the base free game version.  120$ a year is absurd especially seen as you really dont own anything for it it all hinges on the fact that you keep paying monthly

 And to think its actually a fun workout.   I dont have 120 a year to spend on A(singular) game. I dont feel like any game is worth 120 let alone yearly
 Definitely deserves the negative reviews it getting.. i feel bad for those who have already purchased.

There are very few games of any type that I play regularly, but I have enjoyed FitXR....that is until this forced update. I struggled through updating my Quest just to accept the app update because it was apparently incompatible with the previous version. The game crashed several times and I needed more than one update for it to finally start, which took more time than I allot for my morning workout. When I circled back around to get the app set up again so that it just starts up in the morning, I was met with the 72-page agreement to accept and an inferior application that I am welcome to experience for *free* for the next 90 days. I updated my headset software just so that you can offer me a subscription? Not because you worked on hand tracking features or anything useful like that...Why don't you reward those of us who have supported this app for years by letting us ""downgrade"" to the original app the way that it was and let the new people have this crap. If I'm stuck with that eyesore until 90 days is up, I'll just play Beat Saber until then and see what shakes out with the old version. It's a loss, but I got more than a year out of my $30. I'm reading reviews from people who only got a month with the good version and I really feel bad for them. These aren't reviews written by  trolls or naysayers, developers. Your new app actually sucks."

I use Fit Xr in combination with Supernatural. 

I love the way Supernatural spent more time and money in recording their trainers and they really help you in the immersive experience with their cheering and it gives me more cardio feeling than Fit. I think the avatar trainers are a very low quality option. 

I also love the Boxing aspect of Fit...your avatar trainers are very scary and brings the overall quality of the experience to a low one. 

Change those avatars trainers to real humans please"

It is worth every penny. 

This is very simple. Look what you get for your money; A LOT. I have not even used the dance sessions (not for me). Still, this ‚Äúgame‚Äù is simply great!

Hopefully, we can get more upstream music but tbh i like the music in game, opened me up to different artists. Keep up the amazing work FitXR.
Some more filtering between classes would be good. Like a full schematic page of all your classes you did, hit streaks, even date of releases so you can keep track of your progress. Think Joe Wicks day 1, day 2 ... day 100 workouts..."

 I also love the fact that I can work out in the comfort of my home. And the update that they did to include HIIT exercises is a great added addition to my workouts. 

 Thank you for creating such a fun game that allows people to work out who may not always have time for the gym or the motivation to go there."
1522,LadyHokage,"May 2, 2021 at 9:06 PM",1,"Boring, repetitive, and greedy","As someone who owns a supernatural subscription I can say that this is a far inferior workout, it was a good discount option but now that's its also subscription based its not worth it. Songs get repetitive and aren't that good. I find myself getting bored during workouts very easily while this isn't a problem I have with other fitness games. The dancing classes are awful, the avatar that you're supposed to mirror looks awful and ruins immersion. The dances also just aren't fun, dance central is a way more fun dancing game that has easy to follow moves. The avatars in the game actually look good and it feels like you're having fun dancing in a club with a ton of other people


If you want a good boxing workout then just get thrill of the fight for a flat $10. It's a much better workout, it's way more fun, feels way more immersive and real, and they you dont have a monthly subscription charge.


Basically everything this game does, other games do better. I wouldn't recommend this at its original flat $30 anymore. The fact that they're doing a subscription now is laughable and ridiculous. This game was good back when vr was in infancy and there weren't any other real options for a dedicated fitness game but now it's just a relic that charges you monthly

Update‚Ä¶ After a few months of being a sloth again due to injury/surgery I was finally able to get back on and try out the new updates to the app. Thanks for the free few months to check out all the new features‚Ä¶ Will see if I use it enough to subscribe monthly but looking good so far‚Ä¶ Would love to see some country music or perhaps some 60s/70s music that would be great also some personalization for the avatars would be nice.

1. Can't find the music pack I bought
2. Can't filter for short/mid/long workouts + intensity anymore
3. No clue how much contet will be left after the 90days free trail which started automatically
4. I did not buy this game to pay for it every month now!

Update1:
Tried the new daily classes. Feels like they added a random sequence of punches and squats to the boring new music tracks. Punches and music do not line up and I'm failing all the time."
1525,Mark,"Jun 13, 2021 at 10:45 PM",5,Changed my life,"Disclaimer: I know of no reward system for positive reviews. This is my honest opinion.

I started using FitXR in January of this year and the only problem I have had with it is talking myself in to NOT working out when I should be taking a break. There has been no form of exercise in my life, which is not short, which has been so compelling that I not only stick with it, but look forward to it every day. I am in the best condition that I have been in for the past 20 years. I have taken to recommending to people that they buy a Quest 2 just for this application.

Is it perfect? Nope. Of course not. Is it getting better? Absolutely! They made a mistake when they pulled the filter when the new UI was introduced. They heard the feedback and got it back in there within a few weeks. It's still not entirely as intuitive as the previous version, but it gets the job done and it let them focus on delivering the HIIT studio. I think the commentary system could use some work and will be providing some feedback to the team shortly. And that is another big positive here. The company has multiple paths for providing feedback. And they clearly pay attention to them all. But writing software is hard and takes time. Users need to be patient.

Finally, on the switch from the DLC to subscription model. If your thought is the new model is too expensive then you have to ask yourself ""compared to what?"". Compared to an app? Sure. Compared to a gym membership. Not at all. Especially since it is the equivalent of a gym membership that you will actually continue to use. And don't most of us spend more than $10 a month on things like coffee or beer or whatever optional consumption is in our lives?

This application is worth the cost. In fact, it is pretty inexpensive compared to the value it delivers."

Now not only do I not have what I paid for because I paid for ongoing updates gear towards FedEx r has a non-subscription service now I'm still using FitXR, but guess what now there's no sound.
This is the worst experience I've had in gaming in my life.
I would not recommend this product or this company at all horrible and they're not even addressing the issues they're all acting like they didn't do anything wrong. They didn't even announce that they were going to start a subscription service so that the people left behind would be able to buy the addition facts before it was shut down. And now you can't buy them. Who in the world is making the decisions at FITXR?
Despicable.
UPDATE
Now multiple people are being charged for the subscription already on their credit cards.
We were told in 90 days we would be given an opportunity to opt in otherwise we would never be charged.
It should not be legal for a company to sign me up for something without me clicking yes I want to do that.

But at least I could find my exercises by selecting the lenght of the workout and the music style.
Now with the update these filters are gone ... you got to search 104 Workouts ! The only filter that exist is to sort by trainers ... which is useless, I do not care about the trainer I care about the music and length of the workout. 
Get the filter function back ! BTW how do you want to justify 10 Euro per month with the current quality of the program. I guess you have taken the wrong turn with a greedy manager and acutally burried a promising game.

Please note, first you got to deliver quality then people will pay.  Look at the comments and you will see what the community thinks about what you are doing. If customers walk away they usually will not come back."

Creating new daily content is the way to go for fitness apps and it makes sense for me to transition towards a membership model.

As a daily user for the last 6months I was hoping for new music and workouts which the developers have now delivered and will continue to add daily to the app. This is definitely worth the subscription cost if used regularly! 

They have also added multi player which isn't a feature I'll use but it's something people have been requesting for a long time, on top of this no subscription fee is needed to have this feature and everything else you previously had access to if you already own the app.

From the reviews its clear people can't deal with change but I think developers have done a great job and have shown commitment to making the app reach its full potential. Without a subscription based service they would ultimately need to focus on new products to keep a revenue incoming.

The only feature that is a downgrade from the previous version is being able to filter the workouts to easily find one that matches the time/difficulty or music you feel in the mood for and hope it is added again soon. Other than that everything has been improved across the board!"

Sorry but even without taking the subscription model into account the new menu clearly is more down- than upgrade. Did you really think cutting the filters for intensity, length and genre would add to the user experience? Well let me tell you a secret: it doesn't! The New title screen isn't even much to look at and the trainer pictures are all blurry (at least on Quest 1). Oh yes you promised a new surrounding...  Now that's nice! Wait...  You just switched out the daylight for an existing surrounding...  Really? That is what you call the biggest update in FitXR history? 
Now for the subscription model. Not cool!!! First of all this should have been communicated in advance! You're telling us nobody who bought FitXR will be loosing anything? That is not true. I always wanted to buy new song packs as soon as my fitness level would match them. Especially I was interested in the Rock pack. Now I can't get it except I decide to switch to the subscription model. I don't lose anything? But I do! I lose the choice on which songs I like to spend my money on. Instead you offer me random songs each day. Well keep that I mainly want rock songs. 

Sorry devs that's not the way to treat loyal customers. To be honest I really would like my money back, that's how disapointed I am.

It went from a very professional, well thought out program, to something that looks like students were let loose. The interface used to be a great lobby. Now, it's a dark void lacking imagination. It's hard to navigate. If this had been my first experience, I would have request a refund. I can't do that now, so I'm stuck. Oh well, hopefully I can save someone else some money with this review.

Response to the developer: you break your software and your answer is your going to make this piece crap better? Really? Your boat sinking. In my original review, I didn't even get how inside the game how glitching it is. It has hiccups, and slow feedback on a punches, etc. . . You can change it all you want, I won't know it, cause I won't be using it. I'll load it up in 1 week from now. If it's not the old interface, I'll never use it again."
1540,Mazerith,"Apr 16, 2021 at 2:10 PM",1,Horrible update,"Changed my review from 4 starts to 1. The latest update changed many things for the worse, sucking all the fun out of it.

Some of the changes:
- Performance drop
- Game suddenly turned into a subscription. That's not a bad thing, but the way they pushed this through is pretty bad. Almost scammy.
- I received a 90 day free trail (looks like they added that after complaints) but it's set on auto-renewal. 
- The home interface took a big hit. It's impossible to sort or filter classes, so you randomly have to click 20 times before you find what you want. I'm talking about workout time, difficulty and music genre. As an UX designer myself, i would fire the manager or designer responsible for this right on the spot. This is one of those 'you had one job' cases. 
- The interface still has no quit button.
- Multiplayer changed so now you're playing by yourself, which is not fun. Instead of joining a class, you now create a 'room' which can fill up. It doesn't and if you start the class you are by yourself.
- You get a room code and you can join other rooms if you have codes. However, there is no way to share these except manualy with maybe your friends. There's no public room list that you can look through. It's nice being able to play against friends, but this is not the way to do it.
- Noticed in the settings that there's an option enabled to play against prerecorded players. Didn't seem to do anything and makes you wonder if multiplayer was ever even in the game.
- For some unknown reason they decided to disable the quests' hardware volume buttons. You can only change the volume in the menu.

I'm sure that there are more crappy new things in this update, but i quit after attempting to do two workouts. Playing by yourself doesn't really motivate at all."

1545,Caroline,"Apr 17, 2021 at 12:46 PM",1,Disrespectful developers - Beware,"I bought the game a while ago because they weren't a subscription type like Supernatural. I was planning, with my budget, to buy a few DLCs from them that I would keep long term.

Without notice, they changed the formula to subscriptions. Ok, we get that the subscriptions are optional and that multiplayer will technically be for everyone. We understand that the developers are working hard and that they need funds to develop further.

But by removing the choice to buy DLCs, and if I may insist again that it was made without notice, the developers were totally disrespectful of their loyal customers. We would have really appreciated to get the choice.

Mine is made. I fortunately did not update the game and I will stick with the old version. I would have gladly have paid for DLCs but now I will put my money elsewhere. I don't care if I don't have the multiplayer option and the ""free trial"". 

This makes me sad because the game is great, really! But I feel betrayed and robbed by the developers' actions.

Developers: Please change your mind and give us the choice to buy DLCs again! I might give a second chance (and other customers too!).

EDIT: Following the response of the developers who thinks that it is ""better value"", I beg to differ. The fact is that you forced us a change that we, users, do not want. You don't seem to understand that WE WANT THE CHOICE of buying DLCs or to subscribe. I prefer to have 4 courses that I own rather than  a billion workout that I won't have the minute I choose to opt out because let's be honest, 120 per year (maybe more 160 for me since I'm Canadian) is an outrageous and unsustainable long term price.

1549,Christian,"Apr 25, 2021 at 1:01 AM",1,Good but not $10 monthly good. Don't buy,"Let me get this out of the way first: I loved FitXR when it was BoxVR, and I still liked the new FitXR features. However, plain and simple the developers need to get this message:
It is a good app, yes, but no exercise app is worth $120 a year. It just isn't. As a college student, I could justify paying $20 for this when I first got it; it was a lifetime purchase and subsequently I could play it for as long as i wanted. When I showed my VR headset to friends, FitXR was one of the things they liked most and I  was happy to recommend it to people. FitXR even made real sales off of that. With the new subscription model it just isn't worth it unless you're rather well-off. While there are a lot of people in the VR space who are rich enough to afford this, the overwhelming majority (myself included) are likely not. It's a disappointment more than anything; I loved this title back when it was a pay-once and go operation. If they had the old set of workouts you could get if you paid once and then gain access to all these new ones that'd work much better. As it stands I have to say that I personally won't be renewing the trial; I don't have that kind of money. If you're looking at this app and wondering if it is worth it, IT IS NOT. I'm disappointed in this change deeply because now I can't recommend this app to anyone anymore and if I ever show someone or if they ever want to try it and ask about it I have to say that ""yeah I got this experience but you have to pay a heck of a lot more now so I'd steer clear because of price alone."" I get you're a company and you have to turn a profit, but surely there's a better way to generate revenue than kicking everyone off who isn't rich, right? I mean if you want to have room for expansion as VR becomes more accessible you're going to need a cheaper tier if not an alternative that ditches the subscription model altogether. I'm sad to see this change and will update my review if things get better."
1550,Polzy,"Apr 24, 2021 at 11:34 AM",1,Not what anyone asked for,"You read the PR spin that suggested that the reason for the update/subscription model is because fans asked for it. Based on recent reviews I am clearly not alone in not being one of those fans. No-one asked for this. 

How much are Facebook paying you for this experiment? It's clear that a number of games went live with this model, all at the same time, all of different genres, clearly to see what games it works on. 

You released a game that clearly wasn't production ready to hit the timeliness of the subscription model being opened up by Facebook. You don't have the HIT classes ready, you removed base functionality like filtering, and added numerous performance issues. While you say these will be patched in the weeks to come...the fact you blindsided your so-called loyal fan base speaks volumes of your deceptive content."

The game you've paid for and they extras that you've already bought are your own. You have a choice to pay for a subscription monthly. 

I do not understand why people think they are entitled to slate a developer for adding an extra part to the app. 

I pay for DLC if I want to on other apps. Most of the music needs to be licensed for them to use which costs money. Updating and giving extra content costs money.

In all buy the game and if you want to pay for a subscription that will release new content every day, then pay for it.

Just understand with every update that happens there will be bugs and they don't and won't know about them until after they've updated the app. This happens with every game/app that comes out. Hence we get updates. üòèü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

  They can't create new content without funds coming in. No business can.

Enjoy the work outs try the trial once it's over its your choice what you do. 

Just remeber the subscription element is a choice they aren't holding you hostage to buy into the new model. 

If you are from the gaming world you already know finished games rarely get updated. Because they just make it in to a series like COD, Sonic, need for speed, GTA. 

Just don't slate them because they are expanding their platform for your benefit."
1552,Pitters,"Apr 16, 2021 at 7:53 PM",1,Shame on you,"90% of your customers bought this game because it WASNT subscription based. We already had Supernatural for that, and they‚Äôre not doing very good.. you duped us. We bought this for the updates and dlc and funny, but I was actually going to buy one of them today! Lol. Not anymore! Now we can‚Äôt even buy the dlc and of course, this means there won‚Äôt be any new ones in the future like promised. If you wanted to create a new game, then that‚Äôs what you should have done, not change the one people already bought. Your automated response to the new 2000 1star ratings just shows you don‚Äôt care about your customers either. I will be asking for my money back every single day until I get it. Not another penny will go to you from me. I suggest no one else gives you another red cent either. You deserve to go bankrupt after this and I hope you do.


Update: thanks devs for proving my point with the automated reply! Nothing you say now can be trusted since you keep changing the game. You‚Äôve lost our trust. The only way to regain it is give us our money back and let us CHOSE if we still want your product. Not force it down our throat. you should be ashamed of yourselves. You about to get sued!!"

So I cannot play the stuff I payed for 3 days ago.... And because I played for more then 2 hours my money is gone and I got nothing.. this is really rip off..

This compagnie is just money hungry..
I bought stuff before it was locked behind a pay wall..
And lost most songs.. 
As you can see i get the mag mail us... Bleh bleh bleh..but they don't reply or fix things
You cannot filter song you actual can play.. songs I payed for... I have to search for them..
They say they have big plans... But in the mean time keep us paying the full amount..
I accepted the pay thing and I got 2 weeks free trial instead of 90 days.. so I stopped it.
Allot of things in game say coming soon.. But hey we do let you pay for it even though you purchased a full game..
I am keeping my eye on the stars of the game.. and all the pissed people speak for them selfs..
The game it self is fun but not worth 9.99 a month fun..
Make the price what it's worth that's at least 1/2 of what your asking now..
But hey.. your money horny so that won't happen
.. just because of this greedy behavior I would give negative stars iff I could... And this is the first game in years I give lower then then 4 stars and I rated allot."

1556,JonPaul,"May 8, 2021 at 4:56 PM",1,"It's a great workout, but...","Update #2:  removed another star.  Filters added to disappointment to see only 7 hip hop boxing workouts....none of which are expert.  I'm not sure the Immortal workout should even count as Hip Hop.  BoxVR had way better music.  Went back to BoxVR Legacy today and enjoyed it way more.  

Update:  removed a star due to FitXR becoming a subscription model.

I love FitXR, but it seems like a downgrade from when it was BoxVR.  

My biggest complaint is that they removed custom playlists.  On BoxVR, I had made several playlists that were over 60min. long.  A great part of making your own playlist was that you could shuffle the songs each play through to change things up a bit so the workout wouldn't get stale.   BoxVR had some great songs that I can't seem to find and might have been removed (is ""Don't Fall Asleep"" still in this game?).   At $9.99 each, the addon packs are over priced.  I'm sure they charge that about due to the # of new songs you get, but since you can't create a custom playlist with them, you're really only getting a hand full of new work out sets.  Some of those ne sets may only be 3min in length.  and none over 20min.   

Next, BoxVR had 3 backgrounds to choose from.  FitXR only has 2.  Seems odd they wouldn't at least include the original 3 to give you a total of 5 backgrounds.

Lastly, FitXR added a dance feature.  Not sure who was asking for this, but from the other reviews I've seem, doesn't look like many.  I've tried it twice and found it not that fun.  Maybe it's better for people with outside body tracking, but, most people with VR headsets use inside out tracking.   According to STEAM harware survey, almost half VR users use Quest 2 or a Rift S.

Fingers crossed that some of my complaints are being worked on for a future update."
1557,BatshitCrazyGal67,"Jun 6, 2021 at 8:26 PM",5,AMAZING WORKOUTS,"I personally couldn't be happier with this game/workout. I used my free trial to look around and try everything out and can honestly say when my trial ended I looked at all the games to make sure I got what was best for me. In the end I truly missed the intensity and thrill this game provided. I found it very easy to maneuver within the app and easily locate what I wanted or needed. Everything is labeled as to what you want....boxing, dance, etc. And if I like it I make it a favorite. Also you can choose by amount of time you want to exercise. It clearly shows leaderboards, counts what you burn,  gives you speed of punches etc. I started at 3 minutes of beginner and am now at 24 minutes advanced. I look and feel so much better and i look forward to my workouts (2 a day) every single day. Thanks for an amazing fitness game that I can be excited about every day"

Love the new subscription option.  $10 a month is cheap for the quality of the experience.   There are a few things to iron out like a filter for workout intensity but they say it's coming.  Most the negative reviews are from people who have not even given the change a chance but they get to keep everything they have and are getting more with this update.
1559,Prentiss,"Jun 26, 2021 at 10:00 AM",4,Opinions from a internet boxer,"I use this game as part of my workout. I also have Thrill of the fight, and had Creed for a short while....but returned it. I get more tired playing Thrill because it's more intense...at least the way I play it, but BoxVR is more of a structured workout. It's not as intense as Thrill, but I feel like it's a more well rounded workout,  forcing me to do squats and head dodges, where as with Thrill I can get away with less leg movement . I love using both ""games"" as it keeps things interesting and they both offer a great workout...if you put effort into it.

 I usually mute the included music and just play my own, not that the music was particularly bad, I just like to be in control of what music I play when I workout. 

I returned Creed because it's less of a boxing simulation workout and more of a arcade game, which isn't bad if that's what you want...and it was fun, but I use these boxing ""games"" mostly just for exercise  and not for pure entertainment, so it wasn't for me.

Back to BOXVR: 
When I first downloaded this game, it had some issues with freezing randomly when I would try to start some classes within the game, but I haven't had the same issue since the last update so I'm giving this game a full 5 stars. I hope the devs continue to add to the game with more dlc's and also additional workout rooms. As far as I'm concerned, this game is worth the price!

Update :  now the game uses a monthly subscription model which I'm not exactly excited about, but I will use up my 90 day trial and decide if I want to subscribe. The game has been improved since the last version. I like the new boxing studio options, because I was getting bored with the one before the new update. Other improvements are  better music selections, and the intensity is greater than it used to be (if you choose an advance class) so you can get a better workout."
1560,Rocco,"May 5, 2021 at 3:13 PM",2,An honest review from a BoxVR owner,"I already own BoxVR on Steam and while I loved it, the fact that it was tethered always annoyed me. Recently I began playing it over Virtual desktop, which is ok, but not best. I was really interested in getting FitXR on Oculus and I noticed it went free, so why not? Compared to the PC version, the mobile version is way funnier and more comfortable, I also appreciate all the additions except that it seems I am unable to play without ""others"" around, it can be annoying.
Then I get an email about the subscription and I saw the price. Considering I got BoxVR for 20‚Ç¨ back then, and that FitXR itself was 24‚Ç¨, this is a big nono for me. The cost is absurd and the fact that it's a subscription is super annoying, summed up with the cost of sweat absorbers you probably want to use to preserve your Quest. As a fellow developer, I'm sorry to give 2 stars because the game is good indeed, but the business model behind is just non sense. Just make it a one-time purchase with some extra premium features if you really want to offer personalized trainings. I don't need those, I don't need to feel forced to train every day to justify the price and I don't need to get stressed about remembering to top-up my prepaid for yet another service I may forget to have.

1562,LONE EAGLE,"May 29, 2021 at 5:28 PM",5,Love the new new HIIT studio,"I am relatively new to the Oculus System and brought my headset mainly for working out and a game or 2. I have read some of the reviews and fail to understand why there are so many negative reviews! Don't get me wrong I understand that long time users may be upset by subscription based model but from what I read if you purchased content that it does not go anywhere and you do not have to subscribe, the developers have stated this over and over again.  I personally like that you get updates / DLC via subscription instead of paying separately for it. 

I ran thru all 3 of the intro HIIT workouts and am running with sweat. Would I like to be able to use my own music, of course but that is not an option and I can live with that and it is no reason to give the game / app a 1 star rating. I mean come on!! there are new workouts daily! Just my 2 cents worth.  I saw that some people said there was no music in HIIT studio, check your sound settings, Mine did the same thing and I turned music back up and no issues. 

I have been using for about a month and really have enjoyed the daily workouts and looking forward to new HIIT workouts."

I know that it‚Äôs another subscription but content is added all the time and people need to get paid. 

Would be great if it can connect to my Ant+ Heart-rate monitor (not sure if there is support for this on the Oculus) and connection to Strava for workout posting within the App rather than on my watch.

Other than that, great job and keep up the good work."

But they completly messed up the UI and removed important features. 
Before the update you could filter your courses based on duration, intensity, music style etc... 

Now you have a plain wall with 100+ courses , most of them <15 minutes. Searched a while but did not found my 45 min + courses. The filtering and favourites were completly removed. 

Did a boring course without squats etc... because I was annoyed by clicking to the courses. Totally unmotivating and disappointing.

1570,ab,"Apr 20, 2021 at 9:53 AM",1,Developers continue to downgrade,"When I first bought boxvr there was a function where you can build your own playlists. I thought it was great worked well and I didn‚Äôt have to play ten minutes of multiple workouts to find out that they were boring playlists.  Then they changed names and took that away. 
That update actually smoothed some bugs by streamlining the environment. I then had to continue to play workouts to find 20 or so that didn‚Äôt feel like I was shadow boxing in a elevator. Those workouts were great but took awhile to find what I liked. 
Now it‚Äôs a subscription based game with the same core mechanics as boxvr but with less. The menu makes it harder to find a workout by genre and time frame. No custom playlists. No way of knowing if the workout I selected is going to have a bunch of songs that I find boring. No list of favorites. 
The new workout I played was a pretty good playlist so maybe if that keeps up I might improve my rating. If hiit is going to be like the dance workouts I‚Äôll say hard pass on this $120 a year game. And it‚Äôs uncertain what the developers will take away next in there updates. With all the downgrades from the original game I‚Äôll recommend not getting this game because it‚Äôll definitely won‚Äôt be adding any useful features."

I honestly can‚Äôt understand what they were thinking removing the ability to filter based on time and difficulty, as well as by if the workout included squats or not. 

The new app is just a terrible user experience and I‚Äôm honestly going to be trying to get a refund as this is not what I paid for when I bought the app (back when it was BoxVR). 

It‚Äôs really gone downhill since then and I‚Äôll be looking for alternate apps to get a boxing style workout."

1574,Xavier Rivera,"Apr 25, 2021 at 2:17 AM",1,Horrible and confusing,"This was the one thing I enjoyed on the oculest. I have been using this app and loving it- I was able to tailor my workout to remove squats as I have a bad back  and am concerned of my back going out during play time. With the new format I can no longer do that. I am so disappointed. The one thing I looked forward to doing is gone. I despise everything about this new format and it‚Äôs invitation. I want what I paid for - nothing more nothing less.

***UPDATE- I changed the class settings and turned squats OFF - but it is not working. Instead of ruining the experiences of customers you ready have- you should have just launched a volume too if the game and saved all of your customers going through this. The settings worked just fine before the update- despite turning squats off- the settings remain unchanged. I have had this app since December and enjoyed it until now. Greed is something serious. Leave the original app alone and give customers what they paid for or refund the money. Launch a volume 2 or whatever and save all this nonsense.

***It has been a week. I am still unable to disable squats. Despite turning system on and off- the class settings indicate squats are OFF but as I play the case- the squat option is very much active. I emailed support - last email was Thursday morning where I provided my app ID again- still no response."

I just wanted to do a quick workout, I thought about something like 5 mins, rock, advanced, but... of course filtering is gone and after tons of clicking and not finding what I want I just turned off my oculus. It‚Äôs really beyond my understanding why did they remove the filtering? And their search function is useless, I tried typing in ‚Äúrock‚Äù and I got tons of non-rock related courses. I guess it‚Äôs the time to evaluate competitions‚Äôs apps.

I bought this for my parents over the weekend and now that money is wasted.

Release fitxr2 or premium and leave this perfectly fine app alone. Greed of developers ruins a good thing. Real disappointment for what was my favourite quest app last year. Appears to be set to auto renew as well which is a sleazy tactic.


I go back and forth on this title, it's a simple and great idea that has got me working out more than ever before. I think it is good and I've enjoyed my time with it.

But, a lot of the songs and the maps are quite mediocre which can ruin the flow and cause some of the longer sessions to be a bit boring. It's probably a bit pricy for what it is and what is in the standard package. I would love this game if it had custom maps or fewer songs that sound like they are royalty free.

I have been busy with life & hadn‚Äôt played for awhile,so I was shocked to see that this is now subscription robbery.

1580,Teri Baynes,"Jun 3, 2021 at 4:04 PM",5,I STILL LOVE this app!,"Note: This is my update to my review, since there have been changes to the business model and additions to the concept for this app. 
I STILL LOVE this app!!!  I try to use it 2-3 days per week, and my HR max is getting lower, so I know I am in better shape because if it. I also use HoloFIT and Supernatural, and FitXR is STILL my favorite.  I do NOT mind a subscription fee and $9.99 is very reasonable as long as FitXR regularly delivers fresh, quality content, and I think they will.   

The boxing studio is still my favorite.  Gosh‚Ä¶who knew it could be sooooo satisfying to punch little orbs? ü§£. It‚Äôs addictive.  And I totally loose track of time while I‚Äôm playing in it.  I did turn off the trainers‚Äô voices before the update since I found them distracting they did not add value to the experience.  (Hopefully they‚Äôve improved in the new boxing classes.). But I really enjoy the rest of the experience.

I love the new HIIT studio‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to get kinda sloppy on the squats in SN, and in the FitXR boxing the flying boards are more of a suggestion to duck than to do a full squat.  But there‚Äôs no cheating on them in the HIIT studio‚Äîthe orbs won‚Äôt light up if you don‚Äôt squat low enough.  And the faster you can squat, the faster they light up.  So it‚Äôs motivating to get the form right, and then get the HR up.  And it‚Äôs FUN.  And the instructor coaching is much better than they were in the older boxing classes.  The studio is beautiful as well.

I tried the dance studio and I‚Äôm a total spaz, so I don‚Äôt do it as much. But it provides a wider range of motion and greater variety of movements, so it‚Äôs certainly worth suffering through the embarrassment to do it once or twice a week.  If you love to dance or do aerobics classes, you‚Äôll probably love the dance studio.

If I HAD to choose a SINGLE VR fitness subscription app, it definitely would be FitXR.

Original review from late 2020:  
Full disclosure‚ÄîI‚Äôm new to VR and just got my quest about 3 months ago, so I never had the BoxVR app to which other people compare this. However, every single time I play this, I end up getting a decent workout and am drenched in sweat when I finish.  This morning I played a variety of classes for a total of about 70 minutes, averaged 153bpm with a max of 179bpm, so it‚Äôs almost as good as a spin class for my cardio (I‚Äôm 59 and female).  You‚Äôll get out of it what you put into it.  Definitely will be using this more frequently as the weather cools and I cycle less outside."

I understand FitXR‚Äôs desire to be a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù Oculus/VR fitness offering. However, the way they sprung the changes onto the community, the way their new model leaves people who need a DLC model completely behind (fixed income, people who need to spend on their own timetable, among others), now the way they are dealing with feedback, and some other decisions as part of this roll-out process that I just cannot support have led me to change my review score.

Original review:


I have been using VR for a while now during the pandemic for exercise, I have an Oculus Quest 2 that replaced a CV1. I really enjoy this app, and would wholeheartedly recommend it for anyone looking to try or use VR for exercise.  I am looking forward to seeing future content and improvements.

Reasons I can't give 5 stars, yet: Tracking is very good, and the addition of manual adjustments was welcome, but it is still frustrating to see a hit not register. I would also like to see more content that works the full body that isn't dance. Most of the boxing workouts seem cardio-focused and will work your shoulders.  Dance in fact gives a much more rounded workout, but not all of us are comfortable with it.

Quibbles, quibbles, quibbles, though! If you want to try VR exercise this is one to have in the stable. I use this with Beat Saber (warm-up/cool down), and Thrill of the Fight (more extreme cardio)."

I absolutely HATE that they have gone the route of a subscription based model and did so without any forewarning to loyal, long time users, bought this as BOXVR which I absolutely loved.  And now it‚Äôs a complete mess.  Hope the devs reconsider this poor decision.  No way am I paying a subscription fee.  

And why did you remove the option to purchase the dlc packs?  Why not just keep those?  You could easily keep offering the occasional dlc option to users who do not wish to purchase a subscription.  

I used to recommend this app, no more.

Too many apps are going the way of subscription, who can afford that????

I get it its your business but you are losing trust, something really difficult to regain.

I lost my paid packages music.   Which I LOVED!!! Now filtering is super stupid, impractical, cool interface but not really intuitive but specially... NO ZERO communication about what's next for the people like me that paid full app price and packages.... I do notnlike the monthly crap payment... that's why FitXR was the bomb!! I get it, you also decided to go for $$$ instead of happy customers but th we te is a reason why people used to leave gyms... leading reason: monthly payments and time --- and you got it all... Fun, cost forward, cool packages and cheap but is disappointing you let supernatural lead the way.... 

I need to know what is going to happen, where are my packages and if we are going to be limited and forced to move to the monthly payments at some point at least be decent and send my money back....its just fair for a poor transition plan affecting all your existing client based...."
1592,MrMayhem1,"Apr 13, 2021 at 11:41 PM",5,My absolute favorite.,"I'll give down my list of what this is my absolute favorite. And also, some constructive criticism for updates. 

1. I can't stand going to the gym, nor do I like wasting my money on it. With that being said, I've known about BOXVR and it transitioned to FITXR. While I haven't tried the dance, I've been doing the boxing portion of FITXR for about a month and a half. With proper calorie intake, I've lost almost 15-20 pounds. 

2. It's nice to be able to be on your lunch break (I work from home) put this on, and hammer out a good workout for 30 minutes. I have no complaints in regards to the game it's self.  I consistently do 30 minutes each day except for Saturday where I tend to do an hour. 

Overall? if your looking to have some fun working out, and a good challenge, this is it! 

What can improve? 
Just simply add more tracks, more songs, more levels of light, intermediate and intense. I don't want to get bored by doing the same one's over and over again so if we could add some more? that'd be fantastic. With that being said, I haven't ran into that issue but I do see how it could be an issue in the near future."
1593,Stina,"Jun 9, 2021 at 7:40 PM",4,New HIIT feature is a terrific addition,"HIIT was a bit glitchy for me, during one of the rounds, only two targets appeared in the whole segment, but that'll get fixed. I like this aspect of their offering the best. It helps you perfect form and engage more core muscles. I had found myself warming up playing Beat Saber, then moving onto boxing workouts on FitXR, but those sessions were not as appealing to me. But, this new feature will bring me back each time I work out."

How do I get my money back for this game? You ruined it months ago with that update, and now you want me to subscribe to something?  This is not the game I bought. I would like my money back please. 

Old review:

While I appreciate the attept to make Box VR better, I‚Äôm thoroughly confused at why you changed the entire thing rather than just offer this update as its own game.

Why can‚Äôt I see a leaderboard? In absence of a functional multiplayer system in the old version (because you had to wait forever for others to join), I often would take note of my place in the standings and try to beat my own score and work my way up the leaderboard. Now, I cant do that because the only score I see is an in game leaderboard with a bunch of fake opponents, and then my own score at the end.
This makes this game useless for me. 
I bought Box VR because of the stellar reviews and I used it almost every day in my workout. It was practically the only thing that gave me motivation to exercise. 
Now, I find it difficult to get into because i‚Äôm not challenged.
Please either add in the leaderboard, current calorie count, hit/miss count etc or bring back the old game."

I understand that I have access to all the content that I had before the update but I don't have any confidence that I won't lose this content in the future. 

This app/developers have history along these lines. It was once known as Box VR, that had a major overhaul on Quest and a name change that lost a lot of content and functionality and although the core game stayed the same, many people who purchased the application felt ripped off. Fix XR should have been a new app, therefore existing customers would have still have access to what they purchased. This update (and move to subscription) has done the same and should also be a new app. 

Forcing your existing users to upgrade to something they didn't purchase is not the way a trustworthy company works. I have purchased this apps twice over the last few years (once on Steam and once on Oculus). I will never pay for the subscription or give my money to this developer again."

I paid for fitXR before the change to the subscription model. I didn't buy any DLC content. It isn't clear if the PREVIOUS included-in-the-base-price-content will still be available to me after my 90 day trial period ends. Or will I only have the three free short songs - if so then I want a refund as this is a clear bait and switch. I specifically bought this game because it did not have a subscription model. 

I can't afford yet another $10/month subscription. There isn't even true global multiplayer like synthriders where you can hop in a lobby and find a group and chat. The user interface is objectively worse. Previously you could filter by song duration, intensity, class type. Now you have to manually scroll through each class. There also used to be a class of the day feature.

Edit: Thank you to the developer for the clarification that I will still have access to the previously available songs after my complimentary trial period ends, and that there is a plan to reimpliment filters.

Although I focus more on the boxing aspect, it is fun to try some of the other things like HIIT.  They have added more variety and useful options.  For instance the option to change the pause ability in-game.  Very useful because previously during an intense session I would inadvertently touch a button which would pause it. Completely throwing off your focus, then afterward try to time the resume to now miss the next target.

I have a request for the Devs. Is it possible to change the visibility of items in the HUD?  It would be nice to be able remove some or all the stats (STREAK, SCORE, etc).  The info barrage can be distracting.  Its like going to a weight scale hour.  I don't mind seeing progress at the end of the session, but sometimes I just want to enjoy the experience and not be distracted.  This would be similar to what Beat Saber uses, they have an option where you see only the block and obstacles and no stats until the end. I use this when I play and it makes it more enjoyable.   I am not suggesting removing it entirely. I do like to see it sometimes, but just an option to not display the results at the end."

  I do like the ability to change themes or areas you workout in, I like that feature and it would be really nice to do more with that. 
  I think you should go back to purchases instead of trying to do a membership. It awesome your trying to do more and incorporate more stuff in the app, but it feels more like it is forced than an option. It would be better to have packs so users have more freedom with their routines.
  I don't want to pay a year for all these workouts when I'm only using 1 or 2 of the workouts. It's a bit ridiculous to keep charging players who bought the game, along with extra content.

1616,poefboef,"Apr 29, 2021 at 1:40 PM",1,It is pretty good [updated: downgrade],"Let me start by saying that this is my go to app for a quick workout, but it is lacking in a bunch of areas. I find myself very bored at times because of the limited environments where I can work out. Previously BoxVR had a bunch of environments and other competitors also have a wider and more visually stunning selection that really transports you. Then paying $10 for only an hour of extra content which is painfully hard to discern from the normal content just makes it lose all the value for me. I recently bought the full body pack and I can‚Äôt find the specific sessions included in this pack. Either make them cheaper, beef the content up, or give me a way to browse to the content I purchased easily. A better range of workouts would be awesome too. I‚Äôve been getting into RealFit recently and it blows this away in many ways. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, I love FitXR and don‚Äôt regret the purchase, that what is in there is gorgeous. It just gets a bit bland. Personally, I think they should have split off the dance portion because I feel that targets a completely different demographic than the boxing crowd, but you‚Äôre stuck paying for it either way.

Update: This new subscription is knocking off 2 more stars here. I don‚Äôt want to be forced into a subscription that will have a bunch of content I don‚Äôt care about. The filtering in the new FitXR is absolute rubbish. Why can‚Äôt I just easily get to my downloaded content? Why is it near impossible to sort by the type of workout, duration, or intensity??

I was seriously thinking of paying a subscription to Fit XR for the new content, but as of now the navigation to get to the classes is really bad.

My first go was so disappointing. No way to choose between beginner, intermediate og advanced classes anymore. No way to see more than 5 seemingly random classes at a time, pressing a tiny arrow to get one more class into view. Takes ages to get to class 30. I gave up. No way to flick the joystick to navigate. Way better before the update.

Is this deliberate to make people stick to choosing the classes you recommend each day, many of them requiring subscription?

Is it true that buyers who have previously purchased need to experience 90 days of update content and pay monthly?

1625,Robert,"Apr 18, 2021 at 9:47 PM",1,Very Disappointed,"First of all let me say I really enjoy the boxing element of FitXR - its a great work out and a lot of fun.

However, when I started the app up a couple of days ago, I was horrified to discover the mess that had been made of the user interface (was any User Acceptance Testing actually undertaken?)
Then I after some further investigation I realised that FitXR was becoming a subscription service; no prior warning was given that this was going to happen.

If you are thinking of taking out a FitXR subscription my advice would be, do the math.  One year will cost you $120, two years $240, five years $600 and so on.
I think this is a lot of money of to a lot of people.  Responding to comments, the developer keeps repeating what good value for money this is, much better than
the no longer available add-on packs.  But stop paying and your access and investment is gone.  As aside is there a general demand for a new workout everyday?
As time passes, there will be thousands of workouts to wade through to find the ones your actually want to do.

I will not be taking out a subscription.  Judging from the comments I think this will be the case with a lot of existing FitXR app users.  I will continue to use
the app with the content I originally paid for (if I can find that content without jumping through too many hoops).  Had I have come across FitXR afresh, after
the change of business model, I would not take out a subscription; to repeat myself, $120 a year is a lot of money (you can buy Beat Saber, Oh Shape and Pistol Whip for less than that).

The question is, will FitXR survive on the low number of subscriptions likely to be taken out? Or, to be a little unkind, do the developers expect a continue drip of new subscribers to be
reeled in and pay their monthly sub for a few months before they get bored or realise how much FitXR is costing them?

P.S.  What I can quite readily understand is a small fee for on-line / multi-player; say $2 / month to cover server costs."

I also now can't sort my workouts by intensity level or by length or by music type now (without scrolling through pages and pages of workouts). I fail to see how this is an improvement - quite the contrary. In the end,  I don't understand why you would launch an update before testing it out thoroughly and ironing out (most of) the glitches. I also don't appreciate being forced to accept the 90 day trial. It seems I'm not alone here either based on many of the other reviews I'm reading.

I still have to sort through all the dance classes.   The other criticism I have is that they have a HIIT training module that continues to say coming soon so even though they offered us a 90 day trial obviously we won't be able to fully test that out since it's not available as of now.

I don't like the dance bit, so I've just been doing the boxing. The game takes aeons to load, which is annoying as there's no warmup, so I warmup in another game, but have cooled down by the time Fitxr eventually loads. I have to scroll through endlessly to find the beginners levels. The music is almost all terrible - sounds like it was chosen by a teenage boy. The game is visually uninteresting and unchanging. It's a shame as I do get a good physical workout, but my brain is bored. I'll stick to cardio level on Audio Trip, much more fun and I suspect a much more effective workout too."
1630,Ghostrobo,"Apr 16, 2021 at 9:57 PM",1,"Was a good game, now it‚Äôs the WORST","Just so everyone is clear when reading this, I stood by this app when it came out for the first time and it had five stars. However now after this crap if I could get zero stars I would but I can‚Äôt so imagine that one star is not thereüëç


You know the funny part in about three months there‚Äôs gonna be a question and here‚Äôs that question: FitXR who??  Must have been a bad app lol. Supernatural wait what‚Äôs that. Ya that‚Äôs what happened to the last company that pulled that crap. The big reason why everyone liked this game so much is because you didn‚Äôt have to pay monthly you bought the game you play the game and you got all the content if you want to DLC than you just  pay for it.

Update 4: dear community and developers, I just got a reply back from customer service and you know it‚Äôs so funny they tried telling me that the subscription is for our customers best value. üò°üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ yeah I don‚Äôt think so first of all if I have to go out of my way and pay for a subscription of $10 a month it is no longer in my interest is it. You guys are nowhere as near as big as Netflix or anything else that requires a monthly subscription. So stay out of the subscription business is not for you, this is of no one‚Äôs interest it‚Äôs not better for anybody especially all the customers who have already had the game. I bought the game when it first came out it was fun and then you guys change the name I was a little upset but whatever I stood by you guys. But now you pull some crap like this, it is absolutely disgusting and shameful that you guys think this is what your customers want. You guys should all sit down in a meeting rethink this and change something because as of right now you guys are going to be at one star in about a month and then no one‚Äòs gonna want to play your stupid game.

(Ps: everyone let‚Äôs try to get the game to 1 star maybe than they will start caring about the people again) 

 PS: let‚Äôs all get real here this is about money you guys want my money and that‚Äôs it there‚Äôs no value for the customers there is only doing this for you guys. I don‚Äôt think so you guys are doing this because you guys want more money because you want everybody to pay for a subscription of $10 a month yeah right. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ


Update 3: dear developer, yes I was part of that group that was requesting more stuff however we were not requesting to have to pay a monthly fee to play a freaking game. We won it was more music for the DLC‚Äôs that‚Äôs all not being able to pay $10 a month to play one game. It makes no sense, On top of that now for all the subscribers do the updates or do the DLC is all of us who don‚Äôt want to pay that because we‚Äôve already paid but we should have paid don‚Äôt get access to it. So give me the crap of all we were just trying to look out for the people. No you weren‚Äôt you just trying to make more money and how do you do that you get people to pay a monthly subscription to your game that‚Äôs how and honestly shame on you guys. You guys weren‚Äôt happy with people buying DLC‚Äôs whenever they want to do but now you‚Äôre going to cut out all the DLC‚Äòs and if you don‚Äôt pay for anything you don‚Äôt get anything that‚Äôs messed up.




Update 2: I went to your support page and I filled out a very stern and angry complaint. When you guys get to one star then look back on this day and think how stupid this decision was. I‚Äôll give it one month you may have gotten $40 from me but you‚Äôre not getting anything else from me and I hope all of you delete this game uninstall it and if you‚Äôre thinking about getting it don‚Äôt






Update: as you can tell I WAS a huge fan until the developers made a decision that is beyond dumb. The game was fine the DLC‚Äòs were great the game was good. Now I will be uninstalling it and letting it sit in my library. You developers should be ashamed of yourselves trying to take more money from your customers who paid money for the game and the DLC‚Äòs. Now whoever doesn‚Äôt pay for a subscription is missing out on content . So get your bloody heads out your rear. And start caring for your customers again. Maybe once you guys decide to fix it I‚Äôll play it again. üò§üò°üò°üò°


Absolutely ridiculous!!




The stuff on the bottom of the review was from before the stupid ducking update. Disregard that and if you read this then I don‚Äôt suggest getting a game






I have been playing this game for a while and I love it! It gets you moving and really makes you sweat if you push yourself, I like that the devs have add a DLC to this game for more music options. If you are looking for a great game and a workout this is a definite must have especially now.


I just finished playing the new FirXR and all I can say is wow!! This has completely changed the format of BoxVR in a great way. If you have not tried it then you are missing out. The multiplayer is pretty cool. They also added a few new songs and things to improve the workouts. 
Thank you Devs for such amazing update!!! ü§òü§ò

(Ps: this is a great game overall all, looking at the bad reviews shouldn‚Äôt turn you down all the time. If you don‚Äôt like it after a couple sessions than get a refund!)"
1631,Taylor,"May 29, 2021 at 11:40 PM",4,Great game that brings the gym home,"So this is a great game I wanted to rate it 5 stars but I could not because at the time of purchase I also bought the rock pack. I do not regret either purchase, but cannot recommend the music packs from my experience. The core game has great pumping electronic music to help keep you going, but the music choices in the rock pack slow at times and are actually way more country than Rock. I wish they would have charged a little extra and had strong motivational rock music for the pack. Closer to what beat saber does, but without limiting themselves to specific albums. I will say most of the tunes work a few are great, but I can say I would call it a rock pack. I listen to all kinds of music from electronic and even some country, but I don‚Äôt want to listen to country while I am working out in a Rock pack. This is a fantastic game and I am glad I supported them with my purchase and hope they continue to improve the game. The gameplay and both the dance and boxing workouts are great and fun. It seems like they do care about the project but some of the music needs some work. They have some great electronic and rap tunes that are so much fun in the core game. Keep up the good work! I hope I just purchased the weaker pack, but I don‚Äôt see myself purchasing another music pack to find out."
1632,Simon1976,"Apr 19, 2021 at 11:02 PM",1,Subscription Beta Version?,"I use many apps only occasional and so the subscription model isn't anything for me.  I have checked the oculus store regarding the (not so) ""premium subscription"". I would pay easiely about 50 bucks a month only for the already paid apps to use them actualy in a ""premium subscription"".  The current version seems to be not ready: Some  features are mentioned as coming soon. The whole experience on a oculus quest 1 seems to be a bit laggy.
So the current change of some apps to a subscription based model has stopped my future invest into a oculus quest 2. I will use the paid apps as long as they are not subscription based, but I will invest no further buck into apps of he oculus quest ecosystem. I will see if there are alternatives in the future from other companies. Otherwise there is still PCVR. But I say to this app and all other apps which started a premium subscription: Thank you, but that's a no go from my side. Even one star is now too much, because of the surprisingly changed business model. You force the paid customer into the subscription model for future use, because all already available DLCs have been also removed in the store."

Possibility to chose music and intensity has been gone for no reason. Do you have some kind of QA department or do you ask friendly customers first when you are deploying?

If you really want me to pay for an abonnement please hire some kind of UI-Designer and Quality Assurance Engineers with experience first and ask users what they want. My ""better half"" refuses to do any workout with FitXR because with the last update the user experience has changed totally. Even while loading and starting up the software meanwhile pictures are stuttering, worst thing you can have with a VR experience.

So if support guys are reading this, please deactivate my free trial. it is heavily overloaded without filters. Maybe then it will be a bit more useful than now.

Still my favorite exercise app. I plan to pay the monthly subscription to support new development, better music options, ability to choose songs and create playlist/workout lists. Miss the old option to see workouts listed in order of length, and to sort 

 I would like to purchase this for my son also, but don't want to commit him to the subscription model. That's the dilemma. 

Previous review: This is now my daily exercise app. It gives me the best sweat workout of any of my Oculus apps. I often add wrist weights to make the workout even more effective. The music synchronization to the action seems spot on.
First of all thanks to the developers for addressing two of my earlier requests ... saving favorite workouts, and different background environments. I really love the ability to compete against other players as it motivates me to try harder,

I have just a few requests for the developer:

1. Ability to choose an opponent or competitor from friends. (A one on one competition between friends would be awesome).
2. Ability to choose music


Thanks. Wonderful app!"

1647,Ofunk,"Apr 25, 2021 at 3:36 AM",2,New doesn't mean better,"Like many other, I was hesitating between Supernatural and FitXR for my go to workout game and ultimately decided to go with FitXr to avoid the hassle of an expensive monthly subscription and we all know how that went by now... Nonetheless, I thought I'd give it a chance after the update, hoping it would be worth the price.

I was immediately disappointed. Sure, everything looks nice with that minimal future neon vibe going on, but user experience was just thrown out the window to give your trigger finger a clicking workout. This is was VERY surprising considering that you just have to look at the competition and basically do the exact same thing...

Get ready to spend most of your time clicking through the menu, hoping that the class you're looking for is next because the menu is terrible. Dance classes will show up even when you've specifically selected boxing, you won't be able to filter by music genre, difficulty (at least not more than one filter anyway) or even sort the darn classes. I am amazed by how bad it is and I hope that they fix this very soon.

It's a big let down for me, even though the workouts themselves are fun and can be challenging.

So, if the dev team is going to read this, here's the takeaway:
- Fix the UX, just look at what supernatural is doing and it's already a major step in the right direction.
- Let us sort classes by difficulty, music genre, anything!!!
- The gloves up / block always feels very out of sync. I don't know if it's a delay in the sound or what, but it feels very unnatural and off-beat to me, anybody else?

If you're going to start charging a monthly fee, this needs to be polished and streamlined and fast. Best of luck."

I understand the drive from developers to subscription based model. And I‚Äôm disgusted by some comments saying that they spent months with this game, shared it with family and are now burning torches and attacking devs. It‚Äôs their product and they decide what works for them. BUT, oh and it‚Äôs a big BUT. These new changes should never come at the expense of their loyal customers. Taking functionality away from customers that paid for the game is just bad practice. People loosing access to content they paid for - should never happen. This shouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äúbug‚Äù. 
And workouts filtering. Seriously, who thought new UI is a good idea? It‚Äôs terrible, it‚Äôs taking away functionality from what was available before. How come no one noticed that it‚Äôs missing the most important filtering - ability to choose type and intensity of workout. I don‚Äôt want to scroll the list hoping I‚Äôll finally find something I‚Äôm looking for. I want to hop in and just exercise.
Last but not least - multiplayer. Previously I could choose if I want to exercise solo or with other avatars around me. Now, the multiplayer option just doesn‚Äôt work - you get your room code so you can invite friends but no stranger will be automatically added to your session. Terrible setback in game quality. 
This update is half baked and shouldn‚Äôt be released in this state. Apart from the issues listed above there‚Äôs also lack of content - almost every new feature says ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù. You lost your paying customers, now it‚Äôs time to win them back."

Then a full UI change and the best I can do to filter is click box. I can't filter by difficulty or length of class... These are very basic concepts and you lost them between old UI and new UI. Also, not a more fluid way to scroll though the options, have click the arrow for one movement until I finally find something doable.

Finally, I'm sick of the boxing glove sticking my face. I spend more time worrying where my hands are than paying attention to the targets, so I either miss because the glove stuck, I wasn't paying attention to the targets, or I'm not in a good stance."

I turned on my Oculus this morning to do my Box workout and was surprised to find a horrible experience, forced subscription model, and bad tracking. Rollback the update or give me an option to go back to what I bought. This is one of the worst experiences I've had with any Oculus app. If you're going to do subscription model then refund everyone that paid for it upfront.

**UPDATE 4/29***
I wrote in and was told I was ""removed from the 90 day trial"" - basically, that means you have the same crappy experience but now you're prompted to join their 7-day trial. All my paid for content is still impossible to find - they mixed it into the subscription stuff I don't want. So you have to scroll through 103 boxing classes to find the content you already paid to have. This was the answer.

Nice. FitXR - do the right thing and refund all the people that paid upfront for your product. You obviously have no intention of making it easy for us ""long term users"" to use what we paid to access.  

** Update 5/3 ***
OK, the latest patch hit and several items have improved. Content that is part of the subscription is showing with a lock. You no longer have to click into each one to find out what you own and what is subscription. Subscription content appears to be to the left (mostly). Music isn't stuttering but tracking is still off.

Since my content is back and somewhat easier to find I'm not nearly as mad as before. If they had gone out with this version it would have been better across the board but oh, well.

And with the wide range of classes there are favorites for everyone at all levels. I'm super excited for HIIT workouts.

1668,Sswats,"May 6, 2021 at 1:55 PM",2,Way too expensive for what you get.,"I purchased the base package 2 days before they introduced the subscription model. And the old interface was simple, but it had a filter to select classes based on level, which for some reason has been removed.

Now the game is fine, but its hardly WOW level of complexity. Its dots travelling at you with a person shouting encouragement. No huge 3d worlds, complex graphics etc. What they add monthly is dots travelling in different patterns at different speeds.  
They should have at least waited until the HIIT classes were ready before introducing subscriptions.
My gym membership is ¬£17.99 a month and this is is 9.99 a month so this is definitely not value for money for just a couple types of exercise
At most I would pay ¬£2.49 a month, but I am lucky i got the base package in time I'll just stick with that until I'm bored then move to something else.

Also if FITXR is successful then other games will change to a subscription method. So definitely not supporting this practice."
1669,Yondu,"Mar 9, 2021 at 9:13 PM",5,"Great game, TRACKING DOES WORK PERFECTLY","This is a great app. It's fun, but also it's a fantastic work out.

I do want to address a few things.

First, there's nothing wrong with the tracking in this app, the TRACKING IS FINE. The tracking on this app is BETTER than tracking in Beat Saber. The people who say there is don't understand how this game works. This game isn't just about accuracy, it's about the power and intensity with which you hit. If you're still unsure, go to settings, change to training and try again. I bet you don't miss any.  If you still do, try adjusting the gloves. (My only thing with this is the tutorial video should make that a little more clear.)

Second, there's a few or changes l'd like to see happen. I know the developers can't make every change every person requests, so I'm putting these in order of personal preference.

Please make YUR watch available.

Would love more variety in music. An 80s pack... Country music...

I would love targeted workouts. For example, upper body, core, legs, etc.

We should be able to sample the workouts that charge money. At the very least, I‚Äôd like to be able to at least hear the songs. But even better, would be nice to have one free play on one level in the paid workouts.

Show previous hit record in game, for any previous times played. Not just for the current game.

Right now, the start screen shows the highest level that can be reached in the workout, I'd like to also see total # of hits for the workout.

I'd love to see these things added, but even without them, it's a fantastic game.

Oh, and there's a 3rd thing... If you pause the game in between songs, it doesn't actually pause. The pause screen pops up, but then the next song starts and the punch balls move through it as if the pause screen not there. Only you can't punch them because it's paused.."

1671,Potters,"Apr 22, 2021 at 8:00 PM",2,Tl;dr: How do I downgrade to BoxVR?,"Update 4/2021:
First you replace the app we purchased with a different product. Now you switch it to a subscription based service? No. I'm very sad to see what is the opposite of what those who preferred BoxVR hoped for. Rating reflects customer treatment.

UPDATE 9/2020: The team got in touch with me and we had a very good dialogue. They care about this app, addressed my concerns, and have been regularly improving FitXR. We were also able to troubleshoot tracking issues to Oculus, which I confirmed across all my apps.

Original review:
First, I mean this: I loved BoxVR for workouts. When the community was asked what we'd like to see, I only wanted more environments. I was disappointed to see that there used to be fun things like punching skulls. So I was excited to try the update after a ""it's too hot in my VR room"" break, expecting only improvements.

Instead we have what is essentially the all new FitXR. One environment and tracking lag. Sure, there's extra visual fidelity with all the shiny bits, but this I can only assume is the reason behind the new lag. Even on basic tracks, many times my hand passed through targets, hearing the spheres ""hit"" a second after they pass behind me, like the main loop is catching up. That's if they registered. Aesthetically, I'm not fond of the new one-size-fits-all style, especially if it is costing frames. Whatever the case, I am a bit disappointed. I think this should have been introduced as a new app, not a forced replacement.

What would make me happy? Performance settings. Let me turn off those new glowy bits and up the tracking priority. And for goodness sake, speaking of backgrounds, please stop taking them away. We've gone from 6 to 3 to 1.

Or, as another reviewer put it, please give us a BoxVR mode (or similar) that brings back the old styles and options. Or, if it is a different codebase with a clean break, just give me back BoxVR, and I'll separately try FitXR. That would be an easy way to make a lot of people happy."

Next morning I woke up and all my body felt worked out. My leg muscles, back muscles, triceps, shoulders and abs. So very happy and look forward to trying much more. 
I used to be ultra fit and compete in ironman but changed job and lost it all but with the help of this app I'm sure I will get some fitness back easily.

1680,Klyok,"Apr 18, 2021 at 9:26 PM",2,Why strip away basic features?,"My passionate relationships with the app: ""Ok, FitXR, I have 30 mins, lets do lengthy advanced boxing workout as usual!"" ‚Äî ""Here you are‚Äîa carousel with 90+ boxing workouts with no filters."" ‚Äî ""Am I now supposed to click through all this tiles trying to remember every workout that match my current preference? Where did your filters go, FitXR?"" ‚Äî ""F%ck off, eat my dickscription!"".
Devs, have you ever did beta testing for your updates? Wasn't there any beta tester who makes use of such a basic routine: launch app, select workout type, duration and intensity, start workout?
Are your app's data really suggest that most of your users pop in and select a random workout?

Also, do you know what is cool about DLC? You see what you're buying!
I don't need NEW workouts EVERY DAY. But sometimes I want to have some new workouts of the TYPE I WANT, not the type you decided to throw into the subscription. And I was happy to buy all the Boxing DLCs.

I make use of a fraction of the content you have: intensive, lengthy boxing. Will I get something of this in your subscription? You're switching your users to subscription‚Äîand those, who will use it, essentially, have a very specific obligation to pay a specific amount of money every month. Do you have a similar specific obligation in return? No, you don't! Do you know what you deserve for ""a new class released every day?"" Some money paid every period of time! How much, what period? Dunno, stay tuned for future payments!

Is stripping away filters actually the upgrade you want to make? Will the next upgrade be stripping away any classification at all? Y'know, it will fit very well in your ""random class every day"" subscription. What's next in your upgrades list? No choice for the user at all‚Äîjust open the app, and you will be thrown into a random class? How about disabling countdown timer? It's so much fun to do not know what to expect next and when you'll finish what someone started for you.

Then it became FitXR which I wasn‚Äôt a fan of, but at least I could just avoid the dance stuff and still sort through the classes the way I needed to and I could find my classes. This new subscription based app is the worse interface to date.

You auto-enroll everyone in your subscription scheme as a thank you? I‚Äôve already spent like $80, maybe more on this app with all the packs and what not and now you say based on all the other dismal reviews we still have our packs. The problem is we can‚Äôt find them because now we have to scroll painfully 1 by 1 to look through it all. So you say we have it but I don‚Äôt remember all of the classes in those packs so we have to take your word for it.

Seriously. Worst UI upgrade ever. You removed all of the sorting features? What meeting did you all get together and go yeah, let‚Äôs remove the sorting function that most people probably use because they‚Äôd probably rather painfully scroll left or right one at a time.

And you don‚Äôt allow us to turn the subscription off anywhere? Did you forget to put that in too? 

Bad decision after bad decision. 
Went from one of the only apps I used on this thing to now being one of my least favorite. You should put back a legacy version for people that don‚Äôt want to beta test your new experiments. Seriously how did this seem like a good idea?

1687,IKWeb,"May 13, 2021 at 4:00 PM",5,Great App - Why all the hate?,"So been using this app for a while. and it was great - then like everyone in the comments has said the update came along and the company has moved to a subscription model - like almost everything in this day and age. Keeping in mind with a subscription model this makes sure new content is added and the game (if you can call it that) gets updated and doesn't grow old. 

If people actually looked at what they were doing they would know they still get access to everything they did before the update after the update. I have all my DLC still and I can still use it as I did before. 

After 90 days I had the option to pay the ¬£7.99 per month if I wanted to get the latest content and new classes etc - Which I am more than happy to do myself. 

If I didn't then I could still use my old content. 

As a tech guy, I don't understand all the random comments around people going off on one due to the company moving to subs. 

You don't pay - you have access to what you did before. 

You pay - You get all the new features... 

It's not rocket science... But maybe for some, it is!

1692,DrM,"Apr 18, 2021 at 9:38 PM",1,Great exercise game,"Final update:
Ok, guess it auto updated :) That's another star.

Update:
Well it's down to 2 stars. Many things were improved upon since the sudden switch to FitXR, and I had my hopes up. But it's very obvious your main focus is making as much money as possible, and not fixing and fine tuning your existing app that people payed for.
I will try my best to not update to the new version with subscriptions, but I bet I will be forced to pretty soon. And I'm certain it will only be a downgrade, unless you subscribe.

Old:
I've tried the new FitXR a few times now, and I'm changing my review from 3 to 4 stars.
I didn't use BoxVR much in the last year or so. I just had too many issues, especially with out of sync music. There's still some sync problems, but at least now I'm able to adjust it by taking a step back or forward.
I see this as a fun exercise, and I don't care too much about streaks, points or the fake multiplayer.
Love the new graphics, but there should be a few different environments to choose from.
I ran into a few bugs with late explosions, and the game continuing on while the pause menu is still up. And it sucks that the game isn't fully playable offline.
But overall it's a great upgrade for me.
Looking forward to coming fixes and new features, like letting me add to favourites without having to play through the whole thing perhaps?

First review:
This version obviously have some audio sync issues, so I cant give it more than 3 stars.
Most of the time it's off just enough to be annoying, and a couple of times it got to the point where the orb was hitting my face to the beat of the music :)
I assume it will be fixed soon. And when it does, I'll come back and change my rating."

I am not sure why so many people are claiming that they were ripped off, or got involved in a bait and switch scam.  Sure, I paid for the app before it was free, but what I paid for still exists even if I don't decide to subscribe.  I bought DLC's for 9.99 each month that had a handful of exercise routines on them.  The OPTIONAL subscription is 9.99 per month.  Guess what?  If I choose not to subscribe, I will still have all of the content that I paid for.  If I choose to subscribe, I get new workouts everyday.

Burned thousands of calories and getting the hang of doing 20 minute intense sessions with getting explosive streaks of 500. However, with the new update this new ""advanced"" session actually beat me. I've tried different ones but seems like I'm not superhuman enough. It's so fast I don't know how anyone can react to split-second movements while dodging. 

Not whining that it's too hard just saying the movements are unrealistic. I spent more time concentrating on the targets than listening and getting the rhythm. I don't even remember the music I was boxing too. I love a challenge but advanced made me feel defeated. Maybe it's just me but it was the first time in 3 months I got folded bad. My heavy punches aren't being detected as well as it used to either. 

In conclusion, it's 30$ well spent and the music is great and catchy (I recommend The Winner track for beginners). If you want a great sweat while jamming go ahead. Stay away from the advanced tracks unless your professional boxer or can stop time somehow ü§£. I challenge the devs to post a video of them doing a 15-minute advanced course without stopping üòÇ."

Even though not all updates they bring out are well received, the developers are constantly working on bettering the game and adding new workouts. As well as being active in addressing questions by the community.

That being said, they aren't shy about changing large parts of their UI, game or monetisation system. But when it comes down to the purpose of the app, motivating and helping people to work out, they really seem to know what they're doing and how to do it effectively.

1699,RandomSadGamer,"May 20, 2021 at 1:37 AM",3,Fun but limited features,"Let me start by saying that I really enjoy the game. I downloaded it after it switched to a subscription model so I can't relate to the butthurt people who gave it 1 star just because of that. I'll review the game for what it is now.

It's a good workout. The game is fun and it makes working out less of a pain. The programs and the music are diverse enough so that you won't get easily bored and it'll push you to get exercise more often.

HOWEVER, in its current state, it's just not worth the monthly fee. Let me explain why:

1. The game offers no training or assistance for first time users or people who aren't fitness experts: there's no warm ups, no cool downs, not even a video to teach you the proper form while boxing.

2. The UI is atrocious: I get it that you guys paid a professional photographer and are fond of those photos of yourselves, but the truth is that nobody cares. The UI should be more informative. All we got now is the name of the program in small letters and the estimated calorie consumption, all accompanied by a huge freaking photo of one of the instructors. Maybe show something more useful like a short description of the workout, if it's focused on the upper or lower body, its popularity and whatnot.

3. Filters are buried under a couple menus: filters should be THE MOST PROMINENT feature of the UI. They should be RIGHT THERE when you launch the game so you can choose the workout that suits you best.

4. No data tracking: it would be great if the game gathered data from your performance and fitness level to recommend the workouts that are best for you. Also, the calorie count is way off. Take a look at Freeletics to see how to collect user data properly.

5. Only 3 environments: well, just two actually, but on the second one you can choose either daytime ot night time.

Again, I enjoy the game well enough, but it's not worth its monthly fee in its current state. I will support the game for now because I want to see it grow, but it needs some serious improvements overall."
1700,Lord Blakeney,"May 10, 2021 at 9:00 AM",3,"Was great, now a complete joke","I first installed before their ‚Äúupdate‚Äù. Now its a complete joke.

Edit 5/9: Filters have been re-added. I‚Äôve upped my review from 1 stars to 3. App could get a fourth by improving tracking and making finding/saving workouts more intuitive. Apps that make you pay $30 full price then bait/switch to a monthly fee model DONT get a fifth star."

I can't complain about the subscription  at all because I get the 3 months free which is what I would have paid for the software anyways. I also completely understand the subscription . This type of game needs regular changes and updates and new workouts which is time consuming and time costs money.

The multiplayer is a game changer  for me. It is so much more motivating playing with family and friends being able to talk and compete with each other.  It adds a whole new level of motivation .

The ui is much more modern and aesthetically pleasing and is super simple to use .

Best workout app I have tried to date hands down. This could completely substitute a gym membership for some people which costs a lot more than the subscription. I don't know of any weight loss or exercise business that is only $9 a month . Don't complain about the subscription and just use it as motivation to push your limits every month to get the most out of your $9 ."
1703,VrJohhny,"Apr 16, 2021 at 2:15 PM",1,Are you kidding me? Subscription?,"I paid 30 Euros for this, and now its free and i need a subscription? Oh man the greed is big with this one. Thanks for nothing and for not communicating with your costumers. I cant even refund the 30 Euros, because 14 days are gone. Boxing is motivating, but there is too little to do for 30 euros. There are hardly any intense workouts. Some are good, but after two or three playthroughs they are extremely boring and no longer motivating. The music isn't motivating either. Would be much better if I could add my own songs. Then there is no warming up and cooling down / stretching. I also want to train longer. E.g. one hour without a break. Squats are built in, but too little is asked of you. Yes, I can bend down a little, but sometimes dodging sideways, like with Beats., but how the walls are solved there would be great here too. An option would also be great for any jump punches like in the movie Real Steel. Yes, I'm fantasizing here right now, but why not ?!
Maybe you could add an option for kicking too, even if you can't necessarily track it. There are so many options, but I see so little implemented. All in all, would definitely not recommend it. There's just not enough for the money."
1704,Robert,"Apr 22, 2021 at 1:58 PM",5,Love the app,"So, let‚Äôs not talk about the update. And the huge communication fail with that. Luckily the support team was quick in resolving issues. 

But in general this is an amazing app. Logged almost 18 hours of using it in the first month or so. 

I would definitely recommend it!

Note to FitXR: how about bringing back the filters for courses. I‚Äôm missing the time and level filters a lot in searching for a course."
1705,BABVA,"May 11, 2021 at 12:00 AM",2,"Changed overnight, for the worse.","I had found a game that helped me exercise and each time I played I felt it. I saved some sessions into my favourites and now after the update those favourites are in a subscription model. Even the free to play menu feels like you're not welcome, you cant separate dance vs boxing, probably cause it will show how little you get. Maybe a mail shot to users to let them know, would have caused a dlc purchase surge as you get to keep it apparently. I paid full price for this and now feel really let down. If you want to pay ¬£7.99 per month then yer it is good for what it is but that also gives you others to compare against now.

Game was updated since the above and it added more negatives, most games start with muted music and I have to quit out to reset it. You're told the same tip each game start about setting a background and when you go to do it your told they are locked, still can't filter the game choices. Daily workouts are boring. The Facebook community is mixed and sadly growing toxic."

1707,Wendles,"Jun 1, 2021 at 11:02 AM",4,Good for a work out,"I am a senior & pensioner, so yes I'm concerned about the subscription particularly here in Australia as I expect it will be more expensive. I do enjoy the boxing, have also had some fun with Hiit. I do not get the dance classes.  I love dancing! but I can't find a beginner class or warmup to get the hang of it. Intermediate as a starting point is too fast! Fortunately I am a previous owner, so should be able to take advantage of the boxing at least. Would be  happier if you could pay for what you used. I couldn't afford $120 for a gym membership every year, so I certainly couldn't justify it on VR. However I would be happy to  pay an extra one off fee for the  Hiit component similar to the DLC pks. I believe paying a one-off fee for each of  the components you can use would be fair for original owners even if it cost the same as the original app.
I personally believe the higher star rating is fair for the app itself, but the cost is a let down. I don't expect to get anything for nothing, we all have to make a living, just hope the developers can work out a fairer way to deal with this particularly for previous owner/supporters."
1708,Ray,"May 30, 2021 at 8:05 PM",4,Great boxing workout!,"As a former boxer I feel this was a very good workout.  I can compare the boxing to punch mitt practice.  It‚Äôs expensive to get one on one training with a coach and FitXR provides a similar workout.  What I don‚Äôt like is it seems to reward improper technique with straight punches where it allows for a hammer fist down instead.  I couldn‚Äôt figure out how people were getting much higher points then I was until I realize from their avatars that some players were doing that.  The new HIIT training has been great so far.  It makes me sweat a lot in just a short period of time.  This is the one game that actually gives me a good leg workout and not just the arms.  One problem with HIIT is that if I move too fast with squats and side to side movement it loses track of my location and pauses the game.   I wish there was a way around it, don‚Äôt know if it is a limitation of the oculus headset."
1709,K3nn3H,"Feb 17, 2021 at 3:58 PM",3,Are you kidding me 6 addons WTF !,"I thought i'd give this a go and to be honest  its not a bad workout but why include the dancing ,yeah most of us like to dance but only having head and hand tracking its quite pointless of what i've seen of it .Now the boxing part is quite good bobbing crouch punching i quite like bit of this fitness game .I see there's now 6 addons for this which i think is taking the p*$$ if you ask me as with the game totals over 70 quid which is way over priced and talk about  milking it .

The music tracks are dire and not many of them unless you purchase more which is a joke unlike say beat saber which has loads of tracks to choose from more to purchase if you wish and allows you to listen to your own music .

Also loading times can take ages to get the fitness part working ,it even froze to which i had to quite the game and restart it only for it to take ages again to start fitness part to which i quite the game again .

¬£22.99 for this purchase only to charge more for all the content making it over ¬£70 is not good .

Things is dev's seem to leave content out of a purchase only so they can charge extra for it at a later date .If your going to charge so much for extra content then make the item alot cheaper or free then charge for extra content not both as thats  bad practice  which annoys us customers ."

The navigation menu is quite poor. After the upgrade it looks nicer but in reality it feels worse. The search functionality does not work. It would be better to select a few categories and have results returned. E.g. Boxing, Intermediate, upto 15 min.

Still a 5 star review because of its awesomeness."
1712,Mitch,"Apr 22, 2021 at 12:20 AM",5,Best fitness VP app out there!,"I love FitXR! Has to be the best fitness VR app on Oculus right now.  

This thing kept me sane during lockdown, especially when it was too cold or dark to get out and exercise. Although even with the weather improving I think I am hooked for good!  Being able to easily and quickly fit a 20min high intensity boxing class into any part of my day is a great addition to the daily routine.  Pretty pumped about the new update too - yes it is now on a subscription basis but that doesn't bother me as I am not sure I will go back to my old monthly membership at the gym now I have FitXR.  Plus the new content, the new music and the fact I can finally workout with mates is exactly what this thing needed! Why would I complain about new and more regular content...

This was the best fitness VR app on Oculus before the big update and in my view this update has made it even better."
1713,Quest,"May 6, 2021 at 7:53 PM",5,Fun workout. *Subscription needed if new,"This game is great! The workouts are well balanced, challenging, and fun. And the devs actively update it to make it the best experience possible.

A lot of folks are tripping about the subscription but it seems like the core game is still there. I'll update in 90 days to see if all is still good with this game. 

They actually improved the UI and improved the filler/sorting system where you can select multiple difficulty levels.

One small suggestion is that when you favorite a workout, a white star appears to indicate that it's been marked as a favorite. The problem is some backdrops are white, so it's difficult to see if you've already marked that workout as a favorite or not. Fortunately, you can easily toggle the favorite button a few times and be able to tell that way if you stare hard to spot a difference lol. It's not a huge deal though. 

I'm glad they fixed the filtering system though! That was a huge letdown at first.

Enjoy this game and its workouts! Although I dont think I'll do the subscription because I'm cool with the core game's offerings, the core selection of workouts alone is well worth the money!

EDIT: Well it seems that the subscription is actually required for those new to FitXR (those who didn't buy it before it turned into a subscription only model). I still think the game for its core gameplay - a great well-balanced workouts with squats and side lunges to the beat of nice music - is worth 5 stars. And fortunately for me, I won't have to buy the subscription and still have the game I paid for some time ago. However, for those uninterested in a subscription model but would still enjoy the game, this update is quite unfortunate."
1714,Kristina,"Apr 27, 2021 at 8:22 PM",5,Don‚Äôt Believe the Haters!,"If you want a good workout to elevate your heart rate I highly suggest this one! They made changes recently and you KNOW those people who hate change are griping. 

The things I love about the game:  It gets my HR up higher than any other workout app so far;  squats can be turned off but I like them to add a lower body workout;  punching the orbs is such a great stress reliever for me; and no matter how many orbs you miss you don‚Äôt ‚Äúdie‚Äù and the workout continues to the end. 

The music is generic but it‚Äôs fine to punch along to.  It takes a little practice to get used to the best way to hold the controllers so your ‚Äúpower streak‚Äù will climb and up your score.  But I personally don‚Äôt care so much about the score as I do my heart rate. Whether or not I get a score for hitting it regular or with force doesn‚Äôt matter to me. 

If you are looking for a workout that makes you sweat and builds your strength I think you‚Äôll like this one!"

1716,Josa,"Apr 19, 2021 at 8:46 PM",2,Expensive,"FitXR would be one of my favorite apps, but with USD 10 on a monthly plan, you are targeting people that want to replace their regular workout routine. Not me, I just want to play it for fun... and for that reason, way too expensive. My friends share the opinion and will not subscribe, hence, the multiplayer option is useless too...

We want games that we pay for once and then have fun playing. Subscription based plans on Oculus destroy the spirit."

1718,The PrimeVariable,"Apr 17, 2021 at 1:43 AM",2,Need to listen to your fans,"As a leader of the XR space in the Asia Pacific region and a long time digital marketer, there is one thing you need to do better.

Listen.

Like everyone else who recently let you know it's not cool to charge a full priced ticket to an attraction, then ask them to pay more to actually see it, that is a straight up scam and you're being called out for it.

We who payed full price were giving you a chance when nobody else would. And your reward to us is to limit our experience and ask us to pay more for what sounds like a less enjoyable experience.

Multi-player is great, if the content and lead up to select the right experience makes sense. Limiting how to filter by level and type is a backwards step friends. And yes we can all play together for free, on the limited version. However we can't invite friends to join the full experience if they haven't paid. 

Suggestion: give those of us who paid the full price an unlimited access account. Then give us a limited code to share to friends to get a discount on a bundle subscription, say 6 months. Let us get hooked and get our friends hooked and by then you'll have sorted all the bugs out and gotten your fan base back up. 

Otherwise, well, it's unhappy campers for a long time."

The other thing I find usually when I get tired at something I stop :/.  The punches keep coming at you and you don‚Äôt want to see yourself drop down the leaderboard so it gets you motivated to keep going !!  Also,  seeing your streak rise is exciting and you see yourself improving!

1722,Arakon,"Apr 28, 2021 at 9:28 AM",4,Good workout,"This game will really make you sweat.
For the people reporting tracking issues: Be aware that those are not tracking issues usually, but timing issues. The timing of the game is different to what most people are used to. It's critical that your hand is still moving when impacting the orb.. just touching it will not count as a hit. Due to the fact that you need to actually swing to score, you have to start the swing early so you hit the orb in time when it arrives while you are still in full swing. For the basic round orbs, it helps to punch with the knuckles facing upwards. To block, you don't need to cover your face. Just face the backs of your hands forwards, and lift them slightly up.

Once you get the timing down, it's quite doable to get a 100% hit ratio on a song."
1723,Hngodesign,"Apr 25, 2021 at 10:58 PM",3,I see why this new update upset users,"I see why the update upset a lot of users. I think the UI looks cleaner but the UX is definitely not as good as before. Here are the mistakes you guys made.

1. Let people opt in to the subscription based service. Don't assume people want it even if the first 90 days is free. It's not clear what the subscription offering is and why it's worth it. You should let people opt in so it's clear what other features you get.

2. Too many big changes upsets an experience users were used to. That fact you completely changed the visuals, navigation, and the offering really confused me. It's not clear what is the base game I PAID FOR and what comes with the subscription. It's a lot for the user to comprehend and figure out.

3. Lack filtering and sorting. So the game allows you to filter by class type and instructor, but when you apply it, it actually doesn't truly filter. If I select box, I still see dance classes because they are trying to promote new classes. It comes across as the filters not working properly. You also need to bring back more filters like music, time, etc and be able to sort.

4. Your favorites is cluttered with other classes they are trying to push/recommend. It's annoying and doesn't belong there. There should be a NEW section if I want to see new classes. Favorites should just be classes I saved as a favorite. That's it. Favorites should be in the main navigation vs under my profile. I get why it's there, bit it seems too far from the main navigation list and not quite as intuitive to find.

5. Needs more info in the class cards. Besides looking at the big center card, I can't easily tell which class is box vs dance. You need a label or color coat to clearly communication which class type it is since the ""filters"" does not truly filter based off class type.

The core gameplay is still the same which is good, but your team could have handled this transition much smoother. You should have done more user testing and research before pushing this update to make sure it didn't effect the customer experience. It's too late now, but I hope your team learned from this mishap. You broke a lot of trust which is the most important part i feel like.

If you all want feedback, I'm happy to help before pushing major changes like this."
1724,dvrectenup,"Apr 25, 2021 at 2:35 PM",2,New update getting game worse,"Okay, what I'm need to paying for? I don't need multiplayer features. I just want play to my favorite box classes with clear class sorting feature and buy some new songs, when I bored in current classes how it was before. I have allready paid 40 bucks (30 for game and 10 for rock pack (wich sucks by the way ‚Äî all tracks are weak and boring)), and I don't want paing 10 bucks every month for things wich I don't use and wich broken. What happened with class sorting feature? It's blow my mind. How you can do it SO bad? It's don't update ‚Äî it's downgrade! And 10 bucks? C'mon. I'm paying for some content streaming service like netflix less and get for thousand times more content. What I get here for 10 bucks? Just explain.

It's full of bugs and glitches now:
- sometimes sound just dessapear
- it's just glitch when you strat the game
- sometimess pause DON'T STOP THE GAME and you just fail your streak
- controller tracking is suck. When you move your hand close to jaw (what you NEED to do in REAL boxing basic stance), game lose controller (in another boxing game (TRILL to the FIGHT or Boxing Coach for example) it doesn't happens.
- when you start the class at the moment when you are sitting and trying to restore breathe, for example, game think that your sitting height is acctualy height and when you stands up, all cues will be appearing somewhere around the floor. 
- You can't add some workout equipment. Even official. If you use wrist band, or weight vest ‚Äî you burning more calories, but it is not taken into account."

1731,cityfaefolk,"Apr 4, 2021 at 5:59 PM",5,Good workout game with potential,"FixXR Review (April 2021)

TLDR - I‚Äôm happy with the update and I would pay the $30 just for the boxing part. Good workout and I love it even more on a wireless VR headset.

I‚Äôll try to keep this short‚ÄîI love BoxVR and I don‚Äôt like change. But I‚Äôm away from home and my power pc and I needed to let off some steam, so I bought FixXR and tried it out on a friend‚Äôs quest 2 headset.

Interface/environments - so much less buggy than BoxVR. Still haven‚Äôt played too much with it but I liked what I saw. Glad to see there are now two environments to choose from. I do miss the old nighttime gym option but not a deal breaker. I like that you can see the intensity of the workout. Sometimes in BoxBR you‚Äôd be all geared up for a tough workout and it would give you a softy one.

Songs - I was glad to find that songs from BoxVR are still available on FitXR.  I have my favorites from BoxVR and I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt have them on FitXR.  Some people don‚Äôt like the lack of popular music but I‚Äôve grown to love it and hearing familiar tracks gets me motivated.

You can disable the trainer voiceover feedback - I may turn this on eventually, but I prefer to exercise alone and set my own pace.  Also like that the solo mode option.

You can disable squats - I hurt my back and had to put down BoxVR for a while because of the squats. Glad I can play with this option as I build my strength back up.

You can change how the game tracks streaks - You can choose from power punches or just hitting the targets. I agree with all the other feedback from others that the power streak mode is really tough! I found myself manipulating my jabs to activate power hits instead of focusing on the workout or good form. Still needs some work I think.

Dance exercise - no idea, haven‚Äôt tried it and I probably won‚Äôt ever try it."

1736,Gandhi,"Apr 21, 2021 at 9:07 PM",5,Very good thoughts on improvements,"I've been using this app since September 2020, its taken a little while to get used to it. Coming from a zero exercise background I found it difficult at first, especially getting a explosive streaks.

I use this app everyday and I'm loving it!

Areas that need improvement:

- better tuition

I don't know how to throw a punch, fact.  This app doesn't tell you how to do it safely. I hurt myself initially because of the lack of tuition (especially when trying to get that streak. I had to research it myself (pull your punches!)

- difficulty/intensity rating system

light/Moderate/Intense 

I strongly believe these do not accurately reflect the work out sessions. I have used Light sessions that have been so difficult I had to stop and avoided Intense sessions only to eventually play them and find they essentially a Light session.

Other the aforementioned improvements I would like to see. I really like this app and the encouragement the trainer's and the stats give me to improve myself

Hi FitXR team,

i love this app but.....

the previous interface, was ok it had problems.

but the new interface WOWEE, does it have problems.

1. Wasted screen real estate, so much space is wasted on unimportant/uninformative pictures. Information to consider in order of importance:
- 1: class name
- 2: class difficulty
- 3: class duration
- 4: class calories
- 5: the picture of the instructor (which mean absolutely nothing to me, they all look the same, which makes it very hard to identify anything!!!)

2. ""clicking"" through to find my favourite/any classes takes sooooo long its insane!! the currently layout only displays 5 classes at a time. could we not have the option to LIST the classes and get rid of the image of the instructor? especially is you an experienced player.

3. having to click everything with the trigger, this is such a slow process AND to make it worst the clickable box is tiny, so its very hard click. Thumb sticks, we have 2 available, please can we use them for navigation?

4. when you move from one screen to another your progress through the class selection screen resets!!! i dont wanna click through 50 pages of classes i do not wanna do!!!

unfortunately all of these issues scream bad design, people like my self wanna just finish work and get on with there work out, not spend aaaages look through pages and pages to find what they want. it tedious.

5. favourites appear to be broken, i have classes listed that i have done. also i dont wanna see ""classes of the day"" in my favourites, it it not my favourite.

6. the ""stats"" section got some improvements, i like that i can seem stats for each class i have done recently. BUT its broken in place with missing class titles. AND my biggest annoyance is that the time spent has change from 12h7min format to just minutes, can we have an option to change to display different time formats?

7. ????????? what are all the questions marks, it like they placeholders for missing images.

i really really like this app, but hate how long it take me to find the classes i wanna do.

and if i'm honest the look and feel isnt as nice a previous interface, the previous one felt... right... like i was going to the gym, like walking into the gym.....now its sort of just nothing.

ps i'm looking forward to the HIIT studio"

After just trying the free short boxing classes available I was pouring with sweat and today I have aches in muscles I didn't know existed. I've done a lot of weight training in my life but never have I felt so well worked out as I do now.

You don't even realise how hard you are working until it comes time to remove the headset and you're soaking. The dance classes aren't really my thing so I don't really have any interest in those.

I did try Thrill Of The Fight but it irritated an old ACL injury in my knee from all the twisting and weaving involved. The boxing on FitXR is pretty much stationary for your legs so it is perfect for me. Use Pistol Whip as a warmup then FitXR for my main workout and I love it.

I will be signing up to the subscription for the VERY reasonable ¬£7.99 a month, later today.

Thankyou to the developers. I see from the comments that you've had a lot of hate over the last few months but not from me! You've done an awesome job."

They do squats,  but not enough for my liking. I don't opt for the dance workouts, just the punching and squatting (just personal preference.) Hopefully a good leg/squat pack is in the horizon.

1744,Jwops,"Apr 20, 2021 at 5:30 PM",5,Boxing newbie,"I have had FitXr for about 3 weeks now. I waited to review until I had a better handle on the game. As someone who enjoys dance games, but had never taken a boxing class in my life, I wasn‚Äôt sure how I‚Äôd go. First class, I absolutely struggled through it, but then as I went on, aching arms and all, I then got what I‚Äôd describe as a runners high, and just got super amped up and just didn‚Äôt want to stop. I really didn‚Äôt  expect this and I am so stoked to have a fitness game that I actually look forward to getting to each day. Now with the update. I had prior to this update read of other fitness apps that did subscriptions, and thought why would I do that when I can do this. But now that this is subscription and I‚Äôve realised the benefit of the game and what the additions will bring me, I am definitely a convert, and now can‚Äôt imagine not having this in my fitness regime. I am really looking forward to seeing the capabilities of this and glad to be along for the ride. 
For anyone new, I‚Äôd definitely suggest watching their warm up stretches and form videos on their Instagram or Facebook too."
1745,Meishseeks,"May 27, 2021 at 1:46 AM",4,Absolutely love ‚ù§Ô∏è!!,"FITVR has been my daily driver for working out since I got my motivation back to work out after being stuck in the house and away from the gym for over a year the weight had come on so I really need to get off my couch stop eating the lady gaga Oreos and move a little , I don‚Äôt trust going back to gym so fitvr has kept me active and also motivated , it‚Äôs so quick and easy to put on my quest and do a work out & the addition of the HIIT studio just makes this better and better it‚Äôs fun and challenging and has really been pushing me out of my comfort zone , the only thing I would say is the orbs on HIIT  are a bit close so sometimes I‚Äôm missing where the orbs appear  but maybe that‚Äôs to do with my space and guardian rather than the game it‚Äôs self ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, also I was of the understanding that when the purple orbs appear that you can punch with any hand but points are being taken off so not sure if I‚Äôm doing it right or not . These are my only bad points . I cannot wait to see what‚Äôs to come in the future‚Ä¶. Top marks from me"
1746,str8y,"May 4, 2021 at 10:56 PM",2,Severe timing problems,After the update some songs have severe timing issues. I would consider that for a rhythm game as essential. It‚Äòs not much fun when you have to force you to punch out of rhythm :(

It makes me crazy even when I got them dibble as hard as the side or up punch i still get around 5 .....
Hopefully there can be a improvement in this.
Update 16-04-2021
Tried the update but lots missed punches wile I'm 100% shure I hit them and most times I even see mi hand going thru the block but I missed anyway. Verry frustrating and the reason that I will stop playing. Please fix this a.s.a.p
Update 23-5-2021
Still the same problems on hard I'm missing Les then in easy. So frustrating because I'm hitting them 100% and they are counted as a mis.... :-s
Also become I could set the default play aria to outside because I really don't like inside but now every game I need to set it again to outside.

P.s. maybe you can make a tutorial on hou to het the balls the right way! Maybe this will help. (I know hou to punch but maybe the game is programs differently)

Please do something about these problems!"

1750,Chris H,"Mar 24, 2021 at 7:30 PM",5,"Not perfect, but best fitness for me","I'll start off by saying I only use boxing. Tried ""easy"" dancing once and didn't make 2 minutes. I agree with other reviewers that the music is not great, but as someone who left Supernatural because of the high cost, I imagine licensing popular music is pretty expensive. I'd rather have the low cost and for me, the music is just something to keep the workout more interesting. I could just as easily turn it off and play my own background music. I find the competitive option very motivating. I would love more analysis available post workout. More ""instructor"" feedback would be great - ""100 hit streak, you're moving up, you're moving down"". I'm also not a fan of the streak. It's very frustrating to hit 99% of the targets well, but because the 5 you miss are spread out, the streaks don't do well. I hope it will evolve over time, but it's my go to arms fitness workout for now (use VZFit Games on a stationary bike for legs)."

1756,Jeremy,"Apr 16, 2021 at 4:43 PM",4,"Despite the update, I‚Äôm a fan","I had purchased the game a couple months ago and then requested a refund immediately. I wasn‚Äôt enjoying the leaderboards because it was causing me to lose enjoyment while playing. I was hoping for a way to play solo without worrying about competing against others. 

After seeing there was an update, I decided to try it out again. Yes, there is no filter anymore in the new Home Screen which is a bummer. Hopefully the devs can work on bringing that back. 
My situation is different from all these other one star reviews because I‚Äôm basically trying the app out from scratch again because I got my initial $30 back a while ago. 

I do have to say I really enjoy the app now. I love that I don‚Äôt have to compete against others. I had a great couple of work outs and overall had a good time with the app.

I just thought I would add a fresh perspective amongst all these negative reviews."
1757,Eric Laughton,"Apr 21, 2021 at 10:33 PM",5,"Outstanding update, but...","First, spending $10 a month to ensure my fitness is a small price to pay in my opinion. I do very much enjoy the additional content and HIIT is going to rock!Ôøº

1759,Robin,"Apr 16, 2021 at 3:12 PM",1,Paid full price - unable to box,"I bought fitvr yesterday (¬£21) and fired it up for the first time today

Apparently I have landed in amongst a big change to a subscription model.

It walked me through a tutorial and I thought my headset had broken. Nope. They‚Äôve just disabled changing the volume on the headset, you have to use the menu, which is a real pain when you‚Äôre mid exercise


The routine was a fun punching game, and I looked forward to more of it.

BUT WAIT! NO BOXING UNLESS YOU PAY MORE!

I had a small number (4 or 5?) of dance workouts available to me and everything else was locked behind a paywall.

Utter con job.


A real shame, I‚Äôd have shelled out for DLC but charging so much for so little?

No chance. Refund requested. There‚Äôs other options for VR fitness."
1760,Noxerr,"Mar 26, 2021 at 10:15 PM",5,"really cool, original modes","i  bought it to play during quarantine with my girlfriend so we both would do some cardio. It really helped to stay active but then after everything went back to normal we started working out at home with bands and so on. Today i was missing the trainings in fitXR and the graphics are changed, I liked them quite a lot. I also discovered the new dancing mode, kind of hard to follow i guess there should be a beginner mode with some more hints on what to do or something.. because I'm really clumsy following the teacher. All in all, a great game, i'd buy it again"
1761,Vince,"May 27, 2021 at 10:47 PM",4,App no longer crashes,"Updated my review based on quick response from the developer. Game was crashing all the time but recommendation to delete and re install resolved the issue.   Not crazy about all the recent changes, but still get a good workout and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important to me."
1762,CASSAUNDRA,"May 17, 2021 at 2:34 AM",4,A great workout,After sitting on the couch for almost a year of the Covid Pandemic this app got me up and moving! It is surprisingly a GREAT workout. Even the beginner modes are a challenge. I love that they release a new workout each day that I can try. Also I love the filtering of the different workouts. I can play with friends which I love. The only thing I wish was there is if we could have re-occuring codes or team/room codes for people who workout daily together. Or the option to join OPEN multiplayer sessions. So far you can only join sessions if you know a code. You can workout with other people's previous workout (not live) which I do like because it pushes me to beat their scores.

Who knows in the next year may be up to trying dance!

1769,Lycos,"Mar 23, 2021 at 2:56 PM",5,Most fun way I've found to sweat!,"Love it! I got BoxVR 'back-in-the-day' on the Rift and never knew I would drive my heart and sweat rates so high hitting silly coloured balloons straight, sideways or up. Always need a shower afterward, and hold this around 40% responsible for a 40 lb weight loss.
Yes, sometimes it can be frustrating if you swear you did hit correctly and hard enough but it doesn't register and you lose a streak and your top spot but hey - that's sport! Sometimes the umpire/ref gets the call wrong and we have to suck it up. And it's likely just the tech still learning. (I notice glitches happen more or less depending on the lighting I'm playing under.)
I loved the old BoxVR thing of being able to add your own music. It wasn't as rhythmic or as varied but was great to make your own playlist. (Can that be added back? Probably not... now there is DLC. Nope, I'm not bitter about DLC for $, no $20 monthly sub like the 'other' VR fitness app - I'm with you guys.)
Still, even though I sound all nostalgic for some BoxVR features I'm giving this 5/5; great workout, zero motion sickness, no monthly sub, fun to compete with strangers without interacting with them, varied playlists and tempos... a great use of VR."
1770,Ben Lea,"May 3, 2021 at 11:09 PM",4,Great game but costly on subscription,"I really enjoy this game and it's the only one I actually use if I'm being honest. Fortunately I purchased the game before the subscription fee came in, so I will be reverting back to this unless the subscription fee reduces. It's still a great game with the subscription but it's just too expensive given how limited the fitness regime is. 

One downfall I've found is that if you are relatively fit, there are a limited number of advanced classes available and at present you can't separate these when searching for a class. There are lots of beginner/intermediate classes but they just don't cut it for me even if I was to do a very long workout.

Overall it's a great fitness game and one I'd promote if you have very young children like myself as it makes you want to exercise and is easily accessible but it is limited at present as the main bulk of the classes focus on your arms/chest with some but a limited focus on legs through ducking."
1771,Panat,"Apr 12, 2021 at 7:55 PM",5,Very good game and very fast support.,I purchased BoxVR extension last month and used it twice. Now I got updated to FitXR and I lost that extension (extreme pack). I then contacted a support team and they fix the issue very fast.

Have heard good things about this game, but the experience I got when I tried it was relaly disappointing"
1776,mamplin,"Apr 16, 2021 at 1:02 AM",2,WAS ! An absolute must for fitness fans,"UPDATE.
Can‚Äôt believe this app has gone subscription.  Downgraded my review as they should have left this app as is and just launched a Fitxr2 with subscription for those who want to go down that route !!   I appreciate we keep our content , but the menus , previous purchases is hard to find and navigate .  The filters are now awful and you‚Äôve upset a massive community .  Gutted !!! 

Review below before the awful awful update ! 

I‚Äôve had Fitxr for three weeks now and have so far lost 5kg doing boxing and dance classes 5 days a week for 45mins a day.  Suitable for all levels of fitness , great fun workouts even got my wife and kids working out daily with it too .  Great music , fun workouts , wish I‚Äôd bought it sooner ."
1777,Ryan,"Apr 16, 2021 at 10:49 PM",1,Game kills volume buttons and headphones,"Not sure how they did it, but this is the only experience I know of that felt the need to completely kill headphone use as well as the physical volume buttons on the device.

Devs... the volume rockers should control the master volume setting in game, with the other two settings being adjustable as desired."
1778,Frankensteinfood,"Dec 22, 2020 at 10:26 PM",4,Good not Great,"I was super skeptical when purchasing this game as I was a USA Boxing Instructor and thought how gimmicky it could be.  The game is really good, but does lack some fluidity and rhythm.   Some of the sessions are near perfect, but a lot of them are very simple and easily put together with no thought to ""on rhythm"" hits.  Another way to put it is, the hits are not to the rhythm of most of the songs.  The producer should have played the games before approving them.  I am also a video editor and know how easy this is, but this design team missed the mark big time.  I still enjoy my ""VRKouts"" every morning and so grateful to have a product such as this in these times.  If you are looking to lose weight, grab this now....it does work.  One more thing...they could use WAY more heavy rock music!"
1779,Charlee,"Apr 19, 2021 at 3:58 AM",3,Subscriptions Suck,"This is a subscription service now, so beware, you pay for the game and then by month.  The fee is $9.99 a month.  While the game is fun, I have my doubts if it will be worth the subscription fee!  Time will tell... 3 stars only because it‚Äôs a subscription after you pay for the game..."
1780,Lisandra,"May 4, 2021 at 2:03 AM",4,Great update,"I liked the changes you guys did. The idea of playing with someone else besides a bot is great. I feel it is something that needed to be added. I was already tired of the same soundtracks which to a point didn't encourage me to play the game. Thank you for this initiative of adding new games from time to time. 

Something that I hate about this update is that I can't search for the games like we used to do before. I liked how I could filter beginner, intermediate and advanced (thank you for adding expert). Now even when I search for those words it is not easy to find the games. This is a turn down because I am playing against a beginner and I have to search for them one by one it is time-consuming. 

I feel something that would encourage me. Is having the trainer in front of us like you could see it with the dancing game. I would feel like they could also do it..."
1781,wojciech.brygola,"May 11, 2021 at 12:10 AM",4,A little bit disappointed,"I bought app in January, yesterday opened it for the very first time, just to find out that there is barely any content. Which is disappointing, given I paid for application, I would expect at least some hours of fun, not minutes.

Also, I do miss stuff like campaign/some kind of achievement system. Overally app feels more like early stage than a well refined well thought product (which I would happily subscribe to, but there is nothing to drag me into subscription really, give me something to drag me into)

EDIT: support helped, I got 3month free subscription and/or some content which I was supposed to get automatically. Still, I'm pretty sure whenever competition is gonna appear, they gonna eat FitXR for breakfast - I tried one which at the moment is available only in US and its seriously cooler/better in variety of aspects."
1782,Sano,"Mar 30, 2021 at 12:57 AM",5,Update. Works well,"Bought this game for my daughter and it doesn't work. All of the text and buttons look like its code instead of actual words.

1783,Withinthsgravity,"Mar 23, 2021 at 2:42 PM",5,Great workout! Favorite VR app,"Love, love, love FitXR.  Great workout, and for me, doesn‚Äôt feel like a typical mundane workout.  I really break a giant sweat when boxing via FitXR.  

The boxing classes are my favorite, but the dance classes are fun too.  In addition to doing 45 minutes of boxing classes in FitXR, I do 90 mins of walk/run intervals on the treadmill, lift weights, and a few sit-up reps, etc. all from home. FitXR is the only workout that doesn‚Äôt feel like the stereotypical workout (a huge plus for me).  Really fun classes and something I want to do as often as possible. 

The improvements I would make:

1). New content added more frequently;

2). Moving the class timer more in line with our eye view during the boxing classes (and perhaps even doing this with the class roster too).   I have difficulty looking to the right or left to view these items, without missing or messing up my rhythm.  

Please keep up the great work.  This is my absolute favorite VR app. ü•≥üî•"

I‚Äôm excited to see what effect subscriptions will have on the game. I‚Äôm extremely happy so far. I get the kind of workout that I would get from a class at a gym.

Usually do 20 minutes about 4-5 times a week. I don‚Äôt do the dance feature at all. Tried a class, but couldn‚Äôt get into it. If you‚Äôre looking for a VR boxing workout, this is absolutely it.

For me Fitxr stays great and I really like the new plethora of extra workouts and music.
Worth the monthly fee for me considering the large amount of new content (at home 2 people use fitxr).

Being unable to select workouts based on difficulty level and in an overview grid is really annoying and has to be fixed asap. When this is fixed an easy 5 star rating!"

Need to be able to see session results at end, return ability to adjust gloves, create playlists, have more than one venue (at least a lighter area), lower the effects when hits are made and lastly and most important, have the streaks based on hits and not the power hits. Maybe have two streaks.  Update-12/28/20. Fixed most of my issues. Can now adjust your gloves, added new venue and can change the hit streak function. Just wish they would add the playlist function back. Update 04/16/21. What a ripoff now. Paid for the game and 2 expansion packs and now can‚Äôt access any of my purchases .

1795,Alex,"Apr 25, 2021 at 3:49 PM",4,A fair not angry Re-Review,"So this has changed... alot. 

Elephant in the room this has a subscription now. I'm okay with this. I like the new music they've added in and how they've upped the intensity of the advanced workouts and added variation with the punches. ¬£7.99 is quite alot, but FitXR is my daily driver for exercise so it might be worth it for me. Wherever or not I sub depends on the hiit classes and how frequent the updates are. So far it's a... maybe, I really like the new classes. I still have everything I paid for since I've had this since BoxVR, so happy about that, I can just carry on as normal if I don't.

The good:
Great music, lots variety and classes

Extremely effective workouts where you really feel the burn. I burn about 700kcal an hour in advanced modes, with an average heart rate of 130-140. Compared to other rhythm games it's a more consistent workout and you can keep the pace up for longer than something like Thrill of the fight. Longer=better for weight loss and fitness, and this keeps my heart rate consistently high.

Shadow multiplayer classes/multiplayer, I really enjoy chasing the highscore when working out.

Presentation. The new menu screen is more polished and I like the design of it. It looks like they've polished the overall graphics as well.

The Bad:
I miss being able to sort my classes by length and intensity, there's something like 100 songs now and you have to scroll through every one to find something. Please add this in, especially as your adding in 30 new tracks a month!

Only 3 environments, please add more."

1802,timJ.collins,"Apr 19, 2021 at 3:01 AM",4,Love it,"This is a great workout. I haven't experienced any tracking issues at all... might just be how other hold their hands? About my only complaint and what holds it back from being 5 stars is the music - it's well chosen and all but does get repetitive by the second week. I'd love to see maybe music packs like beat saber has... definitely worth buying, though, because this will make you sweat.

Edit : I'm not a fan of the newest update. Tge classes are great but some days I don't want 16 minute high intensity workouts... it needs a filter to find length or intensity. Sorting through classes one by one isn't optimal at all.

That said it remains the best workout I've found on the quest yet... I am just not in love with the latest ui is all."

I've owned FitXR since before it was called FitXR. I had a serious injury to my right arm a few months ago - the entire arm up to the rotator cuff. It's too long a story to leave here but the short of it is that I was spared surgery because everything broke in place. The one stipulation was that if anything shifted or moved while healing within the first two months then I would need the surgery. So, I babied it - kept it in it's sling and became pretty much sedentary. My primary concern was getting past the healing period so that I wouldn't need the surgery - fortunately that day came and went. What I didn't realize was the amount of damage to muscle and tendons and then from staying in one position for that long. Once cleared I started physical therapy to regain mobility but the muscles were weak (expected given the damage and healing time expected). I kept trying to think of ways to gain muscle without taxing the arm (and more importantly the rotator cuff) so weights were out. Then I thought about VR and for the first time in months played the short intro to Vanishing Grace -to see if I could. I used my left arm to help my right arm with some of the actions as it was still too weak. That was enough to get me wondering if I could use VR with something a little more focused on strengthening vs just playing. So, just today I tried FitXR - right arm was noticeably weaker and I can't quite manage to through a full right hook but I have to say of the four sessions I played I went from not being able to throw a punch to throwing a full punch with a little bit of weight behind. I'm amazed at how much this helped me on the first day. I don't know how much further I can take it or if the return will be as great as it was today but it's extremely promising. 
Thank you for making this - I never thought a VR game would help bring my arm back."
1805,King,"Apr 16, 2021 at 4:01 PM",4,Love FitXR,The new layout is cumbersome to me.  I enjoyed having my purchased packs in a central location for easy access.

1806,Pete,"Mar 16, 2021 at 11:50 PM",5,Great substitute for the boxing gym,"Since not being able to get to the KOBOX gym due to lockdown I've needed to keep my fitness level up.  Not easy with a full time job and family all shielding at home.

I have had BoxVR on the PSVR previously and loved it but the cable was an issue. Since getting the Quest I've enjoyed BoxVR so much more. 

The game gets progressively more demanding as you go through the built in sessions which is brilliant.

Two things I wish were better, the testing of songs to find a good one, it takes ages for each one to start.  The other thing is the graphics.  I wish they were sharper.

Excellent fitness game though, just watch your form when using."

1812,Jayce,"Apr 22, 2021 at 4:19 PM",4,Good home workout,"I play this game mostly for the boxing part since the lockdowns and curfews that followed the start of the pandemic. It cannot replace a proper boxing training because you don't get correction for bad posture and movement and there is no footwork but it still provides a fun and motivating way to exercice. You can also use resistance bands to add some slight muscle and speed building. The last update brought a new gorgeous interface, yet quite impractical compared to the previous one. I wish they could fix the sorting and filtering system and improve navigation overall because having to scroll using the tiny arrows is a real pain (for me at least). I'm also experiencing some lag in the main lobby using a 1st generation oculus quest. I didn't buy any of the DLC packs at the time so the free trial allows me to discover new content. I just hope to find all the content I used to have access to before the update if I decide not to subscribe by the end of the trial."
1813,Jon,"Apr 16, 2021 at 12:30 PM",4,Good fitness option but not perfect,"Offers a choice of boxing or dance related routines, varying from a few minutes to almost an hour with varying levels of intensity. So something for everyone and a choice of music, even if there is too much hip hop style for my taste (but that's just me). The boxing routines feel like a good workout, the dance routines feel more like a game. Biggest issue I have is you have to punch the air way too hard to register a correct hit, and this is bad for your joints. It was fine when it was BoxVR but the revamp introduced this issue and I wish they would allow you to adjust this. Also ignore the 1 star reviews just because this is moving to a subscription model, some people can't seem to read as you don't lose your original content. It's not perfect but it's still my favourite fitness app."
1814,TOFU'S Mama,"Apr 16, 2021 at 9:26 AM",4,I love this app AS IS...,"I really love fit xr so much that i convinced my oculus friends and family to all get it because I saw results!  My arms, abs and back got toned and I owe it to the fantastic workouts the app offers.  

This app has been my go to because the workouts range from 3 minutes to 60 minutes, so I pick what to do depending on how much time I have.  There are no excuses.   I really love this app just as it is and I really do not want to pay a subscription fee to enjoy the workouts I am currently enjoying now.  

I think the wording on the update is confusing so developers, please confirm:  if I don‚Äôt want to subscribe do I get to keep the current content?  The wording on the update is confusing ... it says the app will stay as is without losing previously PURCHASED content.  What does this mean?  Does this mean all the music and workouts we had prior to the update will still be available outside a subscription because it came with the app which we paid around $30 for?

Please also confirm... is multiplayer available only as part of the subscription?  Or is that available at no extra charge.  This is the part of the update I‚Äôm excited about so I am hoping it‚Äôs free to enjoy with my friends and family. 

Thanks so much for making a fun, challenging, heart pounding app that is really welcome during this pandemic.  I really just hope I can continue sweating along to all the fabulous workouts and music as it is right now without needing to pay extra."

As for the app: I like punching stuff to music, so it works for me :)"
1816,BrittanyIsMe,"May 4, 2021 at 5:02 PM",3,Was 5 stars before update,"I used to love this app. I even bought 3 packs and recommended it to everyone I know with an oculus. The recent update is truly awful. The new interface looks nice, but is less organized and there‚Äôs no longer filtering of genre, length and intensity. I feel like it‚Äôs mostly Electronic music now, which is the biggest reason for knocking down stars. The songs are not fun or motivating to work out to and don‚Äôt line up with the punches or squats. A lot of times it feels like I‚Äôm just flailing around rather than being in a boxing class. The songs are actually annoying, in my opinion, and make it so I can‚Äôt finish a 10 minute round before getting irritated and quitting. Developers need to think past aesthetics and what is an easy interface. We‚Äôre spending more time in the songs/workouts than in the home screen. Spend more time on the game and less on how pretty the selection screen is. 
This would be a 2-star review but I like the overall game, and still have fondness for when it was good, and for adding the playing with friends feature."
1817,LastJediUnicorn,"Apr 16, 2021 at 5:04 AM",4,I've been using this since they started.,"I bought this with the original Oculus years ago, back when it was called Box VR. They've made significant changes since then. When they changed to FitXR I didn't like that you couldn't create your own song list anymore. There also took away the variety of backgrounds. However, FitXR has some cool new features. I like the dance classes, and the quality is better. 

Now there is a new update...

I like the update, here is what I don't like. 

#1 something is up with the sound during the session. The music and instructor sounds muffled. Like you're listening to a cheap radio. 

- Another thing, it looks like they're moving to a subscription, which disappoints me because I'll only get what I paid for. If I want to try the upcoming HIIT feature I'll have to pay out more. 

-You can no longer sort the classes by time, genre, etc. 

What I like about the new update...

-The home screen
-New backgrounds"

1820,MadMax,"Apr 17, 2021 at 1:27 PM",3,An honest review of the current update,"Instead of review-bombing and venting my frustration, I'll try to give feedback to the devs about the latest update to FitXR.

First and foremost: devs, if you overhaul your game, don't take away stuff we paid for and stuff we've gotten used to. Why does it say ""coming back soon"" on the glove settings? Why did you take those out at all? The main game of BoxVR has not changed at all, so what prompted you to remove options and entire classes from it? All of my favourites are still there, so that's good for me, but it seems that entire instructors have been taken out of the app. I paid 23 bucks for that content and you are taking some of it out, only to ""maybe"" bring it back later? That is simply not good enough. Rule #1 when updating software is not to break something. You broke A LOT.

I find 10‚Ç¨ per month for a subscription comically expensive, so I don't plan to subscribe and I wonder which of the classes available to us now will be locked away after the trial is over. Will we actually keep the stuff we paid for when we bought the app or the packs, which you also ""accidentally"" removed for people who bought them? Oh, and why can I no longer buy any of those packs? You want me to subscribe, right? Yeah... not gonna happen.

The UI, while having a clean look, leaves a lot to be desired. It's flat instead of curved so it's hard to read text at an angle. You have to use the laser pointer for EVERYTHING instead of B and the stick to move through menus! And you can no longer sort classes except by instructor and category. That is simply not good enough and should have gotten another week of work before release. Again you took away functionality we had before. Remember rule #1!

Anyway... the game is the same as before and most of the content is still there, so I'll keep boxing. I'm also looking forward to the HIIT classes and playing with friends. Unless that requires a subscription..."
1821,Life is Energy,"Apr 22, 2021 at 12:32 PM",3,It changed,"Update 21-04-21: The game has changed a lot. I do like the layout. It looks crisp. But it is really hard to find classes on a certain lvl right now. Before one was able to search on gerne, lvl etc but now only selection on instructor is possible. It's rather inconvenient to have to go through all songs...
Furthermore, when I bought the game I bought it with the intention of having it to buy once. I selected this game because it didn't have a subscription. I've read other reviews and the devs promise that all songs that were available before and the extra packages bought will also be available after the 90 days of free subscription. If that's true it's nice but I do hope that I will not have to go through all non available extra songs just to find the content still playable without subscription.
Because...sorry to say...I'm really not interested in a subscription. When I bought the game it was a buy-once game and for me it stays that way. 

At this moment the cons for me are: 
hard to find the trainings on lvl; not knowing how the game will be after the 90 day free trial; will the content I've bought be available indefinitly or will the game change again after a while...
Pros: the trainings are nice, the surroundings are nice, it looks crisp.

My review before:
I really love this game. It gives me a good sweat when going for the explosive streak.

There are a couple of things that would make this game even better.

1) To be able to access the game without internet. Without an internet connection fitXR hangs on the loading screen. This one is really important to me. My wifi is rather unstable at the space I'm playing this game. In the description it states that an internet connection is required for downloadable content. This made me believe that it would be possible to download the content and then be able to play  even when the wifi goes off. But without an internet connection fitXR hangs on the loading screen.

2) A warming up and cooling down is missing. Mostly I play a 15 min training. In order to warm up I now start the first 5 min really easy without going for explosive streaks. The following 5 min I go for the explosive streak and the last 5 min I go really easy again. But this means that one gets lesser points, a lower max streak etc. It would be really nice to be able to choose wether or not one would like to have a warming up or cooling down before/after a training (which does count for calories and fitxr points but not for the lvl, streak and points one gets for the training itself).

Update: in december 2020 the game updated with the possibility to choose 'training mode'. In this way every punch will count for the punch streak. This is a nice update.  Still I personally miss the possibility to choose a warming up and/or cooling down within the trainings.

Other than this I really love the game. I also like it that it keeps track of the speed of the punches. It is a fun way to burn some calories. When playing for about 20 minutes with quite some explosive streaks the game estimates that I burned about 200 calories. Ofcourse this is an estimatebut this game really gets my blood pumping when going for the explosive streaks."
1822,Feasties,"Apr 17, 2021 at 6:37 PM",3,Update not so great,"I'm not normally one to complain about an update, but all of the filtering options (intensity, duration, music) have been removed. Scrolling through a long list is not much of an improvement.

My wife decided to try it out and there was no tutorial to be found. 

If you want to make this a subscription, go for it. But removing basic functionality from the experience seems like a step backward to me."
1823,Torrie,"May 3, 2021 at 5:17 AM",3,It is what it is....,"I only recently got this title and from my limited use of it and only that which is free to play / use.  The game seems to be fun and genuinely has me not mind working out.   My doctor has even suggested something like this would be good for me to participate in.   That is however where the praises stop.   A majority of the app is set behind a paywall that exceeds what the app is truly worth.   
I am wondering are the instructors that are shown on the selection screens even instructors or even involved with this at all?   During gameplay / workouts or whatever they are called the voice over is always the same voice.   when you do see instructors it could be anybody as it is a cgi of an instructor, and yet again with the very same voice.   disconcerting when the instructor is suppose to be male and voice you are hearing is female sounding.   

Stay sub free and this program is worth it.   If you insist on paying for your workouts I am sure there are better ones out there ( i have not found them yet ) with far better deals as well.   

I heard peoples reviews saying it is buggy i however did not experience any bugs atleast that i am aware of."

1828,srgalactica,"Apr 19, 2021 at 6:30 PM",4,Regarding the new update,Really happy with the new update despite the little things still being worked out (like the filters). I had gotten really bored having no new workouts. I will most likely go ahead and subscribe. It's worth it to me to have fun at-home cardio options. I love FitXR and Supernatural. Both seem to hit a little different and between both I feel like I get the cardio I need. One thing SN had that FitXR didn't was new content daily. So this update hits on that.
1829,Smjay26,"Apr 30, 2021 at 2:21 AM",3,Unhappy Update Pros/Cons,"First of all let me say I used FitXR religiously practically 7 days a week for 45mins to an hour each day. I realized I was getting a wonderful cardio in because when My oculus broke down I had to switch back to the boring elliptical which seemed so easy in comparison. So I know this game is a great work out game. However with that in mind, the new update has me a little annoyed and Ive cut back to using it maybe 3 times a week now.

Pros: 
-Excellent music
-New class each day excites me. Keeps it's fresh instead of stale
-Fairly accurate calorie count to see progress you've made
-Excellent workout that will get your heart pumping
-Heck, boxing is fun!

Cons: 
- The class search feature is missing
-Have to scroll through classes one by one instead of finding a class based on length, intensity, music style, or instructor
-Hit detecrion is pretty inaccurate again. I recently started real boxing on a heavy bag and reflex bag and suddenly Im not hitting the targets hard enough or fast enough??? I dont think so lol Ive gained muscle and speed since doing the real thing and this game makes me feel I'm back at square one lol
- Im not a fan of all those downward hits.....sure it adds variety but no one punches like that....groin shots usually are illegal lol
-Every new class has a TON of squats which before u could filter out a bit. Sometimes i just want to work my upper body ya know
-Need new environments. They are getting really old
-The subscription part...ya....not happy with 
- Need to add a cool down for players or warm up to prevent injury. I pulled several muscles the first time I started using this so think that should be an additional feature
-I miss the days when we could creat our own workout routine/select songs from BoxXR."

I'm pretty out of shape as of this writing, but this is going to change.  I'm already feeling stronger, more stamina, more energy.  I love a boxing workout (I used to dabble with kickboxing), and this is PERFECT for the person who doesn't want to go to the gym, wants to stay home and be private about their workout.  So many different options, workouts... be competitive - or not.  I saw someone mention that the beats didn't match the hits very well and yeah... there is that.  But still, it keeps you on track with power punches and motivates you with the upbeat music.

1846,Carol,"Mar 23, 2021 at 10:06 PM",4,Fairly new to FITxr,"I started about 2 months ago. I go through the box routines, not enough to memorize them. I've tried the dance once or twice,  I'm not skilled in dance at all therefore not comfortable .. yet.  The music is not my typical genre, I don't know any of it. The idea is to make you move and it does do that. Box with squats will make you sweat.  I wish they would put a heart on the class boxes, so I can tell which are my favorites. Overall, I'm happy with it, and would recommend it to someone who wants a workout."

1848,HoneyBunnyRiri,"Mar 3, 2021 at 7:57 PM",1,Just get BeatSaber or something else.,"I was so excited about this app. This was actually the reason why I wanted to buy an Oculus sooooo much; however, I was so let down by the design. For a perfectionist, it's frustrating to not be able to get the left & right hooks as well as the uppercuts because the game's accuracy is off. I play it twice total. The first time it was unsatisfying knowing that I hit those but they were not recognized. Then I decided to give it another chance, and ofcourse, uber frustrated this time because I was really going for the stress relief and satisfaction of just punching the heck out of the ""notes"". Anyways, I am a bit sad that I will not be able to refund this. Another boooo thing about it is that you have to make additional purchases for longer workouts. The basic pack comes with ~8 3 min a couple 10 min and 1 20min workout, big eye roll here. Anyways, if they can fix the accuracy issue, the game would be 10x better."

I asked for more squating & I got it now there is to much it makes my back hurt & I get tired very fast. 
            I love the daily classes but not everyone is at an advance point in their exercising routine. So maybe once or twice a week at most but everyday makes me not want to do it especially when it's all squating lol I freaking love this game & I'm losing inches & weight from it. I can't wait until it's been a mth. And I can show everyone. Do it it's worth it 100% worth it! 










I love the boxing part wish it had better tracking though & more squating, I absolutely love the dance part again needs better tracking  & slower classes for the ones who aren't used to moving like this its hard to follow all those movements so fast. Needs more classes for it being such an expensive game. Nobody wants to pay 30 dollars then pay 10 more then 15 more. All in all its an awesome game,worth the money  & a lot of fun to do. I feel like it's working on my weight loss it just needs some adjustments & it will be amazing üëèüôå"

Going through a warm up and high intensity and then a cool down. I usually do this but have to do 3 different classes. I would also like to see In the class description what they focus on. Like if it is the lower or upper body."

1856,Bolax,"Apr 22, 2021 at 10:00 PM",4,It's quite the workout.,"The workouts can be quite hardcore, they aren't kidding when they say a level is  high intensity.  You will be sweating, especially if you are using the speed section thing (it's a mode that only counts a sequential hit if you are actually putting force behind your punch).  

Fun Fact: I managed to pull a shoulder muscle playing this game, by punching to hard and it took a week to recover. lol.

Pros:
The new park environment is much improved.
The tracking after the last patch feels spot on and accurate.
The leaderboards are fun.

Cons:
Needs a way to be in the same game with your friends.  We can both start the same song at the same time, but we cannot connect to each other, IE we are not in the same game, we can just tell each other how we did...  So you can only do a session with strangers.
Needs more environments
NEEDS MORE/BETTER MUSIC, the stuff they have right now is painfully generic and really not my style.

Update:
Honestly the last patch has really made launching the workout I want a choir.  They need to have a sort by length feature and not dump 22min+ at the front.  Also it seems the tracking gets worse the longer I play, about 6 min into a round and my fist will randomly go through a orb rather than pop it ruining my streak.  Very frustrating...  Keeping it a 4 stars for now though in hopes they improve it."
1857,Ginny,"Feb 16, 2021 at 7:48 PM",4,FitXR,"I am not a young person yet I really enjoy this app. I especially like the boxing portion because it's highly adjustable to preferences that make it easy enough for me to use and yet younger, more fit people could get a great workout from it.  But mostly I like it because it is really really fun. The music is enjoyable and the orbs are much easier to hit than with beat saber. You can adjust the level so that you get more of a workout and the punching can be faster and harder. They even let you remove the 
Sqats when you want to. The first time I use this app I was having so much fun that after 20 minutes the squats did me in and I couldn't walk well for a couple days without that wobbly feeling. Once I admitted that my quads were weak I removed the squats and now I'm having the time of my life and working up a sweat. This is a fantastic game. I have not used the dancing much yet but it does provide a nice solid workout. Love this app. only gave it four stars because I hope in future they will come up with a couple of extra things to do here. Maybe stretches or something.

It‚Äôs no beat saber for sure and it feels sometimes a little off, but at the end of the day this thing is a beast!  I tried the dancing part.....and I now know I am not meant to dance.

Great workout with boxing plus various levels to challenge yourself. I think of myself as being pretty coordinated as I‚Äôm a fitness instructor teaching aerobic dance but doesn‚Äôt seem to be any consistency with the tracking. I just use dance bit to warmup or cool down. Also found that some of the more jumping moves (star jumps in particular)were really uncomfortable with the pressure of headset on face.
1877,Gryffindork83,"Apr 16, 2021 at 12:35 PM",3,WAS an epic game but still epic workout,"UPDATE: So I was dreading jumping on fitxr this morning after seeing the news everything had gone subscription based. I even checked the latest reviews to see what people were saying about it and you have lost most of your customer base. So after trying the update for myself...all I can say is, GROW UP PEOPLE!

Do I agree that it has gone subscription based? NO
Do I think it's a shady tactic? YES

NEW LOOK: Love it, menu system is simple and sleek. Loving the ability to change the home environment in the future. Found all my saved favourites after about 30 seconds and jumped straight in to my usual routine üëç
GRAPHICS: Not sure but I think it's had a major resolution boost. Looks much more crisp üëç
SUBSCRIPTION: I jumped straight into the 90 day free trial and will try some of the tracks but I will NOT be subscribing as I purchased a game, not access to a service. Will be interesting to see what experience I will get once the free trial ends.
COMMUNICATION: Terrible, just terrible. I would have liked to have had a little warning prior to the update so I could have purchased a few more dlc packs. Guess I'm stuck with what I've got now. 
OVERALL: For Existing customers it's not the ins of the world, Multiplayer and a graphics boost. It's new customers I feel sorry for, although I dint think you'll get many new customers once they read the reviews. I think you've royally given yourselves the shaft and I think you need to find a way of apologising to your existing customer base. 
I did give 4/5 but now, just out of principle for the shady tactics in gonna give it a 3/5.



Is it worthy of your hard earned furlough? Yes...with caveats. If your looking to get the heart going, stretch those muscles or build up a sweat then this is perfect (boxing). The only issue I have is there doesn't seem to be alot of high tempo songs. The only insane one I have found so far is 'SWEAT' in the absolute box pack and a couple higher tempo workouts in the base game. Some say they are intense workouts but the are slow and boring so expect to buy all the packs looking for the right song but once you find them... you'll be hurting if you put the effort in.  Unless I'm being stupid there is no way to make a playlist of workouts other than adding to favourites. I spend an hour each morning so a workout playlist would be helpful. The only thing I really want to see is a way to add your own music, say connect to Spotify and auto generate a workout to the beat of the songs. Other than that... well done to the creator's üëç"
1878,Paul,"Apr 16, 2021 at 6:31 PM",3,Update - A messy April update,"UPDATE APRIL, 2021 - minus two stars:

I don‚Äôt actually mind what the company has done with subscription plan. Instead of having to wait forever to get new classes they release a new one every day. They‚Äôre adding another studio for high intensity workouts which is great. They‚Äôre adding more environments which is great. All of this I think it‚Äôs worth the money - Apple fitness is $10 a month and you get new classes regularly there too. It‚Äôs fair. 

What‚Äôs also very very fair is allowing existing owners of the game to keep all their classes and purchased DLC. That way nobody got sold a bill of goods that turned into a lie. Everybody who bought the app before it gets to keep everything that they had in the boxing and dance areas. 

What‚Äôs not fair and totally sucks is the new interface to select workouts which has lost the ability to look for workouts by time or intensity. That is absolute rubbish! Who thought that was a good idea? It‚Äôs a fundamental basic part of using the application. Now you have to scroll forever to find what you want. It‚Äôs truly a disaster. As if someone made a decision while drunk to do that. 

Come ON. 

Other than that the only other thing I can suggest is to clarify the messaging in the application as to how subscriptions work for existing users. It‚Äôs not clear. And there is mention of an ‚Äúautomatic renewal‚Äù subscription (good for 90 days) for existing users that you have to go shut off but uh‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no way currently to shut it off. 

And there is zero way to tell what is part of the subscription, and what you got to keep from the old application.

That‚Äôs really a massive level of idiocy in design. 

These newly introduced problems are really too bad because ultimately the application IS getting better and better, and the subscription model will allow the application to continue to improve and is reasonably priced. The company is also being very generous in giving all the existing owners everything that they already had.

I just think someone at the company and Facebook needs to really think about things instead of making truly asinine decisions to core functionality, and scaring their existing users to death. 

Old review, prior to April 2021:

This is a review coming from someone that lost 20 pounds using boxVR and had it replaced the gym for me as a primary mode of cardio exercise during the pandemic.

The new version is better in every way. The graphics look a lot better, the feedback from the virtual instructors is much better when it used to be nonexistent. All of downloadable music is still there. You you still feel like you‚Äôre going into a gym.

The game mechanic is basically the same, but it has been tweaked to have you punch harder and move more. Which is the goal. You won‚Äôt get much of a workout if you don‚Äôt punch hard and fast!!

In the old game it was possible to really not get any exercise at all by just kind of swinging and hitting targets. You can do that here too, but you won‚Äôt get all the positive feedback or the better streaks.Ôøº

The calorie count is displayed on the dashboard when you login or after your workout. People aren‚Äôt even looking. It‚Äôs right there in front of your face, although it is not shown during the work out which I agree should be brought back. Or get an Apple Watch and look down at it through the nose hole on your headset every few minutes. I do think it should come back though.

Overall I find this an incredibly impressive upgrade in every single way. And for free!! If you can open your mind up to change, I think if you use it a little while too too will also be very impressed.

Pros:
- much much better graphics 
- players are rewarded for doing actual work that raises the heart rate
- the feedback is great to hear even if rote; keeps you motivated 
- the targets are a little easier to hit and offer much more visual feedback to help guide you I to working out more 
- squats are lower and make you actually work 
- I‚Äôm getting higher HR out of the new workouts (the old medium is now hard)
- there are tutorial videos that show you how to actually have the correct stance and punches 
- the gym looks beautiful and futuristic yet is still a gym / building 

My list of suggestions/cons:

UPDATE: removing one star as I‚Äôve worked out with this for a few days now extensively. I still enjoy it but there definitely needs to be some improvements. Ôøº

- offer a daytime version of the gym in addition to the night version that is there now. I love what they put in, but a lot of people could be upset being in such a dark environment (done)
- Bring back the real time calorie count please
- when you play multiplayer sometimes the other players just stop. And I think that‚Äôs because they stopped playing the game. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on there (fixed)
- make it easier to sort the classes by duration. I miss that.Ôøº (fixed then broken again)
- add a tutorial video for people coming from boxVR to explain the differences and changes
- A good number of the old classes and old songs teams to be gone. I wish they would bring them back. Some of the songs were really good to work out to. 
- I agree that some of the part of all FX should be turned down just slightlyyyy unless it‚Äôs a super hard hit. During extremely intense of workouts sometimes your vision can get cluttered with all of the explosions. 
- and the number of the workouts I feel like the beat count is off or the tracking is a little off. I‚Äôm not sure if some background processing is happening or something, but in a couple of the workouts that I‚Äôve had recently it didn‚Äôt seem like the beats were perfectly timed. I was also missing hits that I know for a fact I made. It seems like a little tweak to the tracking on occasion would be helpful. I don‚Äôt want to note that this was more of a rare occurrence than a common occurrence. But I did notice it on occasion"
1879,Rockmalvin,"Mar 31, 2021 at 11:13 AM",5,Love it.,I play it everyday. It's fun. I'm missing two things. The option to set the height of the balls. Endurance run where it goes nonstop till you give up.

Tracks all progress and calories burned and there is sooo much to do in terms of different workouts, haven't tried out the dance side of it yet but I'm more focused on shadow boxing anyway. I see a lot of people complaining about it being over ¬£70 with the other add-ons but I mean come on think about it! ¬£70 is pretty much a month maybe a month and a half of a gym membership but with this you get a lot more and can use it over and over! ¬£70 is penny's for what you get with the extras. Even the base ¬£22.99 game give you more then you need anyway. If I could give it more stars I would."
1882,StuBo,"Mar 27, 2021 at 12:11 PM",4,The best for me,"Having pretty much tried them all, I find this to be the best of the Quest games aimed at providing a good workout, and personally prefer it to the big sabre-swinging one. I have lost weight and feel generally better after committing to a minimum of a 30 minute session a day using it. 

After 30 mins or so with correct form, shadow boxing with long runs of squats interspersed becomes a suprisingly gruelling workout, and - with target punching gameplay that has been refined to be pretty faultless - this game makes it fun and interesting to get lost in it for that long and longer, to the point that you forget you're even working out. It is also motivating to compete against a bunch of opponents, (though actually just replays of other players' previous performances).

Would be a 5 star for me, but for a few minor grumbles:

There are relatively few workouts in the time and intensity bracket I want to use, so I have got a quite bored with them. I haven't found great value in the expensive dlc packs, and like how other similar apps offer a wider selection and frequent free additions (the holy grail being the means to import your own tracks). I appreciate the addition of the 'dance' routines, but find these much less fun (even though I am definitely an amazing dancer) and a less effective workout not well suited to my playspace (I'm a large man with old wooden floors), so I don't use them.

Small bugs/ux issues: some routines don't feature squats, despite the big 'squats' box being ticked on the level entry screen. Stance (left/right) foot forward should appear permanently on the hud, so if you break from a routine you're reminded of the correct stance. 

Multiplayer could be so much more. A lobby system that allowed live competitive sessions would open up the incredible motivation of reacting to your opponents' performance in real time (watch them race ahead or struggle to keep up etc). A 1v1 mode, matched by skill rating, where your opponents avi and their full per-punch stats were in your eyeline would be incredible, but maybe asking a bit much of the hardware! 

Overall I highly recommend FitxXR."

4) Maybe a stretching guide

Otherwise, a great and extremely useful title!"
1884,Jimmy-WiiAr,"Apr 14, 2021 at 1:54 PM",3,In the beginning it was the best thing!,"At first I couldn't believe how much fun the workouts were and how much calories I burned. I was also surprised that I gained a measurable amount of upper body muscles. Dynamite is the best workout ever. BUT ... once you know most of the workout routines that are good for you and match your skill level, there isn't much more. Where are the packs? I would be happy to throw 10 bucks your way every month, if I got diversified and interesting new workouts regularly. The last pack (Absolute Box Pack) was a total bummer. No flow, too little in-rhythm punching for my taste, too many squats in a row (nothing against squats, but that was too much). If it wouldn't become too boring, I would work out almost every day. PLEASE FITXR KEEP ME INTERESTED AND MOTIVATED. Hire a team of workout creators, use some license free music and go for it! PLEEEASE!"

1886,MichelleandJohn,"Apr 25, 2021 at 2:47 AM",2,Terrible update,Frustrating functionality. Update was quite the set back
1887,Libbyville,"Mar 5, 2021 at 11:03 AM",5,Love it!,Bought this game 3 weeks ago and I am addicted to the boxing! Super happy as I am now finally working out and enjoying it! Burnt a 1000 calories plus and still going strong at least three times a week. A blessing during these lock down times as I am eating way more than usual.üòä after a serious operation two years ago this is getting me off the sofa and into gear! Thank you!! I have seen complaints here about costly updates but I think initial content is quite good and there is a daily changing new boxing program which will give you a  brand new 10-15 min workout. Love the dance music!
1888,kevinwalsh2,"Mar 6, 2021 at 2:54 AM",5,Highly recommend it,"Started using this app. And I've got to say am very impressed. 

I've not be very active over the last few year with mental health issues.
I've started using this around 3 weeks ago 
1st week was hard to get use to doing some kind of workout daily 30 minutes a day.
2nd week I was up to an hour dally 
3rd week am up to 1hrs 30 minutes every  morning. Great start to the day

And in truth i feel amazing I can feel the difference in my body and I can 100% tell you that workout on this app daily has improved my mental health.

The only thing negative is when building up a streak I find the tracking jumps out slightly and you miss a uppercut or hook and it kills your streak. But that's a tiny little problem. 
Fantastic app highly recommend."
1889,Jarmago,"Mar 5, 2021 at 2:25 PM",5,Fun boxing workout,"I‚Äôm a 52 year old woman who is trying to get back into shape. I used to like going to the gym to workout, but as I‚Äôve gotten older I have lost interest. I purchased the oculus thinking i would use it for exercise, and this is one of the first games i purchased and the one i keep going back to. There‚Äôs not a whole lot of variety to the boxing workouts, but it is enough to keep you moving and your heart pumping and it definitely isn‚Äôt boring. The workout mainly consists of a variety of punches with some obstacles thrown in prompting you to dodge or squat. The dance workouts are fine, but i stick more with the boxing because it is what i enjoy."
1890,KC,"Mar 5, 2021 at 12:41 PM",5,Get this,Gotta say I was a bit reluctant to get this but def glad I did. Some of the best money I've spent. If ur looking for a good workout with a little bit of healthy competition in the classes then u gotta buy this. Only have it a few days but I don't stop till I can't keep going. A little bit addicted to it I think. Worth every penny
1891,Whatacarrier,"Mar 30, 2021 at 7:49 AM",3,It started out great,This game started out really amazing and was looking forward to playing it every day. After about a months time I started to get bored with the same continuous workouts at the same pace with no change. The problem I have with this app is there is no change nor increase to a workout of the ones that they provide. I think a helpful change would be a workout plan to warm you up and cool you down also maybe an increase in how the certain workouts will increase as you perform better or levels to make it harder. I've had the app about 4 months and I've only seen more paid items available with no change to the regular app. Also please describe what is included with purchasing of different DLCs.
1892,Amanda,"Feb 27, 2021 at 2:47 AM",5,A great workout!!,"I absolutely LOVE this game!!! Im drenched in sweat after 15 mins of boxing! This is one of the very few games that I don‚Äôt get motion sickness from. I‚Äôm not a fan of the dancing aspect of this game, but the boxing is amazing!!! If the developers can add additional backgrounds, and when you level up if the speed can increase as well it would make this game alot more intense and fun!"
1893,Theodorabarbarian,"Mar 4, 2021 at 5:15 PM",5,Best purchase so far,"I use this app everyday. It‚Äôs brilliant in the way it combines gaming theory and a full body work out. 
It feels like being inside a video game and when you‚Äôre done you‚Äôre sweating and feel great. 
There are different levels and options which is awesome. I started on 3 min classes everyday. I‚Äôve now worked up to 2x 10 min classes daily. The app recommends classes based on your activity.
My younger sister and 70 yr old mother are now really into it and do 3-6 min a day. The first time my mother tried it she took off the headset and said, ‚Äòwow, can I do it again?‚Äô"
1894,Kia,"Apr 14, 2021 at 10:13 PM",3,Great workout (box). Stability issues.,"Great workout app. Significantly better than subscription services like Supernatural, mainly because I have the option of turning off the trainers, and if they are on, it doesn't make me feel like I'm in a cult. 

Some more variety of music and workout would be  bonus, but it's not a huge issue. I definitely don't use the dance feature of the app at all - I would personally prefer more dedicated development to the boxing, but I understand that some people might enjoy it. 

New update crashed and bricked my Oculus Quest 2, however, which forced a Factory Reset. It works now, but that was a nuisance I could have done without."
1895,Adrian,"Mar 16, 2021 at 4:41 PM",4,Could be perfect,"I really like this app.
A 20 minute intense workout trying very hard not to miss any punch is extremely taxing and I will poor sweat like on a hard (real) running session. So cool !

Still, there are a few things that I find infuriating...

1) The $10 addons are really a ""cheap"" money grab. I hate it and it gives a very negative impression of the company editing this game.

2) Every now and then a punch will mysteriously miss. It's really very frustrating when you just gave it all for the last 500+ punch streak and suddenly you miss despite hitting very hard. This is a core game mechanism !

3) ""Muliplayer game mode"" is not a multiplayer game mode. You just ""play against"" previsously recorded session of random players. Please pretty please bring some real multiplayer mode because this game is made for it ! Something similar to beat Saber.

4) Sorry but the music is mostly lame and the punches are often not even really synchronised to it. This too should be something mastered by the devs with a title like this.

So, still a very good game that I recommand for mostly everyone. The points above can all be addressed (and should be)."

1899,Jojo,"Apr 22, 2021 at 4:54 PM",4,,"I enjoy playing this game but I can't afford to pay for a subscription to all the workout apps. Each one is around 10 a month. However,  It is a very good work out and cardio app.  I wish there was maybe a couple more different longer classes free."
1900,Christian Stephan,"Nov 18, 2020 at 8:15 PM",4,Great for working out but...,I love this game. I use it every day as part of my workout routine. it doesn‚Äôt feel like working out. I also love that there are group classes and you can actually win by scoring the most points. My only complaint would be that I have three other friends with oculus quest and there should be some type of way to invite them to a work out so that  we are working out together. Like create a private room. As of right now we could both pick the same work out at the exact same time and end up being in different classes.

You can select a workout based on time and intensity. The better you do the tougher it gets. I track these workouts on my Apple Watch and consistently burn 300+ cals in a 30 minute session made up of multiple mini workouts.

1906,rsthiswayup,"Mar 6, 2021 at 9:06 AM",4,Awesome but....,"Love this, use it daily as part of my routine, the update encourages you to hit harder to maintain your streak and stay top of the leader board but  as others have said though, would be great if you could join friends and compete against 'live' people instead of AI. Some workouts could be better timed. Minor points, overall I love this. Edit: One point I forgot to mention, would be good if the longer workouts were more structured; you get (well I do) quite a sweat on when doing this, would be good if water breaks were part of the routine, I sometimes find that if my water bottle is outside my guardian it can cause issues when I try and rejoin. Pausing for water is OK but would be better if it was planned and you knew how long you had. Some breaks between songs are very short some are longer but you never know which one it is while it's going on. Other than that keep up the great work."

We used to love competing with each member of the family but now no score tables to be seen, 2nd is just a minor one but I can't tell which workouts I've completed... there is no tick or my previous score to show me my progress... 3rd, even though I now get the dance workouts (which I don't play) the boxing workouts have been cut back and most of my favourite music from the psvr version has been removed... and 4... where are the custom playlists? Or at least a list of songs in each workout? I know a lot of psvr owners are waiting for the fitvr update but I feel most of them are going to be deeply disappointed when it finally arrives."

1912,sousinho,"Mar 14, 2021 at 10:17 PM",3,"Decent, but needs a lot of improvement","It's a decent fitness game, especially during lockdown but has some basic fundamental features missing.  

You should be able to see you high scores / stats for each song so you can choose to improve on them.  You literally haha no idea until you've played it.

Not much variation. The songs/ beats her boring after a while.  Lack of any customisation is also surprising. 

How about a local or global scoreboard??  2 stages?? Lack of being able to play your own songs??

Hopefully something better comes along but this will do for now unless the developers seriously take a look at adding !ore features."

I've only played it 15 minutes and I've already accidentally opened the menu in the middle of action 4 (!!!) times with my right hand.

1917,Dbeck,"Feb 25, 2021 at 1:03 PM",5,I‚Äôm addicted,"Having gained the quarantine 20+ , I needed an exercise routine to complement my adjusted eating routine.  This has been a phenomenally motivating way to get moving and get my heart rate up.   I‚Äôve basically stuck with the boxing side (my dance moves suck lol) and Work Hard is my must do routine often paired with one or two others.  This is the first week of working out everyday so I‚Äôll need to come back and share any significant losses.  My target date for ultimate loss is May first.  I‚Äôve been using my Apple Watch and My Plate to track activity and calories so we shall see.  This has been way better the my stationary bike!

This is a whole new version and  I do not like being forced to give you my email address and to have always be online to play . Why didn't you warn us? A little note some place to keep people from wondering where BoxVr went...or that it's been replaced would have been nice it took me 30 mins to discover what had happened... I also have BOXVR via Steam for my WMR headset and it didn't change so that makes it even more confusing..  This is the second time you've made major changes and didn't warn us.. I hate losing my playlist,  But after leaving my first review I went back in and played for another 15 minutes and I actually like the improved game play and the arena is OK, So I came in to change my review.  I really would like to have an option for the other two Gyms day and night too... its a Mood thing... anyway please do not pull the rug out from under us loyal fans again..  I like the new Balls and Bars Graphics. Things still need some tweaking and Multiplayer is weird, but as long as I can do my workouts I am ok . I was able to do that and choose a new favorites list. So OK just give us some warning in the future, somehow, please. One other thing are you changing the Steam version too?"

I will agree with the last review, some of the timing to music is off, and the music taste is very bias. Could do with a lot more mainstream rock and classic rock songs, that meet a wider range of music taste. Very limited, either too techno or far to heavy!

My biggest issue at the moment is that it doesnt work with the new experimental feature to create multiple accounts.

Just an idea :)"

First couple of days of boxing on this game I was aching all over. The dancing side not so good. It‚Äôs ok if your good a picking up moves while watching as it happens but no good for someone like me that likes to see the move that‚Äôs coming up before it happens!! 5 stars for the boxing 2 star for the dancing!!

1947,Paul H,"Mar 14, 2021 at 4:37 PM",3,Becoming an exercise in frustration,"Hands down this app will give you the best workout on quest.  It doesn't play like a game, so don't expect that, but it's still a fun way to get moving, get sweating, and get that heart rate up.

Or it was.  Somewhere along the way the coders decided that it should be possible for the app to interpret a jab or an uppercut as throwing your controller across the room.  When this happens you get to watch your hand fly off, your awesome streak end since you no longer have a hand to punch with, and your average punch speed plummets.  You get to respond one of two ways: a) wreck your workout and by stopping and looking at your real hand (missing every target) until the game gives you back your virtual hand or b) try to keep up with the workout hoping the hand will come back eventually and trying not to hyperextend since you have no visual reference for your hand and the target. This is mildly unsafe and frustrating as all get out, but at least I'm not trashing my actual workout this way. 

If they can fix this issue, I might consider buying expansion packs, but not as it currently stands"
1948,a,"Mar 30, 2021 at 12:39 AM",3,It‚Äôs getting better,I‚Äôm going to change my rating from 1 to 3 because they fixed the issue I was facing which was the songs. It‚Äôs much better now. I would give 5 star if they could add up more features for example we can use our earned points to update our gloves so for each punch we will get more points or things like that which will be addictive to continue the workout in order to get more points

1953,SashaQueue,"Jan 29, 2021 at 3:13 PM",5,Love It,"I have absolutely loved working out with FitXR.  I like that you are playing and competing with others, and also with yourself, by beating your previous scores.  It would be nice if there was a way to match you within your own age group.  Even though I am relatively fit for 52, some of these younger people can still put punch me."
1954,AbsAmLoved,"Mar 9, 2021 at 5:54 PM",4,you can't workout with friends,"This workout is perfect except for the fact that you can't workout with friends. like another user mentioned, even if you click the class the same time, you won't be in the same class. The developer should make an update that allows you to choose a class with just your friends or at least be in the same class. Be ready to be sore with the intense punches but gets better as you keep doing it daily. Would have been 5 stars. Lots of classes to choose from. you are sure to find one you like along side the music. I personally do not care about the dance classes. overall good investment. I can still talk with my friends during the workout."

1956,Kastanza,"Mar 11, 2021 at 10:36 PM",3,Could be great!,"My review drops from 5 stars to 3 stars. Like so many other reviews, the main complaint I have is the terrible Tracks!!! But it seems to fall on deaf ears . This game could be great if the developers would listen and start adding a better selection of tracks. !! Don‚Äôt waste the potential of this game because of the music!!!!!"
1957,Elr1c,"Mar 27, 2021 at 5:30 AM",3,Good workout app-need some improvements,"I‚Äôve been using FitXR for about 5 months now as an alternative workout for the days the weather doesn‚Äôt allow me to exercise outdoors. I also own the Rock add on pack.

Pros
- Workouts can be intense and provide good cardio exercise.
- Music is good and in most cases the rhythm matches your punches. 
- Good variety of workouts with varying levels of intensity.
- Ability to play against others which is a good motivator if you like to compete.
- Recent addition of dancing is a fun alternative when you get tired of boxing.


Cons
- Hand tracking can be spotty at times. This doesn‚Äôt happen all the time but it‚Äôs enough to break your punching streak.
- Workout intensity rating is inconsistent. Take  ‚ÄúThunderstruck‚Äù and ‚ÄúRed Lights‚Äù for example. They are both rated as ‚ÄúLight‚Äù intensity. The second one is indeed a light workout. With first one however, you can barely keep up. You will find that some of the workouts labeled as ‚ÄúLight‚Äù fall more under the medium intensity category. Some of the ‚ÄúIntense‚Äù workouts also have this problem.
- Very busy UI: In addition to keeping an eye on the balls coming at you, the UI right in front of you is quite busy. It took me 3 months to discover that in addition to the audio alerts I was hearing, there was also a visual message telling me to ‚ÄúPunch earlier/later‚Äù on top of the very busy UI. 
- Possible cheater problem (or just an annoying bug) : Say you play an 8 minute work out and the maximum achievable hit streak is 500. I‚Äôve come across 2 instances where the top player would have double the streak from what‚Äôs possible and their score would continue to increase regardless of whether they were hitting balls or avoiding obstacles. Could be a bug too.
- (Minor) Not all workouts are voiced. It‚Äôs interesting that all workouts have an assigned trainer. It makes sense when you hear their voice during the workout. What doesn‚Äôt make sense is when a workout has a trainer but it‚Äôs not voiced - why have a trainer in the first place?


Wishlist
- Create a workout playlist. Have a sequence of workouts starting with warmup, workout and then cool down. This could be an alternative to 60 minute workouts.
- Achievements and global standings. Implement achievements other than workout record and streak record. Something that motivates people to do more. Another idea is to implement a global standings scoreboard outside of the specific workout."
1958,MonikaFoster,"Feb 25, 2021 at 8:14 AM",5,"Yep, it works",Had by now several workouts done and they really work- I had sore muscles on places I had no idea  that that is possible.

1959,Cargan,"Apr 8, 2021 at 7:22 AM",3,Really like but...,Myself and my wife both really love the game.  Yet I keep having issues with it registering hits to targets I can easily see I made contact with.  And my wife notices an occasional stuttering that can be annoying.  But over all decent game
1960,Wonderful,"Feb 23, 2021 at 8:21 PM",5,Love this workout!,"This workout is a full body workout, I am pouring with sweat afterwards. The 3 min workouts are good for a warm up or if you are just starting out. I quickly moved into longer more challenging sessions. I really like how this program grows with you. This is part of my daily routine now and it‚Äôs so much fun."
1961,Pyrusman G,"Mar 7, 2021 at 8:52 PM",4,Great for a bit of cardio work out,"Over all, I really like this game.  I have focused solely on the boxing portion and it's been great in terms of getting a nice workout and feeling it the next day. 

There is one aspect that I find confusing or irritating. The timing for the hits to create streaks did not seem to sync with the songs. As a result, (even if I ignore the music) it is not clear as to what is the exact point to time the hits.  

That aside,  I love the game."
1962,Bubby,"Mar 7, 2021 at 6:47 PM",4,Very Good..could use some ‚Äúfixes‚Äù.,"I use this most every day.  I tend to use the same four workouts as I prefer rock music (which this app/game is really lacking).  Every so often the game seems to miss which ends streaks and is frustrating.  I do wish it used popular artists in the classes like Supernatural does.  All that said, I am satisfied with my purchase."
1963,Ela Rox,"Feb 28, 2021 at 10:50 AM",5,Best thing ever!,I absolutely love it! I lost 2.5kg in a month with a change in my diet and a workout on Oculus - FitXR every other day. It's so entertaining! I don't even realise I'm training until one hour has passed and I'm dripping in sweat.

1965,BlazeScream711,"Feb 23, 2021 at 5:34 AM",5,Fun way to workout,"This workout app is easy to start, engaging with great music, and can kick your heart rate into high gear.

1968,Dredmix,"Mar 4, 2021 at 10:40 AM",4,Good exercise game with room to improve,"Overall is a good experience that will give you a good sweat. 
Songs on the beginner sets could be better, something with a bit more rhythm to keep you more motivated. 
Seach and filtering or exercises could also improve, it's a bit hard to find what you're looking for sometimes. Also, there should be an option to save routines that you like and create your own list."
1969,Strydersmom,"Mar 20, 2021 at 4:50 AM",4,Day One,"I'm new to this game but so far I really like it. It is definitely a good workout and I love that there are many options to choose from. What would really make this a five star experience are a few more options, though. For example, you can change your environment--which is awesome--but there are only two possibilities. I'd also like the option to put my controllers down.  It's a bit awkward to dance with them! Losing the  controllers would definitely make the experience more realistic and help me to focus on the moves. Finally, as others have said,  I'd like more variety of music. I'm a big fan of BeatSaber, so it doesn't take too much imagination to consider how fun boxing would be with some contemporary music! Overall, I like this game and will probably be playing quite a bit. I do hope, however, that some of these upgrades are being considered."
1970,JohnnyCanada,"Mar 22, 2021 at 3:38 PM",3,Nice but ...,The game is great but it needs serious improvement to become a great training app. I train many times each week and I become bored by the music (but it's ok I listen to spotify instead). I used to do some boxing in club and a great improvement would to change the angle. I would be cool like in beat saber to have a 360 d. mode.

I‚Äôve not had any problems with timing etc and if this the start of home training it‚Äôs mouth watering what the future may hold!! Get on it, it‚Äôs hard, but brilliant..."
1974,Cat,"Dec 5, 2020 at 7:33 PM",4,"Good, but big rhythmic & tracking probs","I really like this app and I want to incorporate it into my daily routine, but it has some really frustrating tracking and timing issues. My controllers sometimes don't register hits, and the timing issues are things like the sound when you hit the ball comes often significantly after the beat (like a 16th note after), which is VERY disorienting and distracting, and sometimes you have to actually hit the ball way before the beat in order to have it register. When I stand there on the foot marks and hit exactly on the beat, the ball is often not right in front of me, or it isn't counted. I'm a professional drummer so I'm pretty good at stuff like hitting on the beat. When compared to something like Beat Saber, which has absolutely flawless tracking and hit recognition, this seems very lacking. It's DEEPLY demotivating to see yourself drop in the class ranks because the game just isn't registering your movements. I don't know how much things like individual arm length factor into this kind of thing. But if someone has long or short arms or edges themselves slightly off the foot prints, that shouldn't ruin their game. There should be leeway there. I have also noticed that it's a bigger problem on some songs than others.

There may be some tightening that the developers need to do, but I think a tutorial on how to align your body and where exactly in the field in front of you to aim your punches would be extremely helpful. You constantly lose your streak but there's no real visual or auditory information given about what you missed or did wrong. I think that's another thing they could take from the Beat Saber playbook. Someone else mentioned a tutorial on proper punching form in order to not hurt yourself, and that is a REALLY good idea.

So basically this app has a ton of potential but they really need to work on these tracking and rhythmic aspects to make it a bit more professional. Because more often than not I get annoyed and shut it off within 15 minutes."
1975,Chaoticgenius,"Mar 18, 2021 at 1:55 PM",4,A fan of BoxVR previously,"I was beginning to commit to box vr and my wife got me a quest 2 so I could be wireless and without headphones and I was stoked to see fitxr is the upgrade to BoxVR. In some ways it is an upgrade...and some not so much. The competitive nature and harder hits comes welcome rather than just cheesing stuff in BoxVR...but the dance stuff feels like it could have just been a different game and you could include more here. The songs from BoxVR also didn't remain and I miss some of them for sure. Also dunno if it's just my pc vs oculus but the frame rate is not the same either. 

That being said...a lot of my gripes come from what I'm used to and what I liked more. If you haven't played boxVR...this is as close as it gets and is pretty good for working out. Given that packs cost $10 to $20 bucks for more workouts...I would prefer more content per pack or throw in a ""featuring"" and give us some music we may know and certainly would want to get down to boxing or dancing with! If Beat Saber can come out with a 12 track LP pack for $20 bucks...I'm pretty sure FitXR can get some big names too. 

All in all this a quality game if you are looking to work out. I suggest it with a 4/5.

In the future I hope to see sales on content, new and familiar music, and gyms with friends so you can box and talk smack or at least feel like you are working out with a friend."
1976,Virvaen,"Mar 22, 2021 at 5:33 AM",3,Needs more options.,"I only play the boxing portion, because it's a really good workout. But for the price we pay, it's very disappointing that there aren't more options within each ""track"". They come as ""light"", ""moderate"" OR ""intense"". Similar games have always given you the option of all levels within each song (Rock Band, DDR, Beat Saber, etc....). Not having that option seems like a major over sight, or just lazy production. I rarely play the light sessions, which is kind of a waste. I also wish there was an option to increase the tempo/speed of the track for a more intense session."
1977,Oreo da Cute,"Mar 24, 2021 at 5:12 PM",3,The visuals on Quest 2 suck,"I think the boxVR looks decent on the Oculus Rift, but this Oculus Quest 2 version is a bit terrible to look at when you have a high resolution screen and there‚Äôs no way to adjust the settings. 

Most likely needs some optimization since games like beat saber and eleven table tennis have better resolution. 

I will say that the addition of multiplayer is fantastic and makes it much easier to cope with lower resolution as you‚Äôre not focused on that at the time. 

Overall great improvement but still need more work on optimizing the game to be visually appealing."
1978,Earle E Baruch,"Feb 17, 2021 at 2:02 PM",5,The Perfect COVID Crusher!,"I used to work out religiously. Been going to the gym since college and even at 60, still hitting 3 or 4 times a week. When COVID hit, I got very sedentary. Didn't want to go out and stopped exercising all together during the initial lockdown. After several months and putting on more weight then I wish to admit, I slow started exercising again but really could not find my grove. I missed the gym but didn't want to expose myself to that environment or workout in a mask.  Got my Occulus 2 several months ago as a distraction. A few weeks ago I saw the FitXR and decided to give it a try. I am absolutely hooked on the boxing. I finally found something fun today at home that gives me a good cardio workout and gets me fired up to do other exercises. I'm still working with the included packages and once I wear them out will probably buy more advanced onces. Thank you guys for a great app and fun workout."

I am new to this type VR exercises, it is different from the real one, because I do enjoy outdoors exercises more than indoor, 
doing exercises in the outdoor environment are more joyful and feel better, but I do not get the same enjoyment as inside of an indoor gym environments.
So may I suggest to have more outdoors environments if possible,  please. 
More trees, more colorful flowers, more birds, sun, or even rain or snowing too.
High in mountain,  or out in the wild or stand near the lake. 
Allow the user to pick different environments to do the exercise if possible. 
To have 5 to 10 different environments to choose  from will be great.

     No licensed music, so it‚Äôs all mediocre proprietary music.
 the environments are generic,
 Trainers, but not really. They have faces but they don‚Äôt say much  impaired to Supernatural trainers who you see and offer   dynamic support during the routines.

1997,J,"Mar 11, 2021 at 6:22 PM",4,Good but could be improved,"Good workout

Mostly what's bothering me is the long wait times. Is it due to downloading something? You cant cancel workout after it goes to the waiting mode. Wven if you're the only one in it. If it's loading something, it would be nice to see that visually. Also if workouts need to be downloaded from somewhere, have an option to do it in advance, so when you want to do that workout you don't need to wsit for it to load. 

UI/UX design needs to be more thoughtful, it seems it missing it completely. It hard to fine good workout when all of them are blasted in my face.

It would also be nice to see previous score of the workout to know you've played it, they all look so similar."
1998,Metatronic,"Feb 11, 2021 at 7:01 PM",5,Great of you put in the effort!,"I started playing this game only last week adding it into a new lockdown routine I've started (trying not get completely couch locked!). This app is honestly excellent, it does a really good job of simulating the movements of boxing and the combos, I cant speak for the dance classes as I only do the boxing but I've managed to lose 7 pounds already.
The only main issue with this game is it can suffer a little bit from ""wii syndrome"" where you can essentially stand still and hit the notes with minimal effort so its really down to the user if they are actually willing to really try. (No fault of the devs of course), but believe me if you really go for it and do it with the maximum effort you can it was absolutely have you puffing and sweating!"

There're more boxing choices than dancing, the dancing reminds me of my zumba fitness class at the gym. The songs are ok, not that great, but does the job of keeping you pumped up. Overall this game is a good cardio workout. The store packs are significantly harder and worth the add on charges.  Would recommend this app. In fact, I did recommend it to 4 of my friends, they all bought and we work out together. I hope the developers will make the multi player function available soon! 
P.s: I experienced twice the dancing got frozen at the middle of the workout. Quitting app and restarting the machine don't work. I ended up having to reinstall the app to fix the problem."
2004,MurphyMooCake,"Jan 16, 2021 at 7:33 AM",4,Needs more moves,"I've just bought this and so haven't tried every exercise yet however if there are only the limited punches and squats then for me more is needed to make the workout more beneficial

I am using this with wrist weights and so would really like more range in the exercises other than straight punch, upper cut and cross punches 

I would like lunge and punch with far reaching hits

Punch high (to simulate shoulder press) 

Punch low (to simulate tricep exercise)

Maybe an option to ride my arms in a rail like guitar hero so moving my arms in an arc and then holding them outright for example so again using wrist weights this way would exercise back, sides and waist

Lots could be done with this app to make it awesome and reading others reviews some great ideas have been suggested

I also read a few updates were due 28 days ago such as new environments etc but I haven't seen these

Good work developers but please add more movements and this will be great 5 star"
2005,Wayward,"Feb 2, 2021 at 10:44 PM",4,A great way to gamify your workout,"For me, its hard to convince myself to go and workout. Being in my mid 30s I know working out is becoming more and more important for my daily health. Problem is, I lack the want to acutally workout. This is where thisn game comes in. Simulating a fun shadow boxing class and putting a competitive spin on every class/lesson really helps me WANT to workout. I want to strap in and do better than the rest in my class. I want to get my sweat on and see those calories burn. The music is serviceable, not stuff I'd listen to outside of this game...but they do the job. They keep me pumped up and keep me on rhythm as I punch my way through each class. A thirty minute session has me plenty winded and plenty sweaty and there are harder modes for me to tackle as I get used to the earlier classes. If you like getting your heart rate up from games like Beat Saber, then this should be a must buy for all folks who are trying to gt a little more out of their VR, other thelan just gaming."
2006,Ovi,"Mar 15, 2021 at 9:02 AM",5,Amazing workout,Brings out the competitive side of me. 20 mins of this became my morning workout routine
2007,Sandra,"Mar 8, 2021 at 8:28 AM",5,FitXR New User,I‚Äôm absolutely loving this. Brilliant variety and suitable for different levels of fitness. Would totally recommend this.
2008,ABC123TC,"Jan 25, 2021 at 1:45 PM",5,A Genuine Game-Changer,"It‚Äôs important to highlight that this game completely revamped at the end of 2020, so most of these reviews are extremely outdated.

This game is superb. I have only tried the boxing, but I‚Äôve integrated it into my daily routine and now do it every day now before work. It is truly exceptional. There is no other app in the oculus store like it.

The sky park arena was only added a few weeks ago and is exceptional - the shining sun is exactly what I need to motivate me first thing in the morning! 

Beat Saber is more polished, but FitXR will get there soon. This is far more focussed on fitness than Beat Saber. It has more to add, but that‚Äôs not stopping me rate it 5 stars for all the great stuff you can do right now.


I would love to see:
- more workouts: Beat Sabre has several difficulty levels for different songs. I appreciate that a single workout in this app includes multiple songs, but it does feel unreasonable to have to pay another $10 for a new pack of four workouts. It only comes with a few intense workout by default. The songs are surprisingly good but it would be nice to have some popular songs or even custom tracks like Beat Saber (I would happily pay $10 for an Imagine Dragons pack like you can there). What you get is great but it needs more.

- live multiplier: Currently they are only recordings of other people. Would be great to play with real people live to make it feel like a real class, and also be able to workout live with friends.

- high scores in-game: compete with your past score and friends‚Äô scores.

- more environments: I only started playing recently and the Sky Park makes this app great for me. More like that would be great. (sunset on a beach, more nature, more bright environments). VR is a great escapism and exercising in beautiful bright daylight is what I come here for.

- clearer home screen: All workouts look the same in the menu. Just the photo of the trainer and a vague name. Definitely need better descriptions (and importantly to see if played before and how many times, to quickly tell which is which).

- better tutorial. We need to be told how to punch for extended periods without hurting ourselves, how to squat perfectly, etc.


Keep up the great work!"
2009,Louis,"Feb 28, 2021 at 6:20 PM",5,Brilliant for a workout,What a fantastic work out you get and if your unfit like myself I would start easy and work yourself up as you will feel the aches and pains the next dayüòÄüòÄ

2013,Liselle,"Jan 25, 2021 at 1:35 AM",5,Great daily workout,"FitXR has been my daily go-to VR workout every day since I got my Quest 2 at the beginning of December. The experience is awesome. It plays well, very intuitive, sleek design.

There is room to make it even BETTER and I know the community has offered great suggestions already, like fixing the calorie counter and enabling the option to play with friends specifically.

Can't wait to see what the future brings!"
2014,Lifted567,"Jan 9, 2021 at 5:03 AM",3,I want to give it more stars....,"I want to give this app five stars so bad because I can see the potential but it misses the mark just a bit. The app is great if you want to get a good workout in you will definitely burn some calories and the time flies by fast. 

There are some cons with this game as far as the accuracy and the streaks you can obtain. I thought that the recent updates would help with this butÔøº it seems to not have made much of a difference. 
I think the developers can take a page out of Beat Sabers book on how to make this better for users. 

Also some of the combinations they throw at you are impossible to complete while keeping good form. I practice boxing and kickboxing 3 to 4 times a week in a fight gym so yes I do know what I‚Äôm talking about. Throwing an uppercut, hook, uppercut and cross with only the rear hand within a few seconds is impossible unless you throw them short and not far from your body. 
 
Form is important to not injure yourself and why not try to emulate a real class? If you look around at the other users while playing most don‚Äôt even keep their hands up for most of the game. Would help if the developers received combos from professional fighters and trainers that actually know how it should flow."
2015,Asia,"Feb 20, 2021 at 5:45 PM",4,Good workout,"Fitxr is by far the most used thing on my Quest now. I've finally established a workout routine over the last month or so, and I feel healthier and in better shape. I like how I can easily fit neat little 10 or 15 minute workouts during my day. 

I havent really been able to get into the dance routines too much. It feels clumsy, and being a guy I guess I feel a bit goofy doing it. I can see why other people would be into it though. It does feel like more of a full body workout, even if I'm not especially graceful going through the motions.

One thing I dont like and hope gets improved is the calorie count. When I first started on light workouts, it would show I burned 200-300 kcal during a 10 minute workout. It seemed a bit high. Now I'm doing much more intensive and longer workouts and it will show that I'm only doing.50 or 60 kcal. A more accurate count would help me adjust my diet better.

Overall, It's a great program and I highly recommend it."
2016,Babae,"Mar 7, 2021 at 9:06 PM",4,A must have!,"It‚Äôll get you huffing and pouring sweat. Great workouts. I have gravitated more towards the boxing. Never realized I would love to box so much till this app!! My only thing is the music is not my ‚Äújam‚Äù, I guess it‚Äôs because I am a Gen X and I love my 80s and 90s. Also... no warm up stretching. Overall all this app is pretty good especially for introverts or people that hate crowds like me. I fukn hate gyms too. Have a nice day :)"
2017,Saxon1337,"Mar 7, 2021 at 11:58 AM",4,Good work out,I use this every 2nd day for 40mins. Its a great and fun workout. I have 3 kids so its better then going to the gym. The only thing id like to see is how many punches you made and how many squats you done at the end of the round. Also for the day and week and month. Id like to keep track of that stuff.
2018,Moosical,"Feb 12, 2021 at 5:51 AM",4,Pretty happy with this... But...,"I'm pretty happy with it.  Eventually I will do this everyday but right now just a little too busy with other stuff...  I feel like I get a good workout in... Certainly gets my blood pumping.  üôÇ 

My biggest request is now that hand tracking is a thing on the quest, please make that work with this!  I'd much rather not have to hold the controller for my workout... That would be awesome to be able to put down the controllers and just make a fist when I'm boxing!

Thank you!!"

Well worth the money
It has great features including a chance to either do it on your own or play with others

Would have given 5 stars but, music a bit repetitive AND I wish you could invite friends like Beat Sabre etc... better work out than Beat Sabre though and I LOVE the fact it‚Äôs easier to keep on track as it‚Äôs definitely a boxing workout 
Calorie tracking is a bit optimistic however as when wearing my Apple Watch, calories tracked are in fact about half, 100 calories per 10 minutes is more accurate for me!
Also pause button a bit sensitive which is annoying when you‚Äôre in ‚Äòthe zone‚Äô all in all tho, brilliant game very addictive and probably my favourite on the VR ( definitely need anti fog cloth!) just saying ü§£"

2031,PurplePuff,"Feb 5, 2021 at 5:34 AM",5,Its what I was looking for.,"I honestly bought the Oculus quest for the purpose of working out. Between Beat Saber and FitXR, I am not disappointed. I've gotten better over the last month at sticking with a workout and each time I log on, I workout just a little longer. 

A couple things that don't knock the score down for me, I wish they had some hit songs to workout too. Also, I struggle some with hitting in the boxing, maybe a little extra instruction would be great to help understand how to fix my hits.

Other than those 2 things, really I enjoy this a lot. I  haven't mentioned the dance yet. Its fun, but I prefer boxing. It is just a little more intense."
2032,Niluja,"Feb 5, 2021 at 10:33 PM",2,BoxVR is better,"Why ? 
- In FitXR, most of the workouts are during only 10-15min, there's no continuation between sessions and it breaks the rhythm. It's impossible to create playlists, weird choice... I prefer long workouts of BoxVR (30-45min)
- Music synchronization with punchs is good in BoxVR, not in FitXR
- Less workouts (or pay 10$ x6 to get more)
I go back to BoxVR on PS4, just please dont update it to FitXR"
2033,Brett Steele,"Mar 7, 2021 at 6:52 PM",2,...How...do you scrue this up,So not gonna lie I want a refund but I'm far past that point. For months I was using this to lose weight. Did every single boxing course and saw minimal effects. Which was weird cuz I'd burn 2200 to 2500 calories in some sessions. Then occulus move came out. And showed I was really burning like 500. Followed by a simple google search you cant burn that many calories shadowboxing. HOW DO YOU HAVE INACCURATE CALORIES BURNED?! That's a CORE of you're game. I feel like I wasted money and along of time. You had ONE job fit xr...one.
2034,Bluebelle,"Jan 25, 2021 at 7:45 PM",5,Loving this,"Read some of the other reviews... I'm not technically knowledgeable . Just wanted something that would allow me to workout, hopefully improving from being totally unfit after a year in lockdown.

It certainly does that.  I LOVE IT. I can slowly build up my duration and intensity and use a short low intensity dance as warm up. I put my whole self into these  punches and even after 3 minutes can feel the benefits of increased cardiovascular function.

I've been recommending this app to friends.  Totally worth it."
2035,Persil_,"Feb 15, 2021 at 6:31 PM",4,Its a good app,"I am enjoying it mostly, the dance classes are really making me sweat 
However, i am struggling with the boxing classes a little - is there a way to adjust the height settings? My biggest problem is that I am having to hold my controllers at my shoulder height, not at my chest, to hit the spots. Not only is this very difficult to actually hit the angled ones but I'm also not getting any workout from it, other than some aching shoulders. Am I just not seeing how to change the height settings?"
2036,Jason,"Mar 5, 2021 at 4:36 PM",3,"Not bad, not great",Little annoyances keep this from being a go-to fitness app. The fact the activity filters constantly reset and the poor tracking make it a pretty frustrating experience.    I'd also love the ability to turn off the coach audio if they're just going to keep repeating the same couple of phrases. I'm sure it will get better as it goes along but for now I'll stick with Supernatural.
2037,GrizzlyMagnum,"Feb 2, 2021 at 2:32 PM",5,Most of my family use it.,"Comfort says moderate but I would say its comfortable.

My girlfriend loves to get a workout dancing.
I absolutely love the boxing (especially when it has a good track to go with it).

Brief list of pros and cons.
(could easily be a longer list).

Pros -

- after doing 2 or 3 classes  around 4 days per week, I felt my cardio improve even in the first week. (I have ALWAYS avoid cardio workouts and gass out really quickly) 

- Great, steady frame rate allows for no nausea.

- Nice looking environments.

- Lots of feedback makes for a very fun experience (and a feeling of shame when you loose your explosive chain). ü§£

Cons -
(more like suggestions/requests as there is not much to complain about. It honestly does everything you would expect from this kind of app).

- More environments! 
  There needs to be more of them.
  A change of scenery really changes the mood     and everyone has there own idea of a 'happy  place' or somewhere that would get there blood pumping.
It makes a big difference, especially if you are using the app often, this subtle change can postpone feelings of boredom.

- I honestly think someone (who isn't a superhuman) needs to play through these songs and give them a new rating.

I have been getting into a right mess with the intermediate classes (some of them really should be changed to intense)
One of the 3 min intense sessions I tried felt much more like a 'light' session too.

It kind of wears on your patience when you have to look so hard for 'just the right' music and intensity given that some of the 'Rock' sounds more like a taylor swift  song and some of the intensity tags should be swapped

- It would be helpful if your play history included the titles of what you played.


Regardless. Excellent app, 'does what it says on the tin'.

If your looking for a fitness app. There's not much reason to not go for this."
2038,Cubuletz,"Feb 2, 2021 at 10:09 AM",5,Mi first VR experience,"Before buying FitXr I was looking on a entire list of fitness games better rated than this one and I can tell I have no regrets I bought this. Every morning is draining my energy and squeeze the water out of my body on intense 20 mins sessions. If you want to loose weight even if you want to improve your general condition, take it. I declare myself completely satisfied even some of the sessions are sometimes a bit out of the sync (music vs punch rhythm ).Waiting for more intense sessions!"

2040,Ellie,"Feb 2, 2021 at 8:47 PM",5,I love it,"I played BoxVR in the past so when I bought this I was pretty sure the boxing part would be great (and it is).

2045,Gingermen,"Feb 2, 2021 at 11:23 AM",5,Great cardio workout,"FitXR has been transformative. It goes without saying you get out of it what you put in and I have found lost muscles coming alive, upper body strengthening and high levels of sweat. Over the course of a few weeks I have increased both intensity and time spent in FitXR classes with great results.

The programme offers a range of classes catering to ability and musical taste with a good bit of gamification to nudge you to go even further.

I would like to see leaderboards (weekly and monthly) and the ability to see which classes (you can access) that you haven‚Äôt done or not done as many times. There is a lot of variety but further improvements to choosing classes and frequency you have chosen classes would be helpful (but that may just be of interest to me!)

All in all this is a great experience and great value so long as you put in the time and effort, as with any exercise."

I feel healthier and my fitness is clearly going up based on the time I can now spend in there exercising on higher difficult settings.

The one thing I NEED to beg the developers for is a way to mute their instructors as every time they tell me how well I‚Äôm doing it makes me miss my streak and they are driving me crazy. Please, please, please just give me a ‚Äòshut up talking to me while I exercise‚Äô option.

I do the boxercise rather than the dancing, and because i've got a dodgy knee, I duck and weave to avoid the obstacles rather than squat. After 20 minutes (Top Of The World being my fave), I'm drenched with sweat and out of breath. NOTES TO DEVS: Pretty sure there's a dodgy ball around 4 minutes in, which ruins my streak every time. Or maybe I've just got a block with it. Idea for future dev: remember how when Eliud Kipchoge ran the 2 hour marathon, they projected laser onto the road to show him the required pace... could you do that in the game to show progress against your record score? Always trying to beat the record score, but knowing where you're is more of a hunch currently!"

My BIGGEST pet peeve / beef with the system is the fact that the ""A"" or ""X"" buttons remain LIVE during the workout - since they're so easy to hit inadvertently, the session pauses in mid-punch, and you lose a streak or hit. Some of the sessions are also not well coordinated to the music, which can be annoying. My last feedback is about the Calorie consumption estimates - which seem to be on the high side - is there any plan to integrate BT heartrate monitors to the system ? 

What about Vertical ""jump over"" obstacles ? That might be a fun thing to incorporate into the workout. Lean left / right / duck gets old after a while...

Keep up the great stuff, team!

Anyway, its really really fun..."

If you want to work out in vr, this is it!

Pro's:
1. Music and voice
2. the new outside stage
3. The timing of the boxing ü•ä
4. Level's of hardness

What should be fixed in next update:
1.the update fixed most but still sometimes missing my move.
2. Add defense with both arms in the sides.
3.add dlc known music like beat saber i would pay.
4. Add dlc with more kinds of fit games (more then dance or boxing)
5. Fix the calories count.. no one believes that ;) cut it in half.

Again.. if you want to  sweat, this game is for you!"

I've bought three because I was getting very bored with the same five longer duration workouts. When you buy an expansion pack of four, typically only one (maybe two) of those is worth playing repeatedly I've learned. I don't know why they can't sell them individually. Some workouts have movements that have no correlation the music. The 'Warm-Up' on the Extreme Pack for example: you're literally swinging off beat at times. I just tried the Absolute Box pack - 'Comma Get It' workout. For starters, the music is not electronic - that's Hip-Hop. The real issue is it includes squats that literally no person has time to do. It wants you to do vertical and then side and then vertical squats within literally a second and the come up for hooks. I assume they didn't try this workout before releasing? I thought maybe I was just trying too hard to complete a proper squat, and then I looked at the other figures/people around me and they are literally staying in a squat position during the rapid squat portions and punching from there to get the hits. It is absurd!? The original concept of this game was super fun, but now with only two workout environments and the expansion packs being a mess, I can't recommend anyone get this until their development team gets it together. It gets boring when you want to workout with this daily. You can't release workouts that maybe a computer generated that are physically impossible for actual people at home. Players are going to end up getting hurt."

It never fails to give me a wonderful workout, and after 3 weeks I can already see and feel the difference in my body. However the in-game commentary is ridiculous. It's always the same words, it always feels like they come up randomly, and there is no real feedback. Feedback like telling me to slow down, or to help me improve is far more valuable than the same gobbledygook every single game.

I don't get the stats that I want - for example, he's my average force per ball increasing ball over time? What about average calories burned per day? How about average game time?

The first two weeks were very painful and I was sore in every muscle in my body every day. But now, doing squats and boxing for 30 minutes is a breeze. So my fitness progress has been very visible and now I'm pushing my limits every day.

There are quite a few features missing, but every update seems to be very substantial and we're still only on v1.0 so I hope to see lots of the feature requests to the devolpers being incorporated for a more wholesome experience.

Will you be annoyed by the missing features, bugs or sometimes missed streaks due to badly placed pause buttons on Quest 2? Yes. But take the rage out on the next good streak and you'll feel highly rewarded.

The overall experience has been joyful, my fitness is getting better every day and I look forward to each game session. Enjoy!"

2077,Eric,"Jan 16, 2021 at 6:38 AM",3,Great start for long term habit,"WILL UPDATE TO 5 STAR WHEN (see below)

A great start at long term workout routine. This earns its three stars for being a solid workout. I‚Äôve encountered no bugs or glitches - it plays great (which is more than can be said for other games on the platform)! The workouts are simple but energetic, and I get a great workout each time! Definitely think about getting a silicone cover to keep the foam head pad dry! 

While it‚Äôs a blast to play initially, it becomes repetitive quickly. I found myself losing motivation after a week of play.  

Here‚Äôs what I think FitXR still needs:

4 STAR: more variety 

Boxing has jabs, uppercuts and hooks, and sprinkles in dodges/squats from time to time. Can we get some more things to do? How about a long squat? Maybe some arm circles? Other simple body movements? I‚Äôd go nuts for a ‚Äúnext 10 seconds punch as fast and hard as you can‚Äù mode right in the middle of the workout. Like a real know the punching bag out kinda thing. 

5 STAR: I wanna play with my friends!

So the group play is actually super motivating. You get to play with faceless other players and compete against them in your session. How about a friends match? Would be super cool to play and chat with friends in a group workout rather than strangers over the internet. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this is a good game. But I‚Äôd like to see more variety to the workouts and some friends play before I would say I‚Äôm a raving fan."

They took away features like creating a playlist, the DLC is a little overpriced, BUT - they are continuing to update the app AND one Facebook account can create multiple profiles in the app, and it will run in two headsets/two FitXR profiles/one account.

Almost any app that lets my wife and I play without requiring two separate Facebook accounts and two app purchases deserves at least three stars. It's a good workout as well, so four stars. Hope they keep working on it to push it to a five star app."

It's well worth the money in my opinion and the free content is more then enough for beginners. after 3 days of using the game the pain of my muscles all over it hurts it was like being at the gym again but in my home so I decided to do more intense classes and bought the all body package and it feels great after each class I do every day so I hope this helps anyone and given them an idea.

You see the mentality problem?  I expected more on fitXR. I don't like that business model. 
Anyway, not many song, and I don't care to dance hip hop and the dances are lame anyway. Not even really sync to the music. The multiplayer is a joke. There's no personalisation. You can't make a work out. You can't add songs. No gamification. It is really not a nice experience imo."

I then decided to take the advise of people and use my own music through bluetooth and play.  This has helped make it more interesting.  I love the workouts but please reinstate the BoxVR legacy levels and/or make some additional content.  I might buy the ultimate pack, but still feel for the game to get above 4 stars more free variety needs to be added especially for medium and intense workouts.  No reason not to have more 15 min to 30 minute workouts."

2086,Jay,10/1/2002 0:00,4,So much potential (update: better),"I do enjoy playing the game and it builds up a sweat, but it also infuriates me sometimes.

The tutorials should also be more comprehensive. Importantly, there is no tutorial on how to punch correctly. This seems like a dangerous oversight to make, should people start punching incorrectly and wrecking themselves in the process. Not to mention that using a correct form utilizes the whole body and would also result in a better workout. Also, I'm still not sure how the game wants me to block, as it frequently decides that my blocking was not successful ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The sounds that the game makes are inconsistent (sound for hitting a streak and missing a beat are the same) and finishing a streak is realitively high and very demotivating if it resets because of the game not recognizing your punch or block correctly.

Also, I would love to have more customization options (like modifying the time in-between songs, currently the delay feels too long and I lose my groove) and workout details (what songs are included in a workout, what is the difficulty level of the workout and how many squats/obstacles does the workout contain).

Making your own playlist seems like a tedious job as well, it takes several seconds to play a song.

Overall, this experience leaves me sad more often than happy. But the songs and the sweaty workouts are what keep me coming back. I wish that at least some of these issues will get fixed and the game will improve over time ü•ä



Update:
FitXR is a definite improvement over BoxVR and it has addressed some of the issues I had with the game (there's a tutorial, the time between songs is much shorter and fluid, plus the game is more polished overall)

One grip that I still have is that the game doesn't always recognize my movement correctly. This is very demotivating when I know I have done the movement correctly and will lose the streak. This is exacerbated by the online game element, where those ""mistakes"" will drop you down in the rankings. This may sound like a petty complaint, but if the game doesn't allow me to turn off such demotivating features, it should get it right!"

I have been super busy and had given my original quest to my friend, but recently got a quest 2 and was looking forward to getting back to my workout routine. Where are the cool environments and why do I have to listen to a trainer the whole time? I loved BoxVR and I'm sure it needed some tweaking but this feels really different and not enjoyable. Can I revert to the previous version somehow? I bought boxvr on steam years ago for my rift cv1 and also here for quest. I saw a post on reddit responding to similar feedback but that was months ago and it looks like none of it was acted on.

Not trying to be harsh it's just a bummer to open up a game you bought and loved to find something completely different. Most the changes are in things removed not improved. I wouldn't have kept this past the refund period.

2094,Aidin,"Dec 4, 2020 at 9:04 PM",4,"Really good, training is fun again","Let me start by saying, I used to workout quite a lot. Then I became a bit lazy and didn't enjoy training. I had to force myself. But with this, I actually enjoy it, and what is great is that time flies!

My normal routine is about 40 min weight lifting and then 30 minutes of FitXR. I get sweaty all over and tired but it feels great and fun. 

However great it is, I think it falls short in 2 areas though (I am comparing to Hitstream):
1. The hitbox of the boxes feels to small, the precision need to be right on for it to register a hit and I often miss even though I feel it was pretty much spot on. I don't have this problem in hitstream (or any other rythm games). Improve the hitbox please.

2. The squats are a bit to ""high"" (you don't need to squat properly) and some squats need to be done very hasty in order to not miss the beats right after. This is actually something I think Hitstream does excellenty. I really encourage the developer to go check Hitstream out (especially the squat mechanic). This issue is mainly with the side squats, the front squats are fine, should only be a bit lower. 

Oh, and besides. I feel like the calories burnt estimation is very exaggerated. No way in hell I burn 1000 kcal after 30 min workout. I think it's about 3 or 4 times to high. 

Tldr: Great game for workout, fun. Some small improvements possible. Fix those and it will be 5 stars right away."

Most of the punches are not set correctly to the rhythm of the song. 

As a fan of all music I can say that there are some songs that you just shouldn‚Äôt workout to, and this game includes alot of those songs. The music needs a big overhaul and maybe some licensing deals with some familiar artists. 

The group workouts are nearly impossible to get 1st place because there are always multiple people swinging the controller like a sword rather than a boxing glove. So if you are competitive it can be frustrating to look over and see someone doesn‚Äôt even bother to change their stance and is probably sitting.

What about hiring other instructors who can also provide choreographies for those born before 2000? Since the quest 2 made vr available to less tech-savy people, a new group of users is there and hungry for games. Users who have good money. What about providing experiences that can be fully enjoyable also for not-so-young VR users? The exercises included are very good.

2122,MarDuff,"Feb 9, 2021 at 5:29 PM",4,A good workout,"I really enjoy the boxing sessions. The virtual trainees are encouraging and it's fun to exercise with them. In my opinion I prefer the solo sessions.

The outdoor environment in this game is my preference, I would definitely like to have more outdoor environments.

Since I'm not good with the rhythmic of my moves, I have difficulties in the dance workout sessions, but the shortest and easiest one is ok for me.

So make you move after our before a work day, this game is a must."
2123,Carlos,"Jan 14, 2021 at 7:07 AM",3,"Good game, broken tracking?","It makes you sweat, and is actually fun. But there are 2 concerns.

1) tracking of the ""jab"" punch is broken. It rarely sees my jab as a hit. I have to either hammer punch or hook punch for it to count towards a streak. Please fix this major issue.

2) I should be able to play live against friends. Working out at the same time together would make this game a must but for every oculus owner."

One area of improvement is there should be a ranking system to compare highscores with friends to keep the game challenging and interesting. Also there should be a pause with a timer for 30 min + session just long enough to let us drink some water."

Not only is it fun, but it gives you a great workout. I wish it would incorporate elbows, knees and kicks. But... I seriously enjoy this game and after playing for about 20 minutes over the weekend I am pretty sore! Thanks for waking up some muscles!"
2128,timonfitz,"Feb 12, 2021 at 3:23 AM",3,Not as bad as I thought,"Normally I don't write reviews much except in cases where I feel like I have some input not in other reviews. First of all I used BoxVR almost daily for 3 or 4 months when my gym was closed but hadn't been on it since the update. I was looking at other apps and was reading the mostly bad reviews for FitXR thinking based on reviews there is no way I would pay for that. Of course then I realized that it had replaced my BoxVR.  For developers to switch an app that I already paid for with another almost completely different app that I didn't pay for or agree to is beyond shady. The canned responses from the developers on the reviews seem to show no concern at all or address this issue. To be honest what they did as far as completely removing a paid app and replacing it with another similar app and then calling it an update is almost completely unheard of and would be a horrible practice for reputable developers to do. They can take whatever input they want to try and improve FitXR. But unless they reconcile what they did to consumers who bought BoxVR I would fully support kicking them off Oculus store approved apps altogether and at the very least will not drop another dime on anything these developers have any part in. Again, I haven't seen any comments from the developers that have addressed the slightly unethical complete switching of a platform of a game and calling it an update. But since I already paid for something I will continue to use.

So for the actual FitXR. I've used it for a few days so haven't got the full feel of all the different features yet. I liked BoxVR better for various reasons because I'm doing it solely for exercise. The arcade feel of the whole thing is very busy on the screen and I would like to be able to turn off the explosions for sure. It's very distracting. I do actually like that you can turn off squats for individual classes instead of just sorting classes by no squats. It would be nice if you could turn them off mid session. I do like that you can pause and resume if you need to stop for some reason. BoxVR you could only restart. Overall I don't mind the gloves thing because the hands seem to line up better. If the gloves weren't calibrated properly before it changed the angle and gave you lower score. I don't think that it is as good as BoxVR but I still think it's doable for a workout. The music sucks but that's because it's like a fitness class at gym and their music also is not my style. The developer issues aside I think the app in its current state is not worth the money. But the actual play of it is not as bad as some reviews indicate and I'll continue to throw it into my workout routine"
2129,Mihaly Bak,"Feb 23, 2021 at 10:45 AM",4,Too small hit targets,"I really like the exercise part of the game, however it fells like the hit targets in the box exercises are ridiculously small. It gets really annoying when you miss them. For a training game it feels unnecessarily difficult"

2138,Koz,"Jan 10, 2021 at 10:38 PM",5,"Awesome, as I hear in the game","This is exactly why I bought an Oculus and what I expected from a fitness app. I bought it ten days ago and use it every day. I only do box sessions - from 20 minutes to 50 a day - and end up tired each time, needing a shower. It seems also that the benefit is already visible but I have to confirm."
2139,ArmyWall,"Mar 8, 2021 at 9:19 AM",4,So many of these games,"There are just so many of these types of games, but they all seem to have that one thing that makes them just a little different.  I like the boxing modes a little better."
2140,Amy,"Feb 6, 2021 at 3:03 PM",4,This has become my daily workout,"I really love this ap. It isn't fancy. It doesn't need to be. I'm not a fitness buff but I'm not a total couch potato either and after 15 minutes of this I'm sweating and DONE! I use it as a daily workout. So does my husband and my mom. I have two recommendations to make it 5 stars. The first world be the ability to thumbs down a workout. For the most part the music is decent but there have been several times I chose a workout that has music that doesn't get me excited to work out (or even worse there have been a couple that sounds like Celine Dion singing Christian rock)... And I don't remember what it's called so I pick it again on another day. So pretty much the opposite of a favorite. Also, I'd like to see the favorite and thumbs down on the main page as I scroll through and pick my daily sessions.

The next change I'd love would be the ability to play offline. It doesn't have to be all of the workouts but our internet is pretty questionable sometimes so I have missed quite a few days because it never loads. Then I have to play thrill of the fight and those guys are creepy.

All that being said... If you are fit this is a great warm up. If you are less than fit this will kick your butt. Highly recommend."
2141,MistyGray,"Feb 6, 2021 at 7:19 AM",4,Love this,"During the pandemic most of us have put on  few extra pounds...I wanted to go to the gym, but they were closed I purchased the oculus and I enjoy my workout every night. I challenge myself , I like the music choices. But I agree with others some of the punches are not in tune with the music, I really love the squat , I don't like the low, workout when 8 took boxing we did squats and punched ducks too but I don't recall ever being that low thats not good on the lower back  but I enjout coming in and boxing"

I was put off buying it for so long due to the lowish rating. It's now the first app I go to when I turn on my headset and is used daily. Unfortunately as most have already said it's not multiplayer yet ( FitXR have said this is now in development ) however you get to compete against 6  ghosts  of other FitXR players from their past efforts. There's nothing finer than watching that explosive streak rise but devastating when you lose it. I can't comment on the dancing, I've tried twice but quit as soon as I have to move. Buy it, be prepared to sweat and enjoy."

It is a great workout that is fun and it is familiar to me as I used to box years ago. I love how they push you and that you can go into a class session with other players and battle to move up in rank, this definitely helps me push myself. I only had the game for a week and I was working out with other players and I ended up working my way up to second place and staying there for the first half of the session and on the back half I seen that I was close to first place and pushed myself as the person in first begin to tire and I took the lead and finished first place. I love everything about the game/workout and so it is an easy 5 star rating for me."

The other fitness games including rhythm games don‚Äôt come even close to this level of workout.

It can get boring at times but I find that periodically switching between box and dancing is enough to kill the routine.

The basic soundtrack is more than decent, I haven‚Äôt bought the extra tracks yet, but might consider them in the future.

It lacks true multiplayer, you can take group classes but that‚Äôs it. No big deal though.

A must have for anyone interested in VR fitness"

If you want to feel like you're in a futuristic gym with awesome graphics, great workout program you need to try this app. You  won't regret it. 
To the developers thank you thank you thank you... thanks for the awesome update"
2155,Saintknight,10/19/2002 0:00,5,Been training in boxing gyms,"Before Covid I attended boxing classes regularly to lose weight whenever I needed to. For a person that already has a grasp on form with stance and punching you‚Äôll be fine. For a beginner to boxing throwing punches with poor form will be problematic. However, if your just looking for a work out to move your arms, squat, and dodge this is your game. It has the potential to be better than beat saber for a lot of people. 

What would make the game better would be teaching form. Teaching a person to move from left to right using their feet is an improvement. There should also be a 360 mode forcing a person to pivot. More dynamic motions should be added like pivot into a sway then uppercut. Lastly to add old school music, latin music, and hip hop instrumental to the game would make a lot more boxers feel right at home."

2158,Jen Jones,"Feb 3, 2021 at 8:52 PM",4,"Fun Workout, but music needs improvement","The workouts are engaging and make you want to come back and box the next day.  Not a huge fan of the dance workouts even though I love to dance, but maybe I need to give it a few more tries before I make that conclusion.  I have boxed quite a bit and have a boxing bag at home.  I find myself using fitXR a few times a week instead of the boxing bag as much.  I use other workout apps on Oculus 2 as well and find that I enjoy the workouts more when there is a better selection of music.  I would be willing to pay for an upgrade to have recognizable music selections.  I would definitely recommend this anyone who likes to box.  Looking forward to seeing what else FitXR offers in the future.  I think this is a great start!"
2159,Rusty,"Feb 3, 2021 at 6:31 PM",4,Pretty good but.....,"It's a pretty good work out overall but calorie counts are waaaaaaay out. I competed a 17 minute workout and FitXR says I burnt 680 calories!  The built in Oculus Move app has the same workout tracked at 120 calories.

Some of the workouts are not really synced very well with the music either. Although some are quite good. It's a mixed bag.

Also would be good if it integrated with other fitness apps, i.e. Samsung Health for me.

Another annoyance is you don't seem to be able to delete favourite workouts without first doing the workout again and then deselecting it at the end. You should be able to do this from the main menu.

Music packs are too expensive as well.  I know Beat Saber charge a fortune as well but these are not good value to me.

Pretty good overall though. I used the old BoxVR app on Oculus Rift and it's improved massively from that in most areas."

I can tell a difference already in my body and energy. Only flaw I suppose is some of the songs the best doesn‚Äôt match to the hits so it throws you off and when your on a streak it starts you back at 1 bc they had a glitch. That‚Äôs upsetting. Overall though I love this!!!!
2161,Pranks,"Jan 28, 2021 at 4:16 AM",5,Love the app,This is a great calorie burner. I do wish that developers make longer workouts and add more music. I would love to see something longer than 20 minutes.
2162,Billy Bob,"Jan 6, 2021 at 5:18 PM",5,Great,"You don't get a lot with the basic game. If it was free it would make more sense and is be willing to drown 50 more dollars into the extras but at 30 for the base game I expect more content. 

As for gameplay it's smooth but some of the books and uppercuts are so hard to get the combo on that you end up expending way more energy than you should. It's really hard to keep the combos going. Since I'm usually top 3 in my class and miss a bunch I'm assuming I'm not the only one. 

Other than that it's great fun. The dancing is laid back and fun and it's a good workout. 

Taking off 1 point for tracking which seems a bit sub par on the quest 2 and 1 point for so little content in a 30 dollar game and then pricing all future content at 10 dollars a pop. They are following workout video pricing not video game pricing

All together this app seems severely limited in even the simplest options. Already bought a dlc pack so loathed to return the game since I can't return the dlc but Def would avoid until/if they add the simplest features like working out to specific in game track. If you add this simple feature I will adjust this review. Until then would recommend synth riders since it has this, similar movements, better gameplay and better style and visuals."

For some reason, my jab style punches have gone down to almost the lowest possible force, even when I swing as hard as possible. As a competitive person, this bothers me. I used to be towards the top and now I am always at the bottom. I loved the competitive features but they keep making the game worse with issues every time they update. Please fix!"

When I contacted the developers before the 2 hour refund period elapsed they claimed a hot fix will be released within a week but that never happened or if it did in the background then it didn't fix the issue.

So to keep workouts fun for a longer period of time, you have to pay ‚Ç¨30 + ‚Ç¨10 (and maybe an additional ‚Ç¨10). Could be a 4- or even a 5-star rating if they would add more free classes."

2183,DPCharly,"Jan 3, 2021 at 10:53 PM",5,I kinda understand the hate. Not really:,"Quick: it‚Äôs good, get it. But read this too why. 

I kinda understand the hate, maybe not, probably because I didn‚Äôt play BoxVR... I almost didn‚Äôt buy this because of the reviews. Also, to be honest, the whole thing of changing the name (too on the nose) and the trailer/art that is so girly turned me off. The developers or the marketing guys/gals behind it are not making themselves a favor. Maybe they think that the female market is more abundant and the name BoxVR it was turning them girls off. It has to be a medium so you can capture both. 

Finally I got it to see what‚Äôs up. And I got it because I watched an actual gameplay in YouTube that didn‚Äôt look  like that revolting dancish trailer they put together up (toxic masculinity! Ha!). ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna dance!‚Äù I said to myself. And this has dance too, but if you wanna sweat and do some really intense boxing moves without the pvp ego in the middle, this one will do the trick, as you can separate filter them in the menu. 

They can do a better job separating objectives. Now is all a jumble inside, mixing dancing, choreographies and boxing routines. Is confusing. And upsetting probably to previous BoxVR users. If they separate clearly in the menus, and have enough exercises for each of them, the app is going to take off. Because it shines when you are doing the actual routine. It‚Äôs clear, you know what to do with the precise instructions, and it can be intensive, and will make you lose some calories right away, if you do it with heart. Punching or dancing, whatever rocks your world. 

Still, 5 stars. More like 4.9, ha! But please, fix that. Clearly separate modalities, and do a better job marketing it (don‚Äôt exclude your first customers!). We suspect that the first times business based decisions are taken, is with the good in mind. But when the flaws are being pointed out many times and not corrected once and once again, is marginalizing."

I'm exhausted after  30 minutes of doing a boxing workout.

I do this on a regular basis since it's much more fun than going on the stationary bike. I'm pretty sure the calories burnt per minute are similar if not higher than the bike.

2188,SlipSlot,"Jan 30, 2021 at 10:45 PM",4,Opium Pulses Review,"Fitness games are in a weird space with VR, on one hand, they seem to make little sense, being comfortable while working out is important for persistence and VR headsets aren‚Äôt known for their luxurious comfort, but on the other hand, enjoyment is of equal importance to help keep you engaged. FitXR is probably not what you‚Äôd expect at first, unlike games such as Creed it is not purely a boxing game, in fact, the only real connection it has with Boxing as a sport is that you see virtual gloves where your controllers should be and you punch targets to a rhythm.


FitXR is actually a lot closer to titles like BeatSaber than any games directly related to sports. You jab and weave to various collective music tracks of all genres, many of the moves mapped by fitness professionals. And as you improve and perform faster songs it really starts to feel great. The sense of a real work out is very real, even if just after 30 minutes of gameplay. There is a decent amount of content and a very comprehensive selection of music to box to which really helps add to its replayability ‚Äì our only wish for content is possibly more arenas to play in, two are very similar and one is pretty generic.


One struggle we had with FitXR early on is that it seemed many of our punches were not being registered, particularly the swings and uppercuts, you can have honed rhythm and excellent timing and yet still seem to miss them almost every time, and the tutorial does not help teach you how to hit the markers the way the game wants you to. The only thing we can say on this is.. persevere, eventually something clicks and after some trial and error you eventually learn how to hit each target precisely, if not you may need to search some guides online as we promise the game is not broken.

2191,Tim Donahey,10/8/2002 0:00,1,Add-ons are a waste of money,"I started out really enjoying the updates to FitXR and wanted to invest in an add-on pack. First off, there is next to no information distinguishing these from one another. Some packs tell you how many tracks there are, others do not. Some tell you how long the pack is, others do not. Some tell you the levels of intensity, others do not. 

So I went with the ""Full-Body"" pack. Seemed pretty self explanatory. What did I get? Well, you don't really know what you're getting until you buy them, but what I got was four 15 minute intermediate workouts. Wow. Four workouts of exactly the same length and exactly the same difficulty. If they had instead called it the ""15 Minute Intermediate Pack,"" I wouldn't have bothered, so I feel cheated.

Also, you can't refund any of these add-on packs. I won't be buying any more.

2199,DoktorDeath,"Dec 30, 2020 at 8:27 AM",5,Back to 5 Stars!,"I am updating my review back up to 5 stars!  I am back to thinking that this is the best fitness title on Oculus.  Bottom line - I get a great workout and have fun doing it.

I have written 2 prior reviews - BoxVR got 5 stars and the update/change to FitXR got 2 stars for killing off some of the best features of BoxVR and at the same time having lots of bugs that made FitXR initially hard to play.  

Now after a series of updates to FitXR, nearly all of the downgrades and flaws were fixed, and the content, gameplay, and overall value has actually been enhanced.

I love the outside environment where it is light enough for me to actually see the orbs that I need to punch before they are upon me.  I am glad that the new ""training mode"" lets me keep my streak going every time I make contact while still rewarding me with those satisfying explosions every time I punch hard.

The music and choreography remains excellent and I can find the workouts I want by any thing I am in the mood for - music genre, time, box vs dance, etc.  I really enjoy punching orbs, blocking, and dodging in sync with the music and beautiful scenery.  I do still miss the awesome custom playlists that I created in BoxVR, but I am ready to move on.

I remain pretty good at the boxing workouts but have a lot to learn about the dance workouts.  However, I absolutely love the idea of expanding the platform to new ways of exercise gaming.  I am willing to pay for more enhancements in the future if they are fun and I can get a good workout and enjoy some tunes at the same time.

The coaching encouragement is a cute enhancement that is not too intrusive.

I find that I like to play solo because seeing scores of others does nothing for me, so I am grateful for that option.

There is only one more major bug to fix.  Calories are still doubled.  Reported it ages ago, but no fix despite 2 otherwise excellent upgrades.  

Bottom line - I am back to loving FitXR.  Super fun way to keep in shape!!!"

2209,Nameless,"Jan 26, 2021 at 3:53 AM",4,Dancing and boxing,"There is dancing and boxing in this. The boxing consists of directional targets that have to be jabbed, uppercut, or hit from the side. It also has optional barriers that make to squat or side squat. It is well-done, but the music could be better aligned with the beat of the targets. It could also use some more metal. The dance is with a recorded instructor and is more impresive in my opinion. The problem with it is that predicting the moves is difficult. There is some repetition so you can get into the swing, but don't expect it at the beginning. There is also a daily challenge that may be done with others or alone.

First if you want just to have a decent workout session this is the app...if you don't mind about visuals. Music is just ok, but something that is pushing me to a refund is the lack of initiative to include more environments. You can add all the music the best workout routines but vr is about an inmerse experience that changes and keep you coming back for more. Please developers for the price tag I know you can do better. Don't get me wrong good app but is just getting behind of this time.

2221,chopsuey07,"Jan 24, 2021 at 8:54 AM",1,Update to previous nonplayable review,"Update 01/23/2021: still can't play. There was a recent ""small"" update i suppose but still having the same issue as before where it'll load to the lobby screen and give me the ""connect to a wifi and create a profile"" and then closing the app. Even tried the possible solution again that I was instructed to do the first time support reached out to me but to no avail. Took the bullet and did a factory reset on the quest 1 headset to see if it'll fix it but unfortunately didn't fix anything and took a while to set up everything else again. Don't know if the problem is just tied to my account or what but not happy not being able to play after paying full price and pretty much taking up free space on the headset, not wanting to uninstall and reinstall over and over. Still have to get my fix off the steam version which mean I'll have to fire up the pc. Worst case is having to rebuy a quest 2 and test it out if it'll fix it or not, but that's too much of a hassle and extra $$ wasted for purely just this app alone. So far this turn out to be a bad investment on the quest 1 for me as of to date. If for some miracle there's a fix or i get it working, I'll remind myself never to update the app again when it was working flawlessly for me.


Previous review:
I couldn't play the game as of the recent update. Get stuck on the loading screen or get a bug that keep telling me to connect to wifi to create profile then crash the app on me. Support did reached out to me and gave me some possible solution to take to see if it'll fix the issues. As of today, still can't play. Last resort might be factory resetting the device to see if it fix it bit don't want to lost all the other stuff. As of right now, I'm getting my fix off of BoxVr on steam. I did had to buy the game again but got it off during a sale, so not too bad. Another approach other folks who can't play the game or want to go back to the old BoxVR if you already purchase FitXR is to link up to a PC and play through the rift store through oculus link, meaning you'll have to buy an extra accessory cable long enough to connect the two device. Only issue if you go that route is it kills the immersion having the cable attach to the head set. I opt to go the steam route version so i can maintain the wireless gameplay and i guess be future proof if i decide to move away from the quest. 

What i like about fitxr compare to boxvr is that it requires you to put a little more effort into your punches to maintain steaks. The option to turn on and off squats makes a big impact on the workout. I notice there's not much squatting in boxvr and wouldn't feel as tired compare to fitxr where enabling squats got me feeling it halfway through the workout. The score board, even though it's pre recorded ghost, keeps me engage and push me harder to try and be the top score. What i like about box vr is that it's that simple. Just you and the target. You get 3 choice of background, which i highly prefer the dark boxing  environment to keep me focus and not distracted by anything else. It's not as buggy as fit xr. Would prefer if they focus mostly on improving the overall performance of the game before implementing the dancing into the game. You get out what you put in. Still waiting for a fix so i don't have to fire up the pc to get my daily fix."

2226,TheRed25,"Jan 22, 2021 at 7:57 PM",4,Great workout sleek design needs variety,"***ADDITION TO PREVIOUS REVIEW:
I am still loving this app (and agree with most everyone‚Äôs thoughts in regards to things that could be improved). However, another thing I don‚Äôt understand is the way calories are counted. They seem WAY too high in the game (when compared to Oculus Move and my Apple Watch). For instance, I finished a 15 min class this morning, and the calories counted in FitXR were 649.  So then I exited out to Oculus Move and it was registering at 159. My Apple Watch said about 230. I can understand that variance (kind of), but why does FitXR calculate it at such a higher number than anything else? Would love for it to be a little more accurate. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I am new to VR (just got a Quest 2), and I am loving this game. That said, I didn‚Äôt understand why it wasn‚Äôt counting my hits as part of a streak until I looked it up. I agree with some of the other reviews, that while this is a nice motivating feature, it can also be extremely irritating at times. I‚Äôd prefer that a streak go as long as you‚Äôre ‚Äúhitting‚Äù each target (regardless of strength), and it just added extra bonus points for each one you hit with extra power (creating that ring). 

I also find myself wishing that you could switch to different environments and settings as well. The look is sleek, and I don‚Äôt dislike it by any means, but just for the sake of variety, it would be nice to have some other options. I mean, it is VR after all ‚Äî why not punch floating orbs at the top of a mountain, or on a rooftop in NYC, or at the bottom of the ocean?? 

Would love to see some options in a future update!  

Other than those small things, I can‚Äôt say how much I love this game. It‚Äôs gotten me excited to do cardio in a way I never really have been. Thanks for that!!"

The streak seems to be based on how hard the game wants you to hit a target instead of how many targets you hit in a row, and then plays a flat dud of a note to let you know that you failed to live up to their arbitrary expectations.  Super annoying to be grooving along to a tune and hearing a dud note every few seconds.  I have this on PSVR and would recommend that version (with the finicky motion trackers) over this."

I've started using 0.5kg wrist weights to make it more of a workout and it seems to work well.

There's enough variety in the boxing routines to keep users satisfied. I have yet to try the dance routines as my play space isn't really large enough, but it's good to have that option in addition to boxercise.

I'd like to thank the devs for an excellent product. The recent update is splendid and I'm glad that 'explosive punch' streaks is an option still, as without this it would be less of a challenge.

Please keep up the good work."
2237,julian,"Dec 23, 2020 at 9:21 AM",5,Brilliant,"I love this game and i only use this and ""the thrill of the fight"" to keep me fit.
If you want to sweat and lose weight then this is definitely the game you need!
The only thing i don't like is it is way to easy to accidentally hit the pause buttons  when you are fully immersive in the game and this can happen quite a few times during a 10 minute work out, if the Dev's would just allow us to choose the pause button, then that would just be the icing on the cake."
2238,Phill,"Jan 9, 2021 at 1:13 AM",2,Quality of workouts varies too much,"The app overall is good, however they need to go back to the drawing board with some of the workouts. As a musician I can tell you that the placement of the hit boxes are totally out of time with the music, making the experience extremely off putting.

My advice is to find your you favourite workouts and stick to just those to avoid disappointment when browsing."
2239,Grace,"Jan 19, 2021 at 7:15 AM",5,Love it and I‚Äôm 57,I‚Äôm a 57 year old woman and love this game! I‚Äôm drenched and playing 45 min a day. I‚Äôm increasingly going higher.
2240,BabaBlaster,"Jan 22, 2021 at 5:37 PM",3,so much potential to be great.. but...,"This game has the potential to motivate you to work out harder and keep pushing yourself to improve your fitness.  However it is held back by a few easy to fix issues 

Hit registration for uppercuts and hooks requires a strange and unpredictable level of accuracy that will break your streak and demotivate you. It seems accuracy of these uppercuts and hooks is prioritized above power and speed of those punches so you will find you slow down for them and  hurting your workout. 

The Pause button is too easy to tap accidentally and when you use pause the return to game has zero delay so you miss your next hit breaking your streak and again demotivation you. 

There is no way to filter classes by boxing/dance 

There is no clear way to add a class you like to your favorites list. If it's there I still can't find it.


Fix these and it's a 5 star app.. for now it's just too frustrating to get a good score"
2241,Murray,"Jan 24, 2021 at 4:30 PM",5,So far good,"I really enjoy the boxing part. You have good music selection, but as a Christian was wondering if you could have a christian music pack?"
2242,Amelia,"Dec 29, 2020 at 11:11 PM",3,"Great workout, a little glitchy","You will SWEAT! I am always sore the next day after playing this. It really is a great workout and has fun music tracks to move to. But it‚Äôs a little glitchy in that every now and then it seems to lose track of the controllers and hits that I have definitely made are counted as misses, or one of the gloves will just start to kind of float away even though my hand is not moving that way. It‚Äôs actually a bit funny to watch, but frustrating because it wrecks my stats! Overall I still recommend. Be prepared to wash your face cushion after use. Also in the future would be cool to get some popular songs to be able to download like Rock Band or Beat Saber do.

Update 2: Post app makeover. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen an app/game reinvent itself so completely, yet not fix the actual issues. It looks great and months later there is finally another environment option. They *did* improve the dodge and block actions. I still have a lot of issues with that rogue hand just randomly floating away, which doesn‚Äôt happen with any other fast-paced game. Only this one. Which, logically, tells me it‚Äôs the game, not my hardware. It also still sometimes just whiffs the target, even though I clearly hit it. These things happen a lot less often that with the previous version, but still often enough to be aggravating in an app I spent money on. Still one of the better ones out there though. Gonna take my rating from 4 stars to 3 for not fixing the glitches and just making it prettier. I‚Äôm a function over fashion kind of girl. 

Update: I‚Äôve played it a bit more and it‚Äôs still a great workout BUT- I don‚Äôt know if game developers actually read these or not- in addition to that rogue glove that floats off on its own every now and then, some of my hits that CLEARLY landed my fist just goes right through the target and counts as a miss, seemingly at random. For some reason the block target is incredibly inconsistent with whether it thinks I ‚Äúhit‚Äù it or not, even though I do the same thing every time. I just finished a session where almost none of the blocks counted, even though the gloves were clearly crossed on screen. Also, the ‚Äúdodge‚Äù barrier is ridiculous. Unless you‚Äôre Neo from the Matrix (spoiler: I am not) and able to bend your spine 90 degrees, even though it passes over my head, it counts as a miss. A hit? It resets my streak counter. This has been leading to me taking steps away from center while also bending over to avoid it and it STILL says I didn‚Äôt dodge. To the point where, even though I‚Äôm in a 7‚Äôx7‚Äô play space, my grid shows up to warn me I‚Äôm stepping out. And then I miss the next targets because I‚Äôm way off center! Also, the hardware is not meant for head movement like that. I have bruises on the bridge of my nose from it hitting and putting pressure there, even though it‚Äôs tightened as far as it can be. Maybe my face is just too small? Either way, the angle of the dodge barrier is way too extreme and I saw other reviews complaining of the same thing. I have since just let them ‚Äúhit‚Äù me but it‚Äôs so discouraging to continually hear that ‚Äúbeeboop‚Äù and see the streak counter reset to zero even though I‚Äôm working my butt off. Despite all this, I‚Äôm leaving the four star rating for now because it still is a great workout and I‚Äôm hopeful that these things might be improved in the (hopefully near) future."

I really love the FitVR upgrade. BoxVR's visuals were tired and slightly buggy. FitVR's sci fi theme may not be to everyone's taste, but it is to mine! Looks super sharp and the game is once again exciting.

I also really enjoyed the multi-player mode, and I'm saying this as someone who really doesn't like multi-player in games with strangers. 

Nice work, team."

2266,Tezziws,"Oct 18, 2020 at 6:23 PM",1,"Stay away, this is a downgrade to BOXVr","You can't make custom playlist anymore. They want you to buy the DLC not custom your own... $$$. 

The streak thing is massively difficult and de-motivating. No way of adjusting the settings. I've boxed a little, but I'm 46...I managed 81. The top players in my games had over 1000. I take it  only pro boxers play this game?

It's not multiplayer BTW plus I dont want to see some other ghost players who are not even live, how do I turn these players off? 

Only one Gym now. 

Furthermore, they have already admitted they built the game from the ground up. So they bought the userbase and changed the game completely. If you have the original game then you must have the source code, why reinvent the wheel. Here is my best guess. They know the userbase likes the game, subsequently they buy userbase, take away functionality (pretend it's a revamp with the odd fancy graphic) and hope userbase doesn't mind buying back functionality in the future...give me a break. 

If you added extra options to BOXVR then great but you took functionality away so yeah 1 star."
2267,Brittany,"Jan 20, 2021 at 7:03 AM",4,Great workout,I love this game.. wish there was more free workouts or the change to ‚Äúadvance‚Äù to longer or tougher workouts. But all in all a fun way to to workout

I have tried to adjust but somehow keep on missing to hit. While rorizontal punch has no problem. There should be a better mechanism maybe. Another part...how if it has a beat saber mechanism look like...when we miss a punch...there us like an x flying away or some kind of indication for simple visual. Right now i can not concentrate on the score...and when the ball just passing by. So ..like there is no sense or stimuli when it passung you when you miss them. In overall....yes..this VR is a good way to sweat without seing other squating in fron of you
2270,Y,"Dec 29, 2020 at 2:16 PM",4,Love the game small tweaks needed,"FitXR is one of the first games I downloaded for my Oculus Quest 2 and boy is it a workout! I use it almost every day and it's been helping me lose weight.

Glows:
1. Fun and High energy
2. Options for other workout locations (gym or outdoors)
3. I can replay the workouts I love or struggle with
4. Works out my entire body
5. Two work out types to keep it interesting

Grows: 
1. Can't work out with friends
2. Targets aren't well timed to the music (if you're someone who uses the rhythm to time yourself, you can sometimes miss targets)


Overall this is an amazing app and a big part of my workout and weight loss routine"

I thought box vr was just gone. I re purchased expansion packs. You have to be kidding me. Then it was so bad went to find out where box vr went to the sad disappointment of it having been changed to a glitchy program. And why?  So I can have the feeling other people are in the room with me. Not why I started using VR. Absolutely horrid.

Pros: boxVR Gets you working hard each time, you can measure your performance and see the gains in speed and levels. I‚Äôm left drenched after each session and pumped for more.

Cons: danceVR is exactly the opposite, I.e I don‚Äôt find it that useful if I‚Äôm just copying a dancer in front of me. The motion capture does not even properly register the moves, I could be making a fool of myself in reality and scoring 5 pointers with each move.

I think eventually it will get repetitive if developers don‚Äôt constantly update the app and make it more about fitness rather than anything.

BoxVR should be the primary focus, improved UI, more environments, more audio maps, better tracking, 90hz frame rate, better feedback on controllers for quest 2 etc."

I didn‚Äôt have these problems before the update. The issue is also happening on my quest 1. I also am experiencing lag that causes the screen to get stuck which gets disorienting causing minor nausea. It‚Äôs completely immersion breaking.

2290,RygelFievel,"Dec 28, 2020 at 3:34 PM",2,Trying to appease both camps,"The issue with FitXR vs BoxVR boils down to two camps. Fitness first or gaming first.  Personally, I‚Äôm in the former camp.  Gamers want to be rewarded for consecutive streaks to increase their score and that meant tapping the target was all that‚Äôs required to maintain your streak. With the update, this no longer can be achieved unless you put more effort into your punches which in turn puts off the user in playing. 

I appreciate that you are now rewarded for faster punches or what is perceived as faster punches, as the estimation is far from perfect and glitches still remain in registering punches even if you hit the target with force.  With that being said, I‚Äôm disappointed they still haven‚Äôt brought back the leaderboards yet even when they have stated it will return at some point.

The developers have also stated that the ghost multiplayers are selected at random and also based on skill. I‚Äôve played the new version enough to realize they are not matchmaking players to make it appear more competitive. Another complaint is that this is not true multiplayer anymore and this can be easily remedied by pairing a minimum amount of live players in a lobby before filling out the remaking players with ghosts. 

In order to appease both camps, they should bring back the gaming aspect and have their own leaderboard separate from the fitness side.  Give the game some time to improve before making final judgment as this is only the third iteration of the revamped game as of this review. The blatant bugs from the initial release have been fixed but I have yet to see any improvements to the game to address user concerns from BoxVR such as scenery, explosive SFX and live multiplayer.  The physical aspect of the game has been greatly improved and is now an exercise game first with gaming aspects thrown in.  Now I can exercise in half the time I used to and still feel I had a better workout from BoxVR.

edit: To include dance update. FitXR has been very slow to address bugs introduced in the dance update. Statistics are completely broken for the boxing aspect of the game. They acknowledge the issue but have yet to issue a patch to fix basic statistics which affect overall statistics. Basically it will show you completed a class IF you go in My Activity but overall statistics are zero but takes into account the amount of time you spent in that class with 0 punch speed average the whole time but calculates this into your lifetime average which will drop like a rock. They don‚Äôt say if overall statistics will be fixed at a later point but acknowledge the bug. So you may have to start a brand new profile in order to keep your lifetime statistics average AFTER they fix the bug.  Seems FitXR is too busy these days making new music packs rather than fix glaring bugs in the game including basic filtering after completing a workout.  Review updated to reflect slow response to bugs which affects lifetime statistics.

edit2: Somehow they‚Äôve managed to botch another update. Punch prediction is worse and the new environment affects punch speed for the Quest in addition to it losing framerates which leads to even more punches passing through your glove than ever before. Used to routinely get streaks over 1000 but have yet to achieve this since the update. They fixed recording of statistics; however, it doesn‚Äôt take into account that the skewed averages now so that information is basically useless unless you start a new profile.  Their Discord is like a ghost town."

2292,Starthouse,"Jan 4, 2021 at 6:40 AM",1,Nothing but frustration,The game needs a lot of work. It could be a solid game if they would fix the hit boxes.

1. The calorie count shows over twice what Oculus Move shows even though personal details are the same. Oculus Move also seems be be more inline with my Samsung Watch calorue burn estimation. What is correct?

2. An obvious enhancement is for multilayer so you can workout with friends and family. The AI players are nice but real multi player would be awesome.

3. When I punch targets probably 30% of the time it sounds like I just missed when from my point of view I was bang on the beat. I play many rhythm games and have pretty good timing. It could be due to the punch sound. Shortening this could help but it could be generally a timing issue in the app or bad bpm matching with the songs.

Overall though this is great and I highly recommend."

2301,CaneDomi,"Jan 10, 2021 at 3:46 AM",3,Fix The Pause Button,"This is a great game. While I never had a chance to try out BoxVR which is what I originally wanted, FITXR is a lot of fun and can be a great daily workout. The tracking, songs and rhythm flow perfectly. The main issue I have with this game is that you can unintentionally hit the x button and pause the game. There is nothing more irritating and turn off from playing this game then getting really into a session and hitting your explosive streaks only to stop completely unexpected. Then resume to miss a lot of shots. This really ruins the experience. I recommend adding to option to re-map the keys or adding a long press to pause the game. Possibly a countdown after resuming the game like in Beat Saber. Currently the pause button is where a lot of people naturally place their thumb when making a fist. DEVS please fix this."

2312,ArtfulPablo,"Nov 29, 2020 at 1:18 PM",5,A proper VR workout,"This is the only VR game that really gives me a decent workout, and I haven't even tried the more intense levels. At its core it's fairly simple - hitting oncoming orbs, and ducking beneath bars, but it is really satisfying to hit the orbs so motivates you to carry on. If you hit the orb hard enough then you get a little explosion and also get to continue your steak, and those two things together really keep you motivated to keep hitting hard.

Other reviews sound like people have issues with hits registering properly, but I have not had that issue - if it doesn't register a hit it always feels like it's because I've genuinely missed or mistimed a hit.

I can't comment on the dance element of the game as I'm not really interested in that.

One downside is that you end up with a sweaty headset because the workout is so good, but can't really blame the game for that!

Sounds like the game is being actively developed, so I imagine other things will be added to the game over time."
2313,Iamme,"Jan 31, 2021 at 11:12 PM",4,Awesome!,I was surprised at how much fun the boxing is. I am dripping sweat by the end of my workouts. I just wish I could box with friends. Other than that this app is great!
2314,nauticus,"Dec 20, 2020 at 8:55 PM",4,"Updated: great workout, fun, some flaws","Dec2020 update: the experience is better now. Accuracy has improved. The new environment offers a brighter option. It's still not without flaws (every track change has a slight lag and glitch which should be fixed, shot accuracy still doesn't seem great) hence taking a star off. But it's a great workout experience. One other thing that would take this to the next level would be to include options of constructing your own workouts (eg by using pieces or songs from existing workouts based on what you like). 

Old review: I used boxvr daily. While there were a few glitches it was an awesome experience even if it was a bit plain - I would've given it 5 stars no doubt. Don't fix something that ain't broken! This new update has brought too techy a feel, shots don't register particularly in faster workouts, rhythm isn't accurate especially with consecutive shots, the nice looking realistic environments are gone, it feels like you're in a closed spaceship, and in faster workouts you feel overwhelmed in the sparks from the new animations. I understand that some may have wanted this, but please provide at least a retro option for those of us who want a simple gym style realistic experience, to go back to what we enjoyed. This new game is not the workout experience I bought"
2315,Ash,"Dec 20, 2020 at 12:49 PM",4,Good for a sweat!,"(This review has not been tainted by previous BoxVR ownership.)  

I‚Äôve been playing FitXR for 3 months now and use it 3-4 times a week. I use moderate and intense in all lengths up to the longest, depending on my wko goals for the day. I cannot rate easy as I have not used it. 

Cutting to the chase: while it‚Äôs not perfect (what is), I keep coming back to it because it serves its purpose for at home cardio in a fun format. 

The Good: 
‚Ä¢ You‚Äôll work up a sweat! 
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs comparable in level of effort to doing a live group class or video based home work out. But more fun because of the gamification. It‚Äôs really a workout that has been made into a game vs a game that gives you a workout. 
‚Ä¢ The music is pretty good most of the time. 
‚Ä¢ Scoring. While the classes aren‚Äôt live, it‚Äôs motivating to have a goal to beat and see yourself move up the leaderboard, leapfrogging others and holding your position keep you engaged. Also scoring In the form of streaks is fun. 
‚Ä¢ no notable glitches

Room for Improvement:
‚Ä¢ Difficulty ratings feel random at times - like they were rated subjectively by different people. Sometimes I do an intense that feels moderate. Sometimes I land in a moderate that‚Äôs more intense than most of the intense. 
‚Ä¢ Need more game details: tell me how many squats and punches are in a class (help me decide for myself if it‚Äôs moderate or intense and the shades in between). I really like the added squats, so it‚Äôs frustrating to go through a class and end up with minor number if squats when I want a good work out. 
‚Ä¢ Ability to Favorite a class at the class details page. Sometimes I‚Äôm tired and sweaty and if you forget to favorite at the end of the class there is no other way to go back and favorite. Annoying. 
‚Ä¢ A short history would be nice. Last 5-10 classes completed or even just a ‚Äúlast played on‚Äù date at the class detail. I can‚Äôt remember off the top of my head and then sometimes find myself accidentally picking the same one I recently did. By the time I realize it then I don‚Äôt want to break my groove to go back out and pick another class. 
‚Ä¢ Change up the environment. When you do the longer classes, or multiple shorter back to back...the same environment becomes monotonous and I start to lose interest. Some small tweaks in colors could go a long way in keeping it visually engaging. 
‚Ä¢ Too many repeated songs. It feels like there are 20 intense songs that are just put together in a different order for each class. If I hear that chick ‚Äúput it in reverse‚Äù one more time, I might lose it!

Things I‚Äôm indifferent to: 
‚Ä¢ Calorie burn stats: these are not and cannot be accurate without a heart rate measure. And they are always wildly over estimated. Why bother? It‚Äôs just for ‚Äúshow‚Äù. Players can wear their own chest or wrist monitors to get accurate measurements if they care to. Otherwise you‚Äôre just misleading people. 
‚Ä¢ Class level. Meh. There are so many other gauges and pushes for effort. This always ends up 10 for me and so it‚Äôs really just a way for me to know if I‚Äôve ever played a class or not. 
‚Ä¢ The new dance classes. Not for me (doesn‚Äôt mean they are bad, just not my jam). 

What keeps me from buying add-on content: 
Fear that it‚Äôs the same environment with the same recycled songs and subjective difficulty ratings. The game is good but not great, so why would I expect add-ons to be any better than just more of the same?

Other comments:
I would have loved to see any one of the improvements above before the addition of dance. There are plenty of other dance options to buy if people are into that (clearly I‚Äôm not). Focus on making a superior fitness game of which there are fewer. If anyone figures out how to make leg sensors and build a kickboxing VR or something akin to Kenpo from the P90x series...I‚Äôm so in!"

2317,James,"Jan 3, 2021 at 8:24 AM",4,Good workout but encourages bad form,"Doing 30 minutes of this is a great workout. The ""power"" meter should just be called a speed meter. The faster you snap your arms to hit it, the higher the meter goes. This can encourage you to snap your arms faster, making you use your arms and shoulders more, rather than proper boxing technique to punch with your body. Since there's no way to measure actual power (from the body's weight and torque), hitting things harder actually shows you less ""power"" and points. 

Also there's way too right hooks and the timing to some of these combos can be off. Keep it mind it's gamified boxing, not real boxing and learn proper form to punch with your body, not your arms."

2328,FatLlama31882,"Dec 1, 2020 at 4:00 PM",3,Was good when it was BoxVR,"Now that they have rebranded to FitXR or whatever, the game feels to have gone downhill. I don't like the UI though not very helpful I can't say why.

I think it requires an internet connection just to have a workout... 
That is if what the UI is telling me is correct. I was halfway through a long workout when it disconnected, why would a workout disconnect I'm not competing with anyone I'm trying to have fun and workout at the same time all on my own.

Also as someone who has actual experience boxing the hooks and uppercuts either have bad timing or bad hit detection. I am forced to throw bad punches to time it right this often leads me to lose combos when I get into a flow state because I have stopped focusing on ruining my form to land punches.

What it does great is have you switch stance for an even workout. Adds in blocks rolls and slips for some good defence work. I haven't got any DLC levels so what I'm about to say may be covered there, but I feel they could do with some better combos. Nobody is doing a roll waiting 2 seconds then rolling again. This is where boxVR was better they seemed to have better boxing workouts whereas this is like a crappy boxercise."

All the punches are perfectly timed with the beats to the various songs, but no matter what movement , hand position  or variation I try for the block move, it‚Äôs always slightly off the beat, usually late rather than early, which is super irritating when you‚Äôre in the groove! I‚Äôve tried just letting it come to me, I‚Äôve tried moving the block position out to hit it, every which way, but it still just never syncs up with the beat like the punches do!  If you can fix this one flaw that would be perfect."

I always thought the ‚Äúhit points‚Äù were a bit out of line, but since the update it happens more and you seem punch right through them without being registered by the game. 
It is not always the case.  Seems to happen more with upper cuts. But also with the other type of hits.
I tried to improve to calibrate the gloves, but that certainly did not do the trick. 
The tracking issues (if that is the cause) happens once in a while, but it spoils the essence of the game. If this does not change I will be thrown back to ‚Äúthrill of the fight‚Äù or other boxing games.
Waiting for a new update eagerly.....

Edit: after changing both the gloves ‚Äòupside down‚Äô the chance that you are actually hitting side cuts and uppercuts has definitely increased. It is only a workaround, but it brings a bit of fun back to game..."

And it's still online only for some pointless reason since there is no multiplayer. Leaderboards is not an excuse. With games like Audica, Synth Riders, Beat Saber, and other rhythm games, there's no real point to purchasing this game unless you want to workout to crappy music you're forced to listen to if you even consider playing the game is even worth playing.

My one gripe is that the calorie counter is way to generous count about triple the number of calories than my YUR fitness tracker which I think is must more accurate.

The shadow boxing that this app makes you do when playing is very gentle and good cardio. I've been playing this intensively and had absolutely no injuries as I would expect with almost any other new intensive activity as long as I'm care not to hyper extend.

2348,Deaddy,"Nov 18, 2020 at 1:17 AM",3,"Good game, but...","First of all, when the game is good, it's a really enjoyable workout that gets me sweating a lot and its a lot of fun. But to get there I feel there are some ways I feel the user interface could be improved :

1. Let me hear what I get before I start the workout:
My enjoyment depends a lot on the right tracks, my mood and the rhythm I want to get into. The way it is now, since the names are relatively nondescript and there is no tracklist in the menu I need to start the workout to decide if I want to do it, then quit if I don't feel it.

2. Let me see what I did before. 
In the main menu there is no obvious way to see if I did a workout recently. The statistics are also not helping here. A history list in the today/week/month sections would be nice. 

3. favourites don't seem to work. Maybe just me..

4. Filters don't stick until after the workout. Sometimes they also mess up and show things that should be filtered away when stepping back out of a workout description.

5. Tell me what I am listening to. Some of the tracks are neat, could you show artists and titles?

Also I feel like the tracking of the songs is really a mixed bag:
Some songs are completely on the money, every punch is on the beat. Sometimes though, in the same workout, they are offbeat and it's quite hard to hit when trying to go with the rhythm of the music.

I should also say that I am mainly rating the boxing , as that is thus far the only workouts I did because that was the main purchasing reason."
2349,noizde,"Dec 29, 2020 at 8:02 AM",4,My go-to exercise app for any pace,"Since there's a good variety of classes by length and intensity, I'm guaranteed to find one that fits just how much I want to do for that session. I like a lot of the songs, too! The explosive feedback is also a lot more satisfying than prev iterations. Liking the sky park environment as well. My one complaint - not sure if it's a me problem but hard to get feedback on it - is that the beat mapping for some of the classes pushes me more to flailing around to hit targets from the right direction, at the expense of good form."

I bought all the addons for the game and so far all I can say is give it a chance its cheaper then most one month gym memberships so really whats there to loose and if I can do it in my truck any body can do it in their own home or office space.

Also as another reviewer mentioned some more genres of music would be great. Personally I love to work out to soca, calypso, reggaeton, dancehall etc stuff that gets your legs and hips wanting to really groove to the workout."

I at least go through one of the 3 minute courses in the morning and in the evening, and very much look forward to doing so.

As a side note: I recommend studying proper punching form before/while using this app. It did not take long before my muscles let me know that my form has slipped a lot since I stopped practicing 10+ years ago."

The two versions feel slightly different and FitXR has dance classes that aren‚Äôt offered in BoxVR. I found myself preferring the Quest‚Äôs FitXR over BoxVR. It‚Äôs very challenging and the multiplayer makes for good competition. 

Highly recommended getting this is you‚Äôre looking for a great cardio workout mixed in with a fun time! I‚Äôm gonna buy all of the DLC for this one too, it‚Äôs well worth the investment."

Cool musics and coperative mode is super too!"
2357,Meh,"Dec 26, 2020 at 4:02 PM",4,Good but Scoring needs work.,"I've been playing this game for about 6 months on quest , since before the big update. Overall I like it and it has been a good way to get some exercise in lockdown but to keep it challenging it really needs to have improvements in the scoring to keep me wanting to play. I'd also like to see more music packs and variety in the music. I'm happy to pay for decent updates and tunes like on beat sabre. As for the dance that was added that's a nice addition but it's not something I am into so I'd rather just keep boxing.

The issues I have are:
1) I have no idea how it allocates other player scores for you to comete against. Is it just a random 10 ? I generally find that I am near the top and competing with only one or two others with the rest of the scores way lower. It would be much better to have the other 9 players roughly the same level. 
2) There are no global scoreboards. This would be a really good feature. As mentioned above there is no way to know who you are up against so no consistency between sessions unless you compete against yourself...
3) If I've done a workout before why not add my previous best as one of the other bots ? 
4) How the scoring works is a little unclear in terms of the streaks and how much bonus you get. Given that there are sometimes issues and glitches which can make you miss and break a streak having the multiplier for streaks too high can be annoying. (This may have changed and it would be useful to know if the scores are going to be different depending upon your choice of the streak mode just introduced).
5) The stats are still worse than they were for the old box vr. That would let me see my averages for each punch type. That would be great to see again as it gives you things to work on. My stats estopped working for a few weeks and none of those sessions appear but it has messed up my all time stats now.
6) I really dislike the weird downward punch that is in some of the sessions. I'd like to be able to turn it off."

No option to add routines to play back to back, instead you have to waste time starting up a new one. No option to add a routine to favorites without completing it first. Squats are not interspersed even semi evenly, instead you get a dozen or more in a row & gets boring & stupid.

I‚Äôve been meaning to give you a five star review for BoxVR but this version gets a three. The interface is super awkward. UPDATE: Two months later, have gotten used to the disco and can now work out without headaches. I still miss the clean wood gym though.

The only constant with this game is that it has gotten progressively worse the longer that it has been worked on. More choice being removed will always be the way forward for these devs, and if you like the app now, it may be different next year.

The devs will keep changing things because that is their only job, at this point. I have had this since the original steam release.

It has gone from a game to a content delivery platform and I would not be surprised to see forced Facebook integration down the line."
2368,Constarr,"Dec 23, 2020 at 7:36 PM",4,Good workout but tracking/lag issues,"For the most part I‚Äôm happy with this app and the quality of the workouts I get with it. I‚Äôm drenched at the end after ~25 minutes and often don‚Äôt actually want to stop which is great. Music so far is ‚Äúmeh‚Äù but good enough.

The main problem I have is with the tracking and periodic lag when registering hits. Sometimes it feels perfect and on the beat, other times it‚Äôs off, feels laggy, and really ruins  the experience. Compared to other rhythm apps FitXR feels lacking. If this were fixed I think this would bump it up to 5 stars for me.

For the dance workouts, it would be great to have some indicator of what move is coming up next like other apps. Sometimes they tell you which is helpful, but usually they don‚Äôt and it‚Äôs hard to maintain a streak without knowing. 

Multiplayer with randoms or friends would also be a great addition. I‚Äôd love to be able to interact with others more or attend scheduled classes and talk for a little after."

Having the Quest 2, I thought I would give this another go. 

I love how this has been gamified with scores and people to beat, encouraging you to push harder however, the streak system is awful. There seems no logic into why you lose a streak, especially when the coach shouts 'great timing' just as your streak is lost.

Fix the streak system or lose it completely. As it stands, it is more frustrating than encouraging."

2382,Kaputis,"Dec 24, 2020 at 9:17 PM",3,Needs internet connection (really),"It does what it's supposed to do - makes you sweat. Two types of exercises - ""boxing"" with optional squats (good), and aerobics-like dancing (not so good, imho), but plenty of content. Almost no exercise customization options (difficulty and length are fixed for each exercise), but that's not such a big deal, imho. Musically, it is great. Very good sense of contributing to the rhythm, no mind boggling hidden rhymes a'la Pistol Whip. Also, boxing type exercises work because you are encouraged to hit hard, just like, in say, Thrill of the Fight. Just light slaps, even if perfectly timed and correct, will simply not count in to the streak making you leak points like crazy. Keep that in mind, and a mare three minutes session will break a decent sweat (for most gamers, that is ;)). This means that you do not need to ""play"" it for long. Can't, in fact. This way it does not become repetitive :)

However, it requires internet connection and logging in takes place in game, so there seems to be no walkarounds, contrary to, say, Racket Furry. That makes no sense considering how much this costs and that you can exercise ""on your own"" (i.e., de facto offline, which is what I always do). A star off.

Finally, it asks for a host of your personal details when performing the in-game registration. Plus, for some reason an exercise may take a very long time to load sometimes. So one more star off."

Why did you transform the gym decor into a stark and dark arcade game?

Why did you remove the calorie counter during the game?

Why have you put the time for the session so far and high that you don't have time to read it between 2 punches?

Why in the menu of training choices we cannot directly see if we have already done it or not like in the old menu? In general, moreover the new menu is really less well presented.

Why is there no more ""beep"" when you miss a target?

Why does the series start from zero many times even when you hit the target very well?

Why do we no longer adjust the color of the gloves (I haven't found it anyway) ... because the blue of the gloves and the targets is the same color as the blue counter at the back of the room ... d 'elsewhere it blurs the view of having put some things in the background.

Why  the long loading time to start a workout now .?

And other and other why...



In short and so on I come out of this disastrous experience ... I never comment on anything usually on the internet, but it annoys me and it disgusts me to see that a game that was really good at the base and which just deserved a few improvements turned into a correct game for new players but terribly frustrating for old players so much it lost in quality, ergonomics, consistency and playing options.

 Hoping that you take into account these constructive remarks for the future of this new version ... otherwise you might as well put the old one back online!  

And in order to end on a positive note anyway, the only novelty that improves the game is the new design of the targets and the graphic effect when you touch them.


The only evolution that would deserve 10 stars for me would be a 180 ¬∞ / 360 ¬∞ mode like in Beat Saber."

So much that I even bought two of the DLCs & was planning on buying the 3rd but put away the Q1 for a couple months bc i was too busy w/ work. 
Last week I bought the Q2 & was looking forward to boxing. Noticed the name change & assumed, foolishly it turns out, that there were improvements. Just finally tried it & it is completely unplayable. Every class is grayed out except the 2 recommended classes for the day that are both only 3min long, not long enough when yur wanting 20-30min at a minimum.

I tried buying the rock pack just now, & went thru all the normal steps but it's still grayed out, like it was b4 I went thru the transaction screen. Even the essentials pack it shows I bought are not grayed but I cannot click on them, as nothing happens when I do. Not happy."
2397,VickVonCBU,10/6/2002 0:00,5,The most effective fitness "game" !,"I didn't have much hope from this game after reading the reviews. However, I finally decided to try it in view of the oculus store's refund policy. What I discovered, was what I had already suspected for some time, that there is nothing more wrong than to think that the human experience is universal, or at least similar. 
The app is intended for those with minimal knowledge of how to punch or block a shot. I am convinced that negative aspects of movement tracking are due to poor execution.  Such a game can be considered without mistake as a genuine cardio workout, when the striking/parring procedures are carried out in the correct form. . I suppose that's where the people who gave bad reviews to this app fall - lack of minimum knowledge of punching/parring procedures used in boxing. This can be easily repaired by following online tutorials about the correct execution of these techniques. 
However, the worst reviews refer to an ""old game"" that I do not know and with which those who criticize this game compare. Irrelevant reviews in my opinion. All I know is that evolution without change is not possible and I think that is the case with this application as well. 
For those who have a minimum physical condition and are eager to upgrade this condition   in a pleasant way, I can only recommend them to try this ""training program"" masked in a game.
I bought all the addons without hesitation, although the total price was not low (I considered this as an investment in my health). 
Congratulations and thanks to those who made this experience possible. There's plenty of room for improvement, but I am convinced that there will be not much time until the production team will ""polish"" the app ."

I am a Unity VR developer and I know how simple it is to disable button mappings or exclude inputs from actions. Just turn the flipping face buttons off and only use the pause button. This game is driving me nuts with accidental pauses during heavy sessions.

Leaving only 2 stars because the way the A+B+X+Y buttons can pause the game easily when you are going for swings really puts me off my workouts especially when I'm in the flow.

If something like beat saber did this too people would be mad. Make the pause button on the controller the actual Oculus pause button.

When you are in an online workout session there is no good reason to pause the session anyway!

Also didn't get point  to have  paid DLC since in game library isn't that huge and few extra workout plans would help , DLCs can be grouped with less price or given later since you already buy the game its not a free , yet with the current options you can have good workout with other games  like beat saber or the thrill of the fight etc..
For future reference it would be cool to have the ability add custom workout/songs similar to Oh shape or beat saber ."

With the update, you took that feature away. You actually gave me a downgrade and that literally sucks.

2420,Alex,"Sep 28, 2020 at 8:42 AM",1,Give me back what I paid for,"The FitXR update is nowhere near BoxVR and this is unfair to take away things without asking.

- New version only comes with a few songs - the rest I have to buy. I can understand that if it was older version - and any new song comes for $1 or even monthly subscription. This is business and creating games like this is expensive. However, in BoxVR I had a long list of songs to choose from - it is now gone, the packs are enforcing music genres I am not interested in. I bought an extreme pack to see if this unlocks song selections - no it does not. This is not fair. You have taken away what I paid for!

- Old gym, familiar environments, understandable meters and gauges - all gone, now I am in an uncomfortable futuristic space with hard to understand gauges in many places around the area. Give me back my environment.

- I dont like these faces you are suggesting as ""trainers"" and their comments on my acting. I dont know these people, they dont cause positive feedback in me. I find them unattractive at least and  random artificial shouts like ""Amazing speed!"" every few seconds are annoying at least. They are not real people I see in gym. I dont know them, I dont want them. There is no option to swicth them off the menus and sounds. Give me back the older BoxVR version without neccesity to hear them.

- Game design is poor. Visual effect and wow-factors are there. But you can't play much long with orbs exploding a myriad colored droplets in your face. If I had epilepsy I'd be in hospital for sure. Nothing is configurable on/off/effect type. Totally weird menus, necessity to select from a single option list (my only profile), clickable buttons that look like unclickable, gauges out of scope - design mistakes I can live with and can get used to.

But please do release BoxVR as a separate app or APK and move me over to it. I want to have back the experience I paid for and was using daily for very long time until you have taken it away from me."

2433,Christian,"Sep 26, 2020 at 8:18 AM",3,What happened?,"What happened?
  BoxVr was pretty good. Was it buggy sometimes? Yes, but it felt more enjoyable than this update. No more custom playlist, different gyms and what seems like less classes to choose from. However,if you want more songs and workouts you can buy packs for that. It‚Äôll cost you $9.99 for each one though. Seems like this update was made to just get you to pay more for the songs and classes. 

Pros
  It does seem to run smoother in my opinion. Also added in hit power and better tracking to keep you motivated. Also you can choose between solo and online play with or without squats. 

Cons
  Honestly just feels like a watered down version of the original. Almost reminds me of a trail game. List of features taken away and an emphasis on buying the other packs 

Verdict
  Still a decent workout vr game but if you played the original, you definitely know this isn‚Äôt as good. If you already have Beat Saber then just wait till they update this game to buy it."

I am not referring to the scoring system or whether the strike is counted towards a streak but whether the strike is registered at all.

Multiplayer works now. Server Bug is fixed.
So again 4 Stars. 
Habe some Problems with Tracking on fast Targets live bevor.
If You fixed it and and add some more functions like friends .. ich will give 5 Stars.

Update 06.11.2020 Dance Now
I test in the morning the Dance Studio. 
It's nice to warm up but I find it to difficult. I like more the Box Studio. 
But for both Studios I played one Dance and 5 Box Sessions and in every Session I'm only alone. No other Player. Some days ago, no Problems. Is this a Bug? 
I test it again and I'm only alone. No other Player after the Update. 

Update 09.August.2020 Version 1.0 4 Stars

- Now Multiplayer works. No Connection Drop when Music Change. Perfect. 

- Serie/Strike works better but not perfect. 
Sometimes Counter is set to Zero and I don't know why. The Problem accurs when hitting Target from the Side sometimes from button. I can see, that 1-2 Player in a Session can make big Series. I Think thy are PC Players with Steam and external TrackerStations? I don't know? 

So I give now 4 Stars instead of 2. It's very good motivation to play VS 6 other Players. 

Why not 5 Stars? 
Missing the following Options:
-Multiplayer vs Friends. 
-Level Display and Score under a workout, so I can immediately see that I have played the workout and with what score
-Display in Multiplayer from what System the other Player is (Steam, Windows, Oculus, other) like in Ohshape and the sex (men or woman) 
- Filter to Player only VS Woman or men or Mix. It's better for woman I think. 


Update 02.August.2020 Version 0.9 2 Stars

The new version FitXR is very good, if it weren't for the following problems:

 

Bugs:

1) Multiplayer

As soon as the song changes, all connections of the other players are disconnected and you only play alone.

2) Series

A series is not possible. Constantly and without any recognizable connection, the series is constantly reset. The points are counted for the hit but still the series is set to 0. This happens constantly in every game.

Improvements:

1) Training selection

Unfortunately it is not possible to see which training has already been played. This is really cumbersome. A display under the training would be very helpful.

2)Multiplayer

There should also be a possibility to play against your friends from the friends list.

Besides, FitXR crashed the first time after about 1 hour. Coincidence?

 

If the bugs are just fixed, I give full 5 stars. The tracking is perfect and the graphics have improved again.

I don't know how the bugs could not be detected by the quality assurance."
2442,Shredtoolz,"Dec 6, 2020 at 7:30 PM",4,My VR 99% of the time,"I was hooked on this on my 4 ceiling tracker Rift CV1 PC setup when it was BoxVR and once it was brought to quest it really became my daily go-to for my go-to fitness regiment that is fun.  I have mixed feelings of the complete change over from what the old version of BoxVR offered compared to this new FitXR which I legit play almost daily for 500 to 2000kCal of the extreme sessions.  I've dropped about 40lbs since Easter 2020 playing this and inline trail skating 10 to 26 mile sessions and some ice hockey.  I added 1.6lb glove wraps for better swing velocity resistance which has yet to be accounted for in any settings despite good feedback about it from the devs.  I only care about the fitness results rather than any score numbers.  The play with others is basically a bunch of, I'm guessing, best or most recent recorded session data of the other players in the group as pause pauses everything and you can't talk or interact with anyone.  I'd like a true co-op with friends added and I'd still like to have the old version back as an alternate.  Overall this is by far the best regimented musical rhythm punching cardio game there is as the courses are repeatable for time and burn compared to a boxing SIM.

2449,Ardobicum,"Dec 6, 2020 at 3:38 AM",1,No way out of the game?,"Review of FIT XR (December 2020):

Can it be true? I did not find a way to leave the game. There is no ""Exit""-Button and the Occulus-Home-Button only leaves you in the entrance-hall of the game. The only way out of the game is by pushing the hardware- button on the helmet, which turns the Occulus completely off. 

Fix this bug, please.



My review for BoxVR (2019):
After two months of using the game intenselly I gave only two stars and wrote this:
""I like the concept of the game: It is easy to learn because there are basically only six ways to punch, one way to block and three ways to duck. Once learned these simple techniques you can play along and work out.
But... as the tracking doesn't work well, it can get very annoying, especially when things are going fast and the fun could be great. The gloves tend to move in mysterious ways, sometimes they move even you do not move your hands, sometimes you move your hands but the gloves don't. Sometimes the gloves disappear at all.
This problem has been commented a lot by many players, but the developers of the game continue to pretend that the players do it all wrong (wrong room-light, wrong hand-position) or they blame it on hardware-issues. I play different games on the Occulus Quest, each more sophisticated than BoxVR (Vader Immortal, BeatSaber, Gun Range) and none of them has such poor tracking though the player can do much more complicated movements. This proves that the poor tracking is a software-problem.
Instead of blaming the hardware or the players the developers should fix the tracking-issues. Than it would be a simple but effective workout-game.""

There has been a system-update of the Quest (not of the Box-VR-Software) in November 2019:  Now the tracking works much better. The gloves stay where they belong and move only when you move the controlers. There is only one minor flaw left: When things get really fast, (for example in ""survival-mode"" around minute 9) the left glove tends to ""fly away"", like it was slipping from your fist. Now it is a great game and cool workout."

If you live in a bad area for wifi connection then you can take your headset with you where the connection is good and then have 3 available download slots to save the 3 workouts offline.

The new game (FitXR) also requires an Internet connection which means I cannot use it in the remote environments that I frequently travel to. Oculus refused to refund my money and the developers have not given me a free copy of BoxVR on the Quest as initially promised. This experience has broken my trust in the Oculus store and I have stopped buying software as a result.]

I've been using this as a warmup for Thrill of the Fight nearly every day of the week for months. It's one of the best fitness applications available on the Quest as it's useful for all ages and abilities. However, there are a few (minor) weaknesses that keep it from getting a five star rating:

1) The biggest flaw is the clunky main menu design. The glove adjustment screen, for example, is seemingly inescapable due to the lack of clear exit instructions.

2) The game could use a few more gym environments. There are currently only three, and one is the same as the other but with dimmer lighting.

3) The game needs a more engaging statistics system. I want more ways to compete against myself. Being able to track my overall progress over time would be great. Show me a high score list and personal combo records for each stage before I begin. Alert me when I'm getting close to breaking a record in-game, or break a record in-game.

4) It would be nice to be able to determine which courses have more squats/dodges.

5) It would be nice to see a track listing for each course, so that I can easily remember them and add them to my custom lesson plans.

All of that aside, BoxVR has a solid core and I would highly recommend it to anyone interesting in getting fit in VR."

I can even do the quick 3 minute boxing workout at lunch and work up a little sweat.  It's something I look forward to doing. Love it when the instructors provide some commentary and moral support. Music is really good, and I like that there are options to be able to workout solo or in a group, and the option to turn squats on and off.  

The 'dance' aerobics is ok, but would be alot better, and more fun if you included some bouncy fun music, maybe even some old 80's, and had some  more moderate level workouts with diverse moves that were easier to follow for all of us who are not well coordinated.

constructive criticism: I almost always go for the boxing.  Some of the 30 minute options have instructors who don't say one word, (and my commentary option is always on).  In addition, some of the 30 minute ish ones allow you to select squats, but have no squats in the work out. It would be nice to know this in advance.  One more, would like the stats to work better.  They don't seem to tally unless you complete the class, and stats show that I never get even one point for 'a streak' in any class which is not correct."

The multiplayer in this joke of a game isn't really even a draw, because you can't even see your competitors.

2466,imagineme,"Sep 10, 2020 at 11:00 AM",1,THIS IS NOT THE GAME I PAID FOR!,"So I initially thought the new updates were cool... until I realised the following
1. Not hitting hard enough breaks your streak. So no room for getting slightly tired during long workouts. It‚Äôs demotivating and I find myself avoiding work out sessions. I did not feel this way with the previous version.
2. I miss the boxing gloves. Now I don‚Äôt even know what this stuff on the hands are...
3. The tracking is buggy. Many times hits are not recorded and if your hands move slightly to the right or left, the camera seems to not capture its location. This means that strong side punches are not recorded.
4. There is not option to change the gym. It‚Äôs dark and it feels unnatural. I like the previous option to change scenery.
5. Playlists are gone!!!
6. The game freezes and pixelates often. I have a screenshot of this...
7. THIS IS NOT THE GAME I PAID FOR!!"

That 1 thing dose does not stop me from recommending the game & the only reason for the 1 star missing."

Be great to do a ""party workout"" or dance as you can now. To socialise whilst doing it

Hi, I am Melody who is enjoying Fit XR. 
I have some questions. The BOX was able to play the game with the person I wanted at the time, but now I'm so sad that The Fit XR just a random match. 
Is this function scheduled? So when will it be updated? 
 And is it possible to apply for Korean language? Many Korean friends bought it for exercise during Cyber Monday sale, but friends who don't know English, especially older people, are having a hard time in the beginning."
2470,Shemham,10/26/2002 0:00,1,Not what I signed up for!,Much preferred rhe app before. Loaded it up today for the first time in a long time to be greeted to a group workout which made no sense to me at all. Logfed out and uninstalled. I should be offered a refund!

2473,JFalcon,"Jul 31, 2020 at 1:02 PM",4,,"I have/had been using BoxVR for several months now as part of my daily routine.  I was starting to get a bit bored, but I feel as if there were some changes that they could have made to improve it and spice it up a bit.

I empathize with the individuals who did not like a completely re-written application switched out for something they were already using and I agree there should have been two versions and I would have happily paid for version 2.0 if I were provided a discount as a BoxVR owner.

That being said, I have tried FitXR and I do like the change of pace, but some features do not seem to exist in this rewrite.  I haven't played it long enough to see if there are achievements yet (I had received all but two on BoxVR), hopefully, they still exist and there are new ones added.

The Good:
 * Added the ability to gauge hit speed, motivates for a more intense workout.
 * New streak goals for extra-strong hits (I feel the goals help motivate gameplay).
 * Ability to turn off squats per class; I have back issues, but missed out on some classes/music in BoxVR due to this.
 * Change of look for targets and environment.  Different, but not for everyone.
 * Haven't run into lockups as I did on BoxVR, especially after long sessions which would then lose my stats.

The Bad:
  * Removal of custom playlists.
  * Removal of setting daily goals for playtime.
  * Only a single environment for playing.
  
What Could Be Better:
  * Bring back custom playlists (show currently playing track).
  * Add a quick button option to add a track to a custom playlist during play.
  * Bring back daily goals for playtime and/or estimated calorie burn.
  * Add more than one boxing environment with different brightness/contrast.
  * Add the ability to change target skins/colors for variety.
  * Provide a 360-degree workout rather than just left/right stance.
  * Allow for special effects and sound event toggles."
2474,SandBear25,"Dec 4, 2020 at 6:44 PM",3,Could be a 5,I really enjoy this game. It's a great workout and fun. So why the 3 star review? This is a health and fitness game. One of it's most important features should be counting calories burned. I mean assuming most people are using this to excercis and maintain or loss weight. The calorie conter is so off on this game I would call it criminal. In a 35 minute work out it's showing 2000 calories burned. While the new fitness tracker on the Oculus 2 is saying around 300. I believe the 300 is accurate. I will change this review to 5 when the calorie counter is fixed. I could see being off like 50 but over 1500? It's like I stated almost criminal...
2475,ForbiddenWhidden,"Nov 18, 2020 at 9:01 AM",5,Yay!,I loved it when it first came out and I love it even more after the major upgrade and addition of dance classes!!!! Super fun. I‚Äôm highly motivated to get in a solid hour of exercise now. Thank you game developers!
2476,McQuiggen,"Oct 15, 2020 at 11:17 PM",3,"Love FITXR, but bugs aren't being fixed","I'm a heavy user of FITXR, as I use it for at least 90 minutes per day, 6 days per week. While I love the game and the workout it gives me, the following bugs and lack of features are making it harder to enjoy:

-When paused, workouts will unpause themselves and start sending notes through the pause screen

- Multiple times per workout, the ""ghost"" members of the workout will appear to throw their controllers across the screen. It is distracting.

-There is no way to favorite a workout, or see your stats for the workout without actually doing the workout and reaching the end screen.

-Half the workouts do not have voiceover from the instructors. If it's not Ianthe, Caroline, Mary, Dillon, or Angel, there is no VO despite having instructors listed

-Certain longer workouts will have portions where there is no music for a minute or two, just punches. And then the workout continues past 0:00 at the end

-I am all for having strong competition, but some of the ghosts they include in the classes are either Floyd Mayweather himself, or they are cheating. I'm talking full combo power streaks in a 45 minute workout with 8.0 m/s average punch speed. Whether or not these are legit, such outliers should not be included

If these things were addressed, my review would be 5 stars. But since I bought the game a month and a half ago, there has been no updates and not much communication from the developer."
2477,dangeek,"Dec 5, 2020 at 9:07 PM",5,Great! Above my expectations,"This is very fun game that makes fitness fun and get you addicted fast.

Please Keep good job and develop for this awesome game."
2478,PlatinumRyan,"Dec 8, 2020 at 5:10 AM",1,NOT For Left Handed People,I purchased this game excited because I wanted a good workout game and I used to box in my youth. There's no way to change what stance you take from what I could tell. I'm left-handed I don't box the way right-handed people box it's a different stance. the settings of the game literally only allow you to adjust the volume no other setting at all. I will be returning this game promptly unless I am corrected about left-handed use.
2479,Portus,"Dec 6, 2020 at 11:22 PM",5,Great fitness game!!,It is totally worthy a 5 star rating - spending as little as 15 minutes each day has boosted my energy levels greatly.
2480,SOYO,"Nov 30, 2020 at 3:18 PM",3,"well-made, but quite unstable","It is good and well-made fitness game, but quite unstable. These are unstable symptoms that I‚Äôve actually seen several times in the game during my playings.

1. TAKE so long to download the exercise contents.
It took so long to download the contents every single time. I have to wait about 5min until starting.

2. ‚ÄòNetwork error‚Äô popped up, and the game was shut down during playing.
In the middle of playing, some message which is unconnected with wifi was popped up even though the wifi connection is working normally. There was only the ‚Äòcontinue‚Äô button so I pushed the continue button, and then, voila, game was shut down.

I miss the old version."
2481,maxfinney,10/27/2002 0:00,5,I love it.,This is great for weight loss. I actually wear a sauna suit while I play this game and in 45 minutes I'm wet through with sweat. Fancy game for fitness and weight loss
2482,Nicole,"Nov 24, 2020 at 9:37 AM",5,Makes working out fun,"I was paying for supernatural but after trying this app, I couldn't go back. This is so much fun. A little difficult to navigate at first but you get the hang of it eventually"
2483,Lundyman,"Nov 14, 2020 at 8:18 AM",3,Frustratingly Hopeful,"I have always been a fan of BoxVR and was soooo stinking excited about this upgrade coming out. Unfortunately I am disappointed after REALLY trying to love it. Overall I‚Äôm confident it will (in time) be amazing but that‚Äôs the problem. I feel there is a long way to go (unless they start pumping out updates pretty quickly). 
Old BoxVR I could happily play for 45-60 mins. This new one I can only go about 15 before losing my patience and stopping. Here‚Äôs why:

- streak counter is not consistent. You can hit an orb the exact same way and it will randomly break your streak (this is guaranteed to happen when multiple orbs come at you quickly)

- Tracking gets messed up A LOT. You can be on a role and then your gloves just float away or disappear or it starts to get ‚Äúchoppy‚Äù and miss. I could almost swear it messes up other games I play after as well. I always have to restart my Quest to fix the patchy tracking afterwards. 

- navigating through the main menu is frustrating. I‚Äôve purchased all the extra music packs and there is no way to simply filter the purchased classes to select one to play. I have to memorize the specific class names and then dig through ALL the workouts to find it. 

I feel if they can get the tracking smooth and flawless and fix the streak inconsistency then it would be the start of something great. Do I want other environments and custom playlists? Yes, but I would honestly be fine in the one environment they have now if I could just get through a workout without interruptions or choppy streaks. I used to get really good workouts in BoxVR and really am losing my interest in the new upgrade. Maybe they released this too soon and should have spent more time on it before making the switch?"
2484,Jared,"Jan 6, 2021 at 2:26 PM",1,Kar smith,Over priced for a minimum work out  for the full experience you need keep buying add ons. Not worth the money at all.

2487,G-MAN,10/9/2002 0:00,4,FitXR,"I was a big fan of the basic VRbox. Was a good ol school get you off your butt and sweat game, not too complicated, didn't have to think too much. Plain , simple and effective. Perfect escape to cram into a busy day. Now enter the conversion to FitXR , better but not, well maybe...
Pros- 
-will make you punch harder and sweat more. 
-cool competitive  class environment. 
-more revolving updated classes
-more interactive experience 

-streak building more accurate, realistic calorie burned measurement mechanisms in place
-------------------------
CONS- and hopefully the developer likes feedback. 

-no background switching , limited mood setting, actually no mood setting at all. 

-streak building almost too difficult especially with  some of the tracking glitches. It's mechanism is almost an uneven playing field. VRBox was too easy to get a 15 min streak going, FitXR almost makes it impossible. 

-WAY TO MUCH EXPLOSION CLUTTER/PARTICLES, when hitting the targets. It does make it vibrant , but also distracting and takes away from an old school training class. Almost 
Reminds me of playing Subway Surfer or Sonic punching away with blings, blangs n sparklers. Needs to be toned down. I want to do fitness , not fineness and Sonic the Hedghog. 

If your new to this , you will really like this game, if hardcore fitness, the pinball /sonic feel may turn u off a-bit after the wow factor is over. 
At the end, you do sweat a lot and have fun. Still DEFINITELY worth the purchase."
2488,Pie_3,"Dec 1, 2020 at 6:28 AM",2,Gets worse with each update,"I am not sure if it‚Äôs a bug with the updates but I can no longer use the app. The download bar stops half way every single time.

2489,hamad,10/3/2002 0:00,2,Nice workout but boring after a while,"In the beginning I enjoined the workout and it's heavy but there is no freedom in the game no modifiers and problem with tracking directional punches I mean if there is modifiers first thing I will do is stopping directional punches
And sometimes I punch hard but nothing happens and I lose my streak
This game needs a lot of tweeks and updates to become a good game
I do not why developers ignoring such big problems but the solution I think it's not hard"
2490,NoSK,"Jan 1, 2021 at 12:10 AM",4,Much improvement since purchase!,"Really enjoying the boxing high levels. 

Definitely seeing a huge improvement since I first bought a quest."
2491,Tabbytha,"Nov 24, 2020 at 2:39 AM",4,Have to unlock videos,Make sure you do the first 3 min video. If you skip this and do all the longer 7 min workouts the  rest of the videos will be grayed out unavailable.  Once you do the 3 min video a lot of workouts open up. Worth the money.
2492,GOHRNiCK,"Oct 27, 2020 at 4:01 AM",5,HUGE improvement!!,"I bought the original BoxVR and it was good for what it was, got me moving in a different way. This new update though.... its a completely different game. I can't believe it was a free! Fantastic workout and the online play really keeps you motivated to be on top of that leader board. Highly recommend this, especially now going into indoor eating season :D"
2493,Sandrarinck,10/23/2002 0:00,1,Problems after problem,"I downloaded it the other day and then bough a pack and it says I purchased it because I did but the pack never downloaded and there's seemingly no way to do it. 

It also crashes a lot.  I haven't been able to get through even 1 entire routine without it freezing or crashing.  

It's extremely disappointing because I don't know how to get my money back or even at least get what I paid for. 

The biggest waste of 40$ yet."
2494,Joek1759,"Oct 23, 2020 at 2:03 AM",2,can no longer play with people we know!,"With the new update we have less choices. My wife and I would box in the same room at the same time and compare each other scores and it motivated us to try harder. The only thing that is harder is getting in the same room , less choices of included workouts and it‚Äôs just not the same playing with people we don‚Äôt know. Please bring back the option to play the older version that we purchased and enjoyed!!! Thank you Joe."
2495,Johannes Blizzl,"Nov 25, 2020 at 9:34 PM",3,"with better tracking, I'd like it more!","So one thing I'll say - I get more sweaty working out with FitXR than with Beat Saber! So I do think it succeeds as a work out app. There are some major issues, and the main one is with the tracking. As in, sometimes (for no reason I can understand) suddenly it just doesn't accept any of your punches for extended periods, rating them as misses and ruining your score. Other times you're in the middle of a good groove, when suddenly one or two are ""missed"", and it seems totally random. At these moments, you see your fist go through the ball, and you clearly did hit it the way that you were meant to but for whatever reason, nope. I don't know if this can be counted as a glitch but if it isn't, I would appreciate it if the tracking could be made less precious, more forgiving; if I encountered the same sort of problems playing Beat Saber, I'd like it a lot less too.

Also I haaaaaate the limited selection of music. But at least you can turn that down."
2496,Belles,"Oct 26, 2020 at 2:34 AM",5,A request for developers,"I actually really enjoy FitXR and do not take the same issues with it that other reviewers do. I also played the former version and can honestly say I enjoy the new program and music just as much if not more. It‚Äôs a great workout either way, so I don‚Äôt understand all the complaints.

I do, however, have one request for developers. It would be cool if there was a ‚Äúshuffle‚Äù option that would just select a class for you. I know it sounds lazy, but I think it would be a neat feature to have."
2497,Sly Stone,"Nov 22, 2020 at 3:39 AM",4,I just tried FitVr,"I just tried FitVR and it seems like a different game than BoxVR. I see what the developers tried to do. But I would have preferred buying this a separate game than losing all that I have worked towards in exchange for a few bells and whistles. Please bring back Box Vr and allow customers this option as either a separate purchase or give them an option in the main screen whenever they access game. 
Either would be preferable. The tracking of my hits after a session was what Forced me to be better than competing with other gamers.

Update 11/21:
I have been playing FitVr for several months and only have one issue. Lately the controllers  fly away from me when trying to hit or it disappears entirely unless I squeeze the trigger to get it back. Not sure if an update caused it to happen. But it makes it difficult to use when ur own high roll of hits and trying to keep up.  Fixing that bug will be huge improvement."

2501,Logos,"Oct 16, 2020 at 2:52 AM",5,New to FitXR,"A lot of the reviews have centered around comparing the older box vr app. I could not get a clear sense of the app on its own through those reviews. Short answer for those of you looking for a fitness app; this is a good choice.

I wanted something that could get me to move with some intention - and provide a platform that gave me more of a workout ‚Äúfeel‚Äù than other games set to music. This app accomplishes this goal very well. Classes include other real people and are more than just one song (8 and 15 minute long workouts are available).

Yes, there are additional content packages for more money - but if they are as well thought out as the basic package, there is a reason for it. This is not just punching to a beat (and yes, it is somewhat that) - it is a short exercise routine with an intensity goal in a class session.

Looking to exercise in VR? This is a great choice."
2502,0GGFTW0,"Nov 23, 2020 at 8:44 AM",3,Cannot connect to server,"If you want to play, make sure you select solo.

2504,JRH,10/16/2002 0:00,2,I wish this had just been a sequel,I miss BoxVr. There are some good changes but a lot of that comes at the expense of the charm and functionality BoxVr had. FitXr feels a little simplified. It sucks that this all just overwrote the original completely.
2505,Ketsaiga,"Oct 14, 2020 at 7:50 PM",5,Workout Fun,"Been playing Beat Saber between running. I thought that was a good casual workout. Decided I wanted something similar to swap between so as not to get bored, and wow. FitXR is more intense than Beat Saber for sure. My wife and I are loving it, plus it is way more fitness oriented, and we love the multiplayer matchmaking for workouts to give us that extra motivation to reach the high score against others doing the same class. Highly recommend for fitness."
2506,Piotr,"Nov 18, 2020 at 5:26 AM",5,#1 Go To Exercise App,This is my favorite app whenever I need a quick workout. I always end up sweating and out of breath. I got it months ago and I still pay it and that really means something.
2507,Vino,"Oct 23, 2020 at 6:31 AM",5,Hard core fitness app,I started this and definitely feel the purpose of this. I think they should include more squats to equate with upper body. This app feels more on upper body workout than lower body but we need to think about playability as well. So this is a truly hard core work out game. I‚Äôll sure use it more and let‚Äôs see the result after few months.
2508,Pooh Creative,"Sep 21, 2020 at 9:02 AM",1,I hate it,I bought the game as boxVR after trying a friends and I loved it. The new changes made it a different game that is not fun. The multiplayer is creepy the way it‚Äôs setup. The load screen being in the gym was great now it‚Äôs plain and boring. It doesn‚Äôt play offline. If u aren‚Äôt swinging with all your might u cannot get a streak...just hitting it on time does not count. Not everyone can swing with hella force. My mom can no longer play and the music selection sucks now. I have nothing but complaints as this is NOT what I paid for. Removed from Quest and replaced with another game. Garbage!

2512,Peter,"Sep 25, 2020 at 6:34 PM",2,Very disappointed !,As one of the first subscribers to Box Xr. I was excited to experience the new version.  OMG What a let down!   There are so many bugs with the scoring it drives me crazy especially with the Best Streak!  It continually resets to zero.  I suggest not playing multiplayer and stick with solo otherwise the game will frustrate you.  The scenes are extremely boring compared to the original BoxXR.  Developers let‚Äôs get moving with some changes.  Otherwise you are going to lose your base really fast.
2513,David,"Oct 4, 2020 at 9:17 PM",1,Changed game,"I think that since they changed completely the game, reviews before that change should have been wiped out. Most recent reviews say that they want the old version, so I'm assuming the new one is worse.

I say I'm assuming because now they require you to give then an email, but the original one didn't. This means a change in the original requirements to play, and I don't want to have to keep track of another email for another account that I shouldn't have to create."

I've had knee problems recently, so it's nice to be able to turn those off for a couple weeks, but still feels like a more complete workout when on. The music is good, although it's like a little more variety in the sessions. Some music genres don't have any options in the duration/intensity setting you need. There are a good variety of options in the base game, but I did buy one music pack after having spent 40+ hours in the game and that gave it some extra variety. Great workout at the level you choose, with the music you choose."

I didn‚Äôt own boxvr, so perhaps it was a big deal, but the current environment is fine. Not to mention I didn‚Äôt buy this for environments, I bought it for cardio.

I own an Apple Watch which when activated will monitor my heart beat during the exercise session. I am blown away at the results. In a session, my average is 165 beats per minute. The highest heart beat I‚Äôve gotten to is 197. This tells you how great this workout app is, and how great of an alternative it is to running, especially for those people who can‚Äôt run like myself due to a medical issue.

This app will make you work for it. It will make you sweat and it will tire you out. I am very impressed. It has different levels of classes. Light, moderate, and intense. It has different class lengths. There are many options to choose from.

If you‚Äôre searching for a great workout app look no further."

Its just replaced with this goofy thing that is NOWHERE near as good. Bring BOX VR back for those of us who paid for it... and let whatever the heck this weird thing is be it‚Äôs own thing.

This is not a game update. It‚Äôs a game conversion!

I paid for Box VR, not a watered down version of Audioshield. 

Box VR was great!  Simple and easy! The ability to customize your workouts depending on your mood and energy level on any particular day made it even better! It quickly became my go to for cardio very soon after I bought it. All those months of customizing workouts and tracking progress are now gone. 

I want Box VR. I would have never paid $30 for Fit XR.  I think it‚Äôs highly unethical for a developer to do what they just did. This is definitely not what I and  others, based of other comments, have paid for. 

Bring back Box VR or give us back our $30."

There are two major drawbacks for me. 

The variation within a levels is huge. I play Moderate 10-15 minute levels. Some have a nice beat going and good flow, others literally have hook after hook and crazy amounts of punches. I just wish there was more consistency.

It‚Äôs sometimes glitchy with punch impact. I love the scoreboard motivation but noting is more of a piss off than when you punch harder than a previous punch and you don‚Äôt keep a streak, or when your punch literally goes through the target and it counts as a miss. I think just a better ‚Äúwhat did a do wrong‚Äù messaging would be cool.

Unfortunately,  what a letdown.  No choice of stage, lost all ability to make a custom workout using the songs available, a more restricted (i think?) Total number of songs. All survivable but the game itself is worse. The loss of a streak if you don't get the hook or uppercuts dead on would be less irritating if they had fixed the glitches above. But they seem as bad as ever. The exploding coloured rings are fine on lighter workouts but in the more intense ones , there are so many on the screen that you can't see what is coming next. I got a headache after an 11 minute intense session, where I had been happily doing 50 minute sessions in box vr. 
The punch strength meter is a nice touch, as is the multiplayer but overall this is a downgrade. I hope the developers have plans to reintroduce the elements that boxvr had  or I can see my go to for daily exercise changing."

2544,decoy_effect,"Aug 1, 2020 at 4:44 AM",3,"Was great, now less so","With today‚Äôs update I‚Äôm really disappointed in the direction BoxVR, and their parent co FitXR are taking. BoxVR was a cardio boxing app disguised as a rhythm game - with the official move to FitXR they‚Äôre taking an opposite approach in my opinion - by making a rhythm game and disguising it as ‚Äúfitness‚Äù by revamping and prioritizing certain things in the HUD and UI.

Prior BoxVR was great at what it was meant to be - prioritizing seeing your calories, time remaining and landed punches - all in large equal size. FitXR‚Äôs prioritization of a 1 million point font size score, minuscule time clock, no calorie counter, large leaderboard and counter intuitive ‚Äústreak‚Äù counter is all for the sake of making a it more of a game and less of a steam-lined cardio workout.

Honesty this current version feels like a beta of what BoxVR was - the menus attempt to be pretty but bog down navigation unnecessarily; the beat saber-esque giant score board try to make it game-y, but it‚Äôs overkill - and limiting as we want from 3 back drops to 1; and for the first time after weeks of using BoxVR in long sessions (40-60 min) - this new UI made me feel nauseous. If this continues not sure I can keep using the app as my shelter-in-place workout.

Layer in the lame attempt at getting user data by now requiring an email to start and not porting over any existing info from BoxVR - I‚Äôm not as jazzed on this program as I once was - and feel good that I didn‚Äôt invest in the DLC.

The few positive changes include:

1. the updated block mechanic is much better
2. better general tracking and punch recognition

Note that while punch recognition is better, it is completely unclear on what types of punches count toward the new ‚Äústreak‚Äù counter. As mentioned it‚Äôs counter intuitive predominantly in name, as it doesn‚Äôt track your consecutive hits, it counts specific hits. Just what hits exactly I‚Äôm clear as there appears to be no rhyme or reason to how to trigger the ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù animation.

Honestly FitXR just deleted BoxVR - the game many of us paid for - and bait and switched to this version - which I might not have purchased. I‚Äôd appreciate it if FitXR gave us all BoxVR back as a free app in its last form. They didn‚Äôt pull this bait and switch on PSVR or Steam VR - as BoxVR is still their perfect their website - not sure why us."

2550,auxilium,"Jul 31, 2020 at 7:18 PM",1,This update is not what we wanted,"I was so happy to hear that an overhaul update was coming to this game as it was argueably needed.  However I didnt realize that meant making the game functionally worse and less customizable.  No more custom playlists, zero effort made into importing your own music, now everything is find an instructor, pick ONE genre if music.  There are threads scattered across the net asking and begging for implementing custom songs and yet nothing.  I can't recommend a game when features are taken out as opposed to being refined and made in addition too. This comes off tone death to those who have been playing it since the beginning, why would I want to continue to support your studio? Don't buy, updates take too long, and they take more away than they put in.  All you needed to do was add some more basic functionality, skip songs, improve response times, and a better interface for moving songs around the playlists. Thanks for the better graphics but was anyone paying attention to the user base?

Health risks?
Everything is dangerous, I'm sure if someone played rockband long enough they'd hurt their fingers or ears.  I'm sure carpal tunnel is a risk of almost every long term gamer.  Heck seizures are a potential threat to anyone who looks at a screen.  Throw up the disclaimer at the beginning of the game, there's already a TOS that has to be checked off by the user.  Sorry I'll buy that you weren't happy with the previous algorithm, but I doubt the health risks were something that should be seriously considered by anyone other than through disclaimers.  Also I don't understand and forgive my ignorance, I don't see the correlation between your team not liking the previous playlist algorith, and me being able to create my own.  Appreciate the response, good luck on future endeavors."

This has quickly become my favorite way to do cardio. I actually think the updated version is pretty cool. 

If I had it my way, and to get 5-stars, I‚Äôd love to see the following improvements:

2561,MSM,"Sep 16, 2020 at 5:54 PM",1,No playlist is a Deal Breaker,"I liked to work out with my own playlists in BoxVR. Removal of the playlists is a deal breaker. The problem is the deal was made months ago when I purchased the app. That feature was a big reason I purchased the app to begin with. The company says they removed it because only a small number of people used the feature. So is this how the Oculus platform works? Developers can retroactively remove features that existed at the time of purchase? If it is, then I'll be wary of making future purchases.  The company also says they removed playlists because they could pose a health risk to players. I don't even know what this means exactly. I've been an adult for awhile; I can handle a playlist. Right now, the app I purchased is gone, replaced with one I don't want.

Response to response: The gist of the matter is I no longer have the app I purchased. That's all that matters. It doesn't matter if the new app is superior. It doesn't matter that you might bring features back you took away. It doesn't matter if it will have better functionality. None of that matters. The only thing that matters is that I paid for BoxVR and now I have FitXR, which I never would have paid for."
2562,Facebook1,"Oct 20, 2020 at 12:26 PM",2,Way to low frame rate to be accurate.,The concept is good and I think it is great executed. But it all falls due to the low framerate. I feels like the balls are moving in like have the refresh rate wich makes it hard to know exactly to punch. I also tried the older version(I guess) with the Rift S on my PC. That one also have issues with un even frame rate. So unfortunally this is unplayable for me until there is some sort of optimizations made. Other Quest games have more content going on and seems to have a fluid experience.
2563,nick,10/4/2002 0:00,2,Not a fun workout experience,"I want to like this app but the most frustrating thing about is how hard it is to figure out what a ""good"" hit is. Whether you hit the lights or not at times seems completely random: Sometimes you miss what *felt* like a perfect hit, and what at first looks like miss for some reason turns into a hit but behind you?? This mechanic turns FitXR into a game of chance rather than skill.

Developers, please either add more in-game feedback in the form of prompts and/or points on how you can get more accurate hits or make the incoming lights more reactive to my actual hand movement rather than the vague combination of direction/position you seem to be employing now."

2577,Kaxiniz,"Nov 2, 2020 at 12:46 AM",3,Scoring mechanics,"First off, I wanted to say great job on a well rounded game. The devopers have done a fantastic job just as any developer. 

The game does what it says it will do, it gives you a decent cardio workout. The layout is easy to pick up, the visuals are fantastic. I HAVE noticed people complaining about only one environment to play in, which as every human being is different, that does make sense. For me personally, I love the environment you have and probably would use that one anyways. The music is full of life and keeps you going. 

The only realy gripe I have, and forgive me because I hate to gripe about a game/software especially when I couldn't do any better. I have read other reviews before purchasing the game that stated you have to put so much power into your punches and after playing myself, I honestly feel that is a terrible mechanic to judge the scoring.

I understand the reasoning behind it, however, for the average person that is quite demotivating. I also hate when people just complain instead giving a ""possible"" solution. I love the power hits, but maybe instead of being the source of streaks, leave the streaks for actually hitting the orbs. You could easily use the power mechanic to add a multiplier to the score for people that wish to go for maximum score and leave the streaks to the orbs themselves for the people that like to lose themselves in the workout and not have to look up every 15 seconds to find they restarted their streak, even when they've hit every one.

Obviously, this is just my opinion.  My other problem is the multi-player function. More of a question, but will there EVER be an option of running a game with a friend so you can workout together and use it to compete with a friend as well, not just this whole random ghost player thing. 

Anyways, all in all I would honestly give this a 5 or 6 star application, but because of the demotivating aspect of the scoring system, it honestly makes me subject this app to a 3 star. Otherwise, keep up the fantastic work."

Today I tried to hit the targets just a little lighter so I don't get the halos as they are both distracting and they trigger my motion sickness...fun fact...if you don't get a halo it doesn't count and, although I missed 1, I had a 0 streak. I even checked my gloves thinking I must have put them on incorrectly. You have managed to completely destroy everything good and enjoyable about this game in one fell swoop. I want a refund!"
2583,Comradeski,"Sep 30, 2020 at 12:30 AM",5,I use this for every workout,"With covid times raging on and not wanting to visit an actually gym - I use FitXR for every workout session simply because I can do it in my living room and I know it will give me a good workout. I know this because I wear a WHOOP fitness strap and all my sessions of 45 minutes on intense intensity result in over 600 calories burned. It's more fun than most other stationary workouts I would normally do such as  stationary bike or treadmill. Its probably do only VR game that actually makes me break a sweat. I've probably had at least 20 half-hour workouts in this app. Seriously, sometimes I can't even finish a 45-min session because my heart is absolutely racing.

I like the music although obviously would wish for more as it does get a bit repetitive.

I don't like how there are pictures of various trainers yet you only hear the same woman's voice and she doesn't say much except ""Nice streak!"" and ""Punch speed increased""

I'd also like to there to be different environments, possibly one with more than just a black void.

If you really want a good workout, I highly recommend FitXR"

Thanks developers for reaching out and being so helpful to explain."
2585,Joe chin,"Oct 27, 2020 at 2:34 AM",1,Hope a competitor comes along soon.,"This experience is simultaneously great and frustrating for me. I have quickly and easily added it to my workouts as a good way to work up a sweat before lifting weights. 

Criticisms:
I hate that there is no option to enable vibrations on the controls so that there is some feedback when you hit a target. 
No song customization options. 
No way to design your own stage. 
The game stutters sometimes. 
Only 3 environments are available.


This game frustratingly feels like something the developer built as a business but not something that they built out of love."
2586,Ana,"Aug 1, 2020 at 7:25 PM",1,Give me my money or give me my app,"Enter the gym. Calibrate your gloves. Pick your class by skill & duration. Pick your gym setting. BOX!

That‚Äôs what I bought for $30.

Now my gym is gone! In its place is some fantasy land video game setting, gone are my boxing gloves, along with the haptics that made the air punches so satisfying.

Easy to see targets to punch have been replaced by video game graphics.

The WHOLE PREMISE of the game has changed. Why on earth the devs trashed a successful and well-loved product instead of adding FitVR as an additional app boggles the mind.

Update: I am puzzled as to why they decided to retire the game that appealed to so many, only to forfeit revenue they would have earned had they simply ADDED FitVR to their dev repertoire/library, so that BoxVR remained the wonderful boxing workout so many paid for and enjoyed (and still available for sale and use), and then offer FitVR as a separate app/game in the Oculus store. 

It appears that there are a lot of people who like this new app/game, so I‚Äôm sure you could have made a pretty penny by selling it as a separate product to them and other Oculus users who may wish to buy both programs, since they are so different.

For me, you just stole one of my favorite VR experiences. It‚Äôs like I bought a crossword game and one day I wake up and the devs turned it into sodoku.

I already have apps that are like what FitVR is aiming for, so I never would have bought this.

This was NOT an update!

This was a murder of a fantastic app which was then replaced with a pathetic imposter.

So either give me my money back or my app back, you can‚Äôt take both!

They‚Äôve ruined it!,"Don‚Äôt you love it when the devs think you‚Äôre too stupid to know they‚Äôre just trying to shaft you for as much money as they can possibly get? Maybe some people ARE that clueless: after all, Zuckerberg apparently bragged as such when he was starting Facebook. Do the devs think we‚Äôre too stupid to know that when they now *require* our email addresses to even use the app in the first place, they‚Äôre doing this for their own marketing purposes? Even with the option to later unsubscribe, by that time they can easily have sold our information to partner companies? Do they think we‚Äôre too idiotic to know that they‚Äôre not asking for our age and weight for the good of our health, but for the targeting of specific advertisements? Do they think we‚Äôre so stupid that we don‚Äôt even know our own gender, so that they now have to offer a third option? Do they think we‚Äôre so clueless that when they casually strip away our previous options (no longer do we have the option to create our own playlist, no longer do we have the option to choose from a variety of workout venues, we‚Äôre now forced to use the one lame venue they provide, a dark ugly room; no longer do we have a huge choice of workouts, no longer can we calibrate our gloves and the various colors used, they‚Äôve completely taken those options from you ‚Äî options you had originally paid for), do they think we‚Äôre so stupid that when they totally strip away some of the best features of the game, they won‚Äôt eventually offer them back to us... for a new fee? In other words, we‚Äôll get to re-pay for what we‚Äôve already paid for. This is a con. They‚Äôre apparently under a new management model, and in their meetings they‚Äôve apparently brainstormed for the fastest and cleverest ways to maximize their profits, at your expense.  CONCLUSION: Yes, they think we‚Äôre that stupid. This is more than an update, it‚Äôs a complete paradigm shift. This isn‚Äôt what I paid for.

2594,Ositodefelpa,"Aug 25, 2020 at 8:28 PM",1,Unprincipled and Buggy,"They took a 4-5 star product with some flaws and forced its replacement with a feature-reduced, buggy mess of a game. No doubt they can point to some lawyer's language in their T&C, which says they're allowed to do what they did, but it's just plain unethical. I had a game I could play replaced with this unplayable garbage. It is a triumph of form over substance, as they say.

Also, the calorie counter is so broken that I wonder whether Trading Standards or Public Health should be taking a look at it. It is incredibly damaging if people think they really burnt 100 calories in a 5 minute session. That's right, according to FIT-XR, I burn 1200 calories per hour!

I have one question. You promised we could have BOX-VR back. When?"
2595,bap75075,"Oct 12, 2020 at 12:53 AM",3,Good. Could be better with minor fixes.,"I originally had this game on Steam VR and decided I wanted to get the oculus version so I didn't have to virtual desktop each time. I prefer the Steam VR version despite this nicer graphical overhaul. I'll start with the bad. The steam VR versional also allows you to create your own workouts at various fitness with the tracks included. I was unable to locate this feature. A lot of the reviews are spot on about the streaks being a source of contention. A hard hit streak needs to be differentiated from a regular streak as they are different things and can be highly discouraging. This is at its core a cardio game where it's not always feasible to swing your hardest but sticking it out to the end of long sessions should be rewarded accordingly. Now for the good. The graphically overhaul is nice. As can be the trainer encouragement if you're into that sort of thing or if you don't like it you can turn it off as is my preference. Also if you like the concept of competing against other people that is an option as well. Doesn't appeal to me however your mileage will vary. Overall this game could be really great if you could incorporate elements of the pre existing game into this one, but right now it's merely a solid work in progress."
2596,Luca,"Oct 26, 2020 at 8:28 AM",3,Good fitness but boring fast,"I am ambivalent towards this app.
The graphics are simple and it‚Äôs extremely easy to use and scale up to the desired intensity and duration levels.
You can set up a full fitness routine with this, no kidding.
The system is based on you punching balls that are coming your way at increasing speed and show which angle to use to punch them, there are even bars that fly towards you forcing you to squat vertically or laterally.
All of this following gym-style music in an environment which is always looking like a one way digital highway, and herein lies the real problem of this app.
The lack of diversity in the setting and the music can make it boring fast.
While there is nothing you can do about the setting (hopefully the developers will add a way to change scenery soon...) you can purchase additional music.
This is not the typical top-chart music you would listen to at the radio however. This is all off-chart music.
The fact that you have to even pay for this additional music is for me questionable.
Start adding top-charts music please and I‚Äôll be more than glad to pay for extra packages.
An app that is boring by design meaning that you will feel forced to buy additional packages after a couple of weeks if you use it as your everyday fitness routine (I do).
Be extra careful: you will sweat. A lot. The quest‚Äôs materials are not made to take this much; buy extra masks and wear a band on your head. They should actually sell special packages with proper equipment. This can become a serious fitness appliance and deserves better quality materials."

It's fun and again challenging at first, I feel that I will eventually not get the proper challenge after a few weeks.  To further challenge my body, I've decided to use a weighted vest and that kicked it up a notch. Try it everyone. 

What I would like to see in the future is to have some type of fitness dial so that I can up the speed and tempo of the target coming at me. The developers should not treat this app with the same fitness level for everyone. Just add a way to rate yourself as novice, normal, or advance in fitness level and have the classes automatically change the speed/tempo for each workout."

2604,JimBob,"Aug 1, 2020 at 3:34 AM",1,What did you guys do?,"I've been robbed.  BoxVR (what this was) was my absolutely most favorite app on the Oculus, and a primary part of my fitness regimen.  I loved the feel, and the content.  Now with FitXR, this is no update, this is throw the baby out and replace it will a doll.  I might somehow tolerate the complete loss of user account and accumulated data (I've been using it for months, all gone, just like a new app).  I might somehow tolerate the loss of setting/scenes for no apparent reason.  I could tolerate cluttering it up with multi-player functionality that I won't use, but maybe somebody will.  I might even trade many things off for the new content you've made available (I assume for purchase) since there hasn't been any since March.  But you also took the haptic feedback/vibration away.  Sure, it might be cool to have hand tracking, but that controller feedback was the only thing that provided sensation of a punch, and it made a world of difference in engagement.  And you didn't have the forethought to consider leaving any of this old functionality in place for someone who may have been enjoying it, or providing any mechanism to turn controller vibration back on.  I turned this off after about 6 minutes today, and don't even want to see it anymore.  I will complain to Oculus and try to get my money back, because an update this big has robbed me of the purchase I enjoyed.  I would have returned this version in a heartbeat.  This was such a radical change I'm not even sure I'm keeping my Quest at this point.  If the Quest Appstore allows you to totally kill a purchase this radically, then there is no sense in investing.  This wasn't an update.  This was an app switch."

2606,Barelos,"Sep 6, 2020 at 3:35 PM",1,Great game with mechanics that ruins it,"To the devs, create two game mods, aerobics and strength.
Set the explosive value appropriately I.e in aerobics to get an explosive hit the user needs to use less strength.
You must understand as game developers that your users must have some milestones to aspire to. You can‚Äôt really have a full combo in a 46 minutes workout and that is missing from the game. Also you must understand that there are technical limitations to the tracking via IR cameras. You must leave us users some leeway because the last thing you want is for a user to loose a perfect streak in the last minute of the game to lost tracking.
Another option is to let the user choose difficulty and the difficulty will effect the explosiveness threshold.
Long story short, you are not training people for the Olympic, let us control the difficulty.
If you are reading this review and thinking this is just another person complaining that a game is to hard, I regularly do triathlons and I use this app to have some nice relaxed training without much strain on my joints, in the current state of the game I can‚Äôt really achieve this goal."

It did what it promised, gave good value for the money, offered a choice of very pleasant environments. It had a few minor bugs, but nothing big. It offered in app purchases of custom workout sessions if you wished, but the ones that came with the game were quite good. There were short sessions and sessions that were as long as twenty minutes. All in all, a very nice application and if you read the old reviews you‚Äôll see that people liked it a lot. 

Then something happened. As a user, it seems as though they sold out to a slick marketing company that knows more about how to mine your information and in-app purchases than they do about building a good application.The long sessions are gone, replaced by little more than warm-ups. You can pay quite a bit more for longer sessions, but keep in mind that you already paid $30 for this app. The choice of environments is gone and in its place is a dark, amateurish cluster of oversized graphics that don‚Äôt tell you what you want to know. The calorie counter is gone - WTF??? and time clock is nearly invisible. Instead you‚Äôve got a massive leader board and ‚Äústreak‚Äù counter as if they don‚Äôt even understand that this is a workout app, not a FPS. 

There are so many things to dislike in this app, that it is really hard to list them all, but one of the most outrageous is that the fireworks that you get from a good hit, complete obscure the following targets. 

The worst thing about the switch from BoxVR to FitXR is that they did it without my consent. It isn‚Äôt an upgrade, it is a different application - and not a very good one.

I love being able to make custom playlists and despite some issues here and there it's an overall great game as BOXVR!! If you haven't updated it yet then I recommend you don't. After reading all the reviews post update it has made me 100% weary of updating the game. No custom playlists? No access to previously purchased DLC? No thank you. On top of that it sounds like none of the real issues that were in the original were fixed at all, rather it seems like they were made worse. So no thank you I'll keep my game out of date as BoxVR until the devs correct all these things and ACTUALLY LISTEN to the long running fan base who has been enjoying their game and offering good feedback. I watched this game rating drop quickly in only a few hours and it's all due to the new update. So devs I recommend you take a good look at that and ask yourselves what the hell happened. I strongly recommend you offer people who enjoyed the original game a chance to revert and then go from there.

Update: So my game updated itself last night despite me constantly telling my quest not to update. I want my money back!! I want the old BoxVR back! The devs took a fun and exciting game that allowed me to get my cardio in and have fun while doing and just took a huge elephant sized crap on it!! FitXR is NOT the game I bought, I paid for BoxVR and enjoyed it as it was despite its shortcomings. Now I have the absolute pain of a game that is bland and in no way shape or form what I had paid for. The immediate difference I noticed was the way the streaks were registered originally your streak continued as long as you hit the notes, now you have to absolutely wail on every note in order to continue your streak. The devs say they removed custom playlists for health and safety reasons, then explain to me how making someone put a lot force into every single punch in order to maintain their streak is healthy? It isn't! I bought BoxVR as a way to supplement my martial arts training during the pandemic, unfortunately the dojo I trained at ended having to permanently close. So I still felt a small glimmer of hope since I could do this in my free time to continue some elements of my training like striking targets and focusing on my footwork as I did so. It was nice because I don't have access to a training partner so this was a nice alternative, at least until the takeover. So devs instead giving me some generic response I want a full refund for the base game and the 2 DLC packs I bought because I didn't buy FitXR I bought BoxVR."

This is a wildly disappointing downgrade from BoxVR.  BoxVR had some issues but, I really liked it.  I would like to have seen the developer fix the glitchiness with blocks, dodges and tracking hiccups that made your fists pass through targets you hit spot on.  I was able to assemble custom playlists of songs that didn‚Äôt have annoying sequences where you had to dance instead of throwing real punches.  I got to choose music I wanted from a fairly large catalog.  I liked the nice, plain, brightly-lit gym environment.

FitXR does away with the custom playlists.  You can do the ‚Äúclasses‚Äù they provide and, that‚Äôs it.  It does away with the bright, plain gym environment in favor of a cyberpunk video game scape.  You get an annoying trainer voice distracting you.  Apparently, there are some new ‚Äúsocial‚Äù features.  I‚Äôm not really looking for ‚Äúsocial‚Äù in my VR workouts.

In other news, they suddenly need your birthdate and email address so they can attach your game/workout data to your actual identity and, use it for marketing purposes.  That‚Äôs also not an improvement.

I feel like I finally found a gym I liked and, it just closed down.

I see the developer responding to critical reviews with a cut-and-paste response.  It‚Äôs great that you are going to keep working on things but, find a way to let users switch back to the previous BoxVR version until you can get something we don‚Äôt hate.

UPDATE: I gave it another try and, figured out that you can turn off the annoying trainer voice.  You have to pause a class after you start and, there is a box you can uncheck.  That should be in the settings, too.

Trying several more ""classes,"" I remain disappointed and sad.  It was possible to use BoxVR in a way that really engaged your core.  This new thing is more like a low-impact dance game where you wave your hands around."
2623,Maxican,"Sep 12, 2020 at 5:35 AM",5,I like the update more,"I like this game. I got so into this it is great fitness gaming as a qualified trainer and instructor myself it felt familiar to a class but without all the pausing for instructions. This game just flows through a decent workout intuitively making me punch harder to count toward points and streaks kept my intensity up, some combos are harder for myself but not being able to see past a block made me stumble at times. The calorie count can't be accurate I've entered the correct weight but in a 45 minute workout it reckons I've burned 1400 calories I'd love it to be true and it feels like a 45 minute sprint but there is just no way I would burn 1400 calories in 45 minutes and still be standing haha.

There‚Äôs no preview option to even the style of music, all it says music varies.

All I really wanted was a fix to the hitbox detection and some polish. But the new FitXR is NOT the game I paid for. Very lacking in substance, only a few songs, calorie counter is way off, and worse of all, forced internet connection. I've tried several workouts, and everyone was a bot. What's the point of multiplayer if no one else is there? And what if my internet is out, am I supposed to loaf about? A shiny UI means nothing if the game is crap. I'm going to try for a refund with very little hope for success. Seems like BoxVR found a way to fail one more time.

UPDATE: Just so everyone is aware, the developer lied in their response. If you turn your wifi off (simulating no internet connection), the game is grey out in your library with a message that internet connectivity is required. No matter what you download. Notice how they didn't address the bots either?  

Corporate overlord speak does not fix a game, nor give refunds to the customers whom you've stolen from.

And this is not working to make the best game, this is working to lay the groundwork for a microtransaction laden and a subscription-based blight on VR gaming.  Be careful folks, this is how the EAs of the  gaming world get started."

Now they implemented this feature. But they deleted many others. Ability to change the gloves orientation? Gone. I need this badly because I use the controllers with the rings upside down.

I put new batteries in, unpaired and re-paired my left controller, and although my glove is flying off less, it *still* does it. I am not sure if I should take comfort in seeing other people's glove fly off during the workout or not;  I think it just aggravates me more that the product doesn't work.

I have another question... the tracking for counting the hits made/strike feels off. Also I would like to know what I am not connecting with so that I can improve. Is there a way to look at what I am missing and tell me how to correct. Or can I get a tip for how to successfully block? That seems to be when the counter resets a lot even though I am getting the audio fdbk for correctly connecting something. I'm at a loss. Also the color of the right glove - when you really connect and it makes that fire color - I keep trying to do that with my left glove, but I think it doesn't make that color. I think it makes a different shade of blue, is that correct?

2635,Georgiana,"Jul 31, 2020 at 10:02 AM",1,Not happy with the new version!,"The new version isn't the app I paid for just a couple of weeks ago! And while I'm all for improvements, I feel cheated because many things have been removed. 

BoxVR was my favorite workout, although it had plenty of issues. This completely redesigned app took care of some of those issues but unfortunately removed many fan favorites! 


Let downs/ deal breakers: 

- boxing gloves are gone, which was one of my favorite features! 

- the streak meter in my opinion is broken, the count starts all over if you don't hit perfectly. This is not fair, either you hit it or you don't. It is not motivating me anymore!

- I don't care for the ONE environment. I miss the bright gym space from before, which was the only one I used. Many other users asked for additional spaces, developers took all away! 

- the bulk of the workouts is gone, there are very few now. 

- it's difficult to see the time left in a workout. 

- is it me or the hits aren't synchronized to the music? Not sure yet as I've only done a couple of workouts today, this complete overhaul took me by surprise. BoxVR had a few incredible workouts with the hits right on the beat and I loved it even though I didn't actually like the songs. Now it feels random, without thought put into it. Again, not motivating! 


Yes, there have been improvements:

- finally having the ability to add favorite workouts. Finally! 

- the ability to turn off squats with the push of a button (I LOVE the squats, but sometimes I'm too sore). 

- the redesigned blocks, which are now smaller and half half colored. 

- the ability to choose type of music and level of difficulty (although I'm not sure how accurate this is and where are all the songs?!)

- finally having access to user past performance, although still missing number of missed hits (which currently would be irrelevant considering the meter is broken and not actually counting hits!)

The point of an improvement is to add new features, not to remove options! Incorporate the features taken away or I'm asking for my money back!"

2637,TimothyPayne,"Sep 18, 2020 at 2:38 AM",2,Updated Review!,"Originally released as BoxVR, FitXR is a completely revamped experience. 

In short, there are a few nice additions, but the total package is a huge step backwards. 

Hand Tracking

Issues:
Hand tracking is still frustrating, as hooks and uppercut often whiff (missing the intended target). This is worsened by a new streak system which ideally rewards speed and accuracy with a higher streak count. Unfortunately, due to the poor tracking, this system becomes discouraging as too often streaks are interrupted by whiffs and floating hands. In the previous build, I often wondered if it was a problem with my Quest headset or touch controllers, but thanks to the new update, I have observed other user's hands floating away during classes. It's annoying that the developers would further emphasize accuracy without first fixing the core mechanics.
Possible Solutions:
Jabs and crosses seem to track well, however, hooks and uppercuts do not track as well. I suggest increasing the hitbox for hooks and uppercuts. The point is to workout and have fun, so the developers should focus more on facilitating that. Again, it is very discouraging to have a long streak break after timing a punch  properly. If the hardware is not able to track certain movements with 100 percent accuracy, do not make that a core mechanic in building streaks as that will only lead to frustration. 

Game Mechanics

Issues:
Players can increase their score by throwing downward hammerfists. Two days ago I start playing ‚Äúsolo‚Äù and find it to be a more enjoyable experience (and less distracting). 

Possible Solutions:
It would be fantastic if this game encouraged proper form. For example, the developers could add a ‚Äúcombo multiplier‚Äù if the user keeps their hands up in between punches. The system should also emphasize and reward properly turning over punches (rotation)... I have more to say, but have exceeded the maximum character limit."
2638,Nateo,"Sep 8, 2020 at 12:15 AM",5,(Still) Worth the money :),"Review update by SeaHaych after 'FitXR' mod.

So, I know some people are morally outraged at the conversion of BoxVR to FitXR, but the concept is unchanged; get fit to a beat. It would have been nice to have been informed that it was such a radical visual update though; maybe I missed the office memo? I always liked the 'Gym' (it made me feel like I was 'sticking it to the man by having a Gym membership I wasn't paying for :D.
I like the fact we can 'compete' online with individual profiles if more than one of us share the Quest in the household. I also like the addition of the ghosts; it's a smart way to 'compete' against others, although it would be nice to know if you were actually competing against any real players (with ghosts filling any vacant slots) because playing against someone's ghost is not the same as going toe-to-toe with them in real time). Also, their scores update after the session's completed, so you can think you're ahead by 5000 points, and then find you've been beaten into third.

DEVs. I still love it, but here's my suggestive feedback
1) It would be good to add a calorie modifier to each profile. Just done a 16 minute session: FitXR estimated 717 kCals burnt, but it was actually only 215Cals (so I burnt ~1/3 of the calories FitXR advertised)
2) Can we have a settings option to turn off, or reduce, the frequency of Ms Motivator's comments? PLEASE!
3) Any chance we can get the option back to build our own routines
4) Not sure if the glove contact mechanics have changed but, like others, the timing seems a bit off, but maybe it's just me 
Cheers.

OP (for Box VR):
Ok. So I'm a middle aged (late forties), average kind of guy. I like to be active and although I'm not a fitness freak, I start to feel a bit 'meh' if I don't get the old heart pumping at least once a week. So, having read all the lowest star reviews (that's the way I roll), I still thought I'd give this a go. I'm glad I did; I've been sweating on it daily! I have had the occasional tracking miss on the left hand, but my daughter has had misses on the right, so I think it's down to hand to headset positioning. It doesn't detract from the exercise benefits though.

Devs: Well done! This is an excellent app. Love the fact you can have multiple profiles, (so my whole family can use it), but is there a way to make the active profile the one that competes online."

Sure the graphics of the update is nice but the hand tracking is really not any good, you cannot hit with punches, need to angle the hand strangely (more like you are cutting the targets), after a few classes you get really strained in the hands from unnatural punches to build combos.

The update made the game great and in order to get the new quest I have to save up the money by using weight loss to pay for it. I want to loose about 40 pounds and I think I can do it with this game. The update they did on the game gave it a cleaner look and made me want to play it more. I started off slow and I am so glad they have shorter sessions that let you adapt to making  the punch connections. I would like to see different backgrounds you can use and also be able to play music that I want to hear. I would even pay for songs that I liked. I will however try using my own music on my headphones this weekend. I do that a lot with beat saber and it works just fine.  I also like the fact that I can turn off the squat bar and only do the punches. Great  game and I am finding it drawing me in and wanting to challenge myself. I worked out for over 30 min today and I have not done that in a long time. I had the golds Gym boxing game for Xbox and this reminds me a lot of that except this is so much better.  I hope they keep this game around for a long time and that they give it more awesome updates .

I liked the feel waaaaaay better than FitXR. I am so annoyed with this game right now!!! I literally had to stop playing mid workout and write this review. You have to basically flick your wrist at the end of the punch or you lose your streak because the game won't recognize your punch. I don't punch that way, I'm not sure anyone does, so it's super annoying to have to constantly think about that as you're punching so you don't lose the streak. I hate that.... A LOT. You can hear that you've made contact, but no flick, no streak. Infuriating!!!! I miss the different locations. I miss the original streak counting. I miss the option to create your own workout. Matter of fact, I was in the middle of creating my ""create your own workout"" when the game crashed and suggested I update, so I did.  When it finally finished updating, BoxVr was gone and so was my workout I just spent 10 minutes trying to create!! Then, lo and behold, the option was no longer available either! Grrr. I tried it out and noticed that I had to punch different to make it count. I gave it several chances and I'm so very disappointed each time. I took a couple weeks off hoping there would be another update in the meantime, but no. I tried again today and it makes me so mad, I wish I never bought BoxVr turned FitXr in the first place!!!!!!!!

Also, this game no longer works offline like BoxVR did. This is huge. With BoxVR, you could turn off your wifi and the game would work perfectly fine. Which makes sense since a person might take their Quest to a place that has poor or no internet connectivity. FitXR stopped my game mid session to complain that it couldn't reach the internet. Are you kidding me?!? 

I paid for BoxVR not this new FitXR. The change was made without warning or my consent. If they had included a legacy mode that allowed you to still play boxVR I would not have a problem. 

Plus, they made all of these changes and still didn't add the one change that everyone wanted: The ability to use custom songs with your workouts instead of the terrible music that comes with the game. 

Changing a game in this way that people have paid for should not be allowed. The only way the developers will get the message is if enough people complain.

Firstly, the streaks seem to operate a bit different, requiring more strength and seeming to encourage you overstressing or overflex your arm joints just to keep your streak.

Secondly, the group mode always seems to malfunction after a short while. All the other people in the 'shared room' together just go limp for the rest of the workout. That seems like a bug, but who knows.

Thirdly, and most concerningly, there is a 1/2 second lag between throwing a punch and hitting the target, particularly when in a group setting, but I've noticed it for individual rounds. It's really impossible to get tricky rhythms correct with this lag. BoxVR didn't have this issue, but whatever changed underneath makes the game really unpleasant to play. You really lose the virtual reality illusion with this issue. Not sure what's going wrong here, but it was working and now (with the new update) it's not any more..."

The developers response to P981 shows that the changes have been made for nothing more than to obtain data for marketing reasons.
'We've asked for you to provide your birthday and gender so we're able to give you the best statistics to make the most out of your workout'  - I used BoxVR for 10-15 minute workouts and had no interest in the statistics and so there is no reason to force me to provide details.
'We've also asked for your email address as this will be your FitXR account ID, which means you can use this to access your account across multiple devices and apps. We‚Äôd never sell this information to any other companies and would only contact you for exciting new product updates, personalised workouts and information about your stats' - BoxVR was only used on the Quest and no other device and the option for multiple devices is of no importance to me so an account is irrelevant.
If as the developers say that the information isn't for any third parties or marketing reasons then they should have offered an option to skip the profile for those of us not interested in using an account just for a short workout.

2657,Bartleby Figgins,"Aug 6, 2020 at 7:30 AM",1,"Man, this update is... not good","I love BoxVR.  LOVE it.  When I saw that it had become FitXR I fired it up, saw the graphics overhaul and thought, hmm, OK, I can dig it... and then I started playing.  

The hit streaks are gone as they were.  Now streaks are based on punch intensity, and you have to punch HARD to streak.  It's an invitation to a shoulder injury on an intense workout.  The old streak system was much much better.  It was simple, easy to understand, penalized misses and rewarded consistent contact.  It was perfect incentivized cardio.  This is just a stupid hot mess.  Give us more points for harder punches, sure.  Don't make it the whole basis for a streak system.

The information presented to the player is arranged extremely poorly.  Why do I need a massive scoreboard?  I need remaining time, I need how many hits I've connected with, I need calories burnt.  This is a workout app.  This information has all been minimized and is difficult to see, in sacrifice to a massive score counter that I couldn't care less about.

The rings from the explosive punches get in the way of visibility of the next hit markers, it makes it harder during an intense workout.

The calorie counting is completely off... and I can't even enter my weight in my profile!  How in the heck am I burning 450 calories in a 21 minute workout?  And how could you know that if you no longer even prompt me to enter my weight?

Ugh, this just sucks.  Did you solicit feedback from the community at all before developing this?  Your steam forum for BoxVR is locked from community comment, it's just a handful of sticky posts from the dev team.  You've got a guy who just started posting on reddit 6 days ago in response to critical comments.  I don't know how the hell you all greenlit this.  It is SO SO MUCH WORSE than the app it replaced.  BoxVR had room for improvement, sure, but you didn't improve it.

Pros:
Better graphics
Can filter and search for songs within the app by time, intensity, genre

Cons:
Literally everything else"

It wasn't bad, it did what it promised but I find the new version, FitXR, much more exciting and motivating to play. I cannot believe how tired and sweaty I get playing even just an 8-11 minute round. I really enjoy going thru the round knowing others are doing it with me. I Love it!

Would give 5 stars if I could play songs from Spotify or my computer.

Edit: Also, as I'm sure it's on the roadmap, but if not please add different environment options."

This FitXR seems to be aimed at 13 and under, with the flying mushrooms you hit and watch them explode.  Let's not forget the useless motivational speech from the trainers.  If you didn't experience BoxVR and went straight into FitXR you may enjoy it because you have no idea what your missing.  BoxVR (workout) asked for Weight/Height and gave you options for glove adjustment as well as music/environment options for your workout.  FitXR is just a  Beta game, with flash and explosions that adds as a distraction instead of a workout.  

To FitXR: If you wish to improve your game to make it a workout experience.  Change the name to BoxVR, offer music, environment, and personalized settings for gloves.  If you can't do that then at least offer a REFUND.
Thank You"

It is the removal of a game a lot of people including myself paid for and then taken away from us and replaced with something else. I would very much like a refund on the ¬£24.99 that I paid for Box VR as I have had it taken away and replaced by something I wouldn't dream of paying that much for!

Surely this is wrong to sell your customers a specific  product then overnight change that product so dramatically its not the same software they paid good money for?

I would like my money back or at the very least a credit for the amount I paid for the Software that has now been removed and replaced with an inferior experience."

2665,Jules,"Aug 6, 2020 at 3:44 AM",1,üëéüèª,"BoxVR had three environments. Of the three, one was futuristic. I really disliked that environment and always preferred boxing in one of the gym environments. I suspect many BoxVR players preferred the gym environments too. And now, with FitXR, I am forced to exercise in a dark futuristic setting (feels like laser bowling). I am a 40+ yr old woman and well past the age where I find laser bowling appealing. I did not purchase BoxVR to be a game, I purchased it to exercise in a clean, simple environment. 

I want the pure exercise experience I paid for. The developers should have sold this laser boxing experience separately to those interested in playing a game."
2666,Ajsim,"Aug 22, 2020 at 10:37 AM",2,Considerable downgrade,"The supposed upgrade that FitXR should have been to the game that I purchased (BoxVR) is actually a considerable downgrade. There is less functionality now, fewer rooms, you have to make an account and the tracking is (still) inconsistent. It wouldn't surprise me if the developers will try to make us pay extra to get previous functionality back after a while. Very disappointing.

Update: I have played the ""updated"" version of this game quite a few times now and I'm still thoroughly disappointed. When I play against the other avatars, the tracking appears more laggy and I can't look at the avatars anyway, because I'll miss my own punches. Basically, the only motivational aspect could be the leaderboard that you can view throughout your workout, but I highly doubt whether this leaderboard reflects reality. Since you're now supposed to hit the blocks at a certain speed to keep your streak going, it has become almost physically impossible to do so when the blocks come at you in a very rapid succession. I'm in good health and quite fit, but there simply isn't any time to make those arm movements in a natural way. Nevertheless there will often be an avatar with a 50+ streak (early on) while I'm stuck at 10. I like the idea of some competition being involved, but this feels fake to me."
2667,George,"Sep 22, 2020 at 8:14 AM",4,New Update,Lets me start of by saying that the new update is fuegooooooo!! Being able to box with other online users really brings out the competitor in me it's like being in an actual class. Pushing yourself when you want to quit just a bit more just like everyone else I love it. Definitely try it out! Cancel the gym and just play the vr and get in shape my quads and for arms are dying right now but I loved it
2668,cornytoad,"Jul 31, 2020 at 9:28 PM",3,Now missing some of what I loved most,"So it seemed out of nowhere BoxVR became FitVR. It‚Äôs a visual upgrade that includes new music and features, but it‚Äôs a mixed bag of what it added and what it took away. 

They‚Äôve added group classes (which you can turn off). You can now turn off squats if you need to for say a hurting knee or sheer exhaustion. And the whole program seems updated to be flashier and more modern. 

Now a plus, but more of a minus. They‚Äôve now placed an emphasis on scored points and the strength of your hits. In fact your power hits are scaled based on speed/force and the dashboard shows you a streak as you go. Your point multiplier is based upon a power hit streak and no longer based on how many hits you make period. I never cared about my total score. I cared about my end percentage of hits. I wanted to challenge myself by making sure I hit all the hooks, the blocks, the ducks, etc..  FitVR doesn‚Äôt show that information at all anymore. Just your total points score. For some this is great, for some they won‚Äôt care. With so much  data being tracked, why can‚Äôt we have both? 

To be honest,  FitVR‚Äôs total emphasis on power hits becomes a de-motivator. You can‚Äôt keep hitting at the speed it wants if you‚Äôre doing this for longer workouts, or if, like me, you‚Äôre doing this at the end of a weight workout. You‚Äôre tired. No matter how fit you are. So you play and just watch your streak and high streak go nowhere. Even if you‚Äôve hit hundreds of hits in a row. That‚Äôs no fun when it used to be fun to see I hit 1790 hits in a row in BoxVR at the end. 

As for the group classes, right now it feels like it‚Äôs a pseudo-class. There‚Äôs no way oculus has so many players online to fill the class with you. What it seems like is that FitVR creates random players to box with you in the room to motivate you in the beginning. Why just the beginning? Because you‚Äôll notice halfway through their scores stop going up and you rise to the top of the class. There‚Äôs no way in every session I‚Äôve done that EVERYONE drops out. 

Back to the main menu and stats. It appears you can no longer see which classes you‚Äôve already done at a quick glance (because the percent you got in BoxVR is gone now). Nor are the categorized by how long they are. It‚Äôs just random. You can have a 9 minute class listed then a 59 minute class next to a 22 minute class. Why? This is such a simple fix since the menu was so clear on BoxVR. Also, without entering your weight, how accurate can the calorie burn count be? 

I still enjoy the boxing part of the game, but for the first time I‚Äôm interested in seeing what else is out there. The biggest reasons being that I don‚Äôt care about total points. I don‚Äôt like being de-motivated by my lack of power hits as I get exhausted. And I miss seeing how my percentages add up at the end of a session. Seeing that 100% next to a class is rewarding. It drives you go want to complete all of them and go back if you didn‚Äôt get 100%. That was more motivating me me. 

I‚Äôm still playing, just bummed."
2669,Temperance,"Sep 9, 2020 at 4:39 PM",5,I started playing xrfit again,"I shelved boxvr for months before seeing the new update and just wow.  I love what boxvr has become after this update.  I love the new effects and animations.  The punch gage is an awesome touch, seeing how hard I'm hitting really makes me want to throw more into my punches.  I love multi-player as well and it's great to be able to see how I compare to others.  The songs are much better and flow so perfectly with the punches.  I don't know why all these people are complaining about not being able to see calories when it shows them right after each level. 

Overall I think the devs did an amazing job with this update and if happily pay more just to buy xrfit at this point but thankfully the devs gave it to us as a free update.  Don't listen to the negative reviews from ppl who can't adapt to change. This game is now far superior than boxvr ever was and I'm sure it will only get better with time.  Awesome job devs."
2670,ScowlinMunkeh,"Sep 10, 2020 at 12:26 AM",5,UPDATED REVIEW,"EDITED REVIEW

I‚Äôve upgraded this from three to five stars for a number of reasons:

First of all, superb developer response. It‚Äôs great to have your feedback acknowledged, and even better to see the improvements you and your fellow gamers have highlighted turn up in the game!

The bugs appear to be fixed when you join a class - your classmates stay with you until the end of the class. 

You can add your weight. I‚Äôm still unsure how effective this is at plotting calorie burn, but it has been added!

Lots of great option re choosing the class that works for you.

It‚Äôll definitely get you fit if you do 30-60 minutes if this a day! I recommend you get a sweatband or some kind of headscarf so you do not cover your headset in sweat!! 

EDITED REVIEW ENDS


PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW

Let‚Äôs get the bug report out of the way first.

I join classes but the other class members freeze before halfway through. I have not had one working class yet.

I‚Äôve had the game glitch where the screen became covered in scattered blue blocks of colour, obscuring the incoming hit pads.


Ok, appraisal of the game itself:

Pros 
- a variety of classes, instructors, and music.
- a good daily, weekly, monthly stats counter 
- nice graphics
- nice sounds, such as encouraging words from instructors 
- will probably get you fit if you stick at it

Cons
- no variation in scenery. The old version had three different kwoons. This has one.
- scored by power over precision. It is impossible to get a 100% streak on this version, as you‚Äôre too wiped out to do the power shots required before the end of each session. 
- In the previous version I really enjoyed aiming for 100% hooks, jabs, dodges etc, but that has gone. Why? 
- The calorie counter cannot possibly be accurate, as the game does not record your height or weight - only your gender and age. I suggest it overestimates calories burned by around 30%.

Summary:
I can see the overall attempt to revitalise the game, and I applaud the effort. However, in its current buggy state with some of the more fun features removed, and a calorie counter you can‚Äôt depend upon, I‚Äôm hard pressed to recommend it."
2671,a,"Aug 18, 2020 at 10:20 PM",1,Great disappointment.,"You deleted the game I bought and replaced it with a sub par game with nowhere near the same level of customisation. I had carefully crafted workouts tailored for ME where I collected the songs I MYSELF wanted in MY preferred order of workout intensity, and I was very happy with it. I wouldn't mind starting from scratch if I could but nope not possible.

Bright open environments that help me wake up during my morning exercise? Also gone.

Hand tracking? Somehow worse apparently.

Suddenly having a enormous menu stretching almost 180 degrees? Stupid and unnecessary.

Pirates? Mockingly reminding me that this sort of thing wouldn't happen to me if I downloaded games illegally. Should I feel stupid for actually paying for things? Maybe.

Please fix this. It shouldn't be too much work if the features have been there and working until this point and the deleted."
2672,RDuthart,"Aug 31, 2020 at 12:45 PM",5,BoxVr upgraded,"I‚Äôve seen so many complaints about the update in the review section. And until I had the chance to try it my thoughts were that the developer had stolen my fitness partner and replaced it with some evil. 

Gladly this is not the case, some people just don‚Äôt like change.

Firstly and most importantly, gone are the awkward boxing gloves that never seemed to be positioned as if they would be on my hands. Along with this is the benefit of actually striking orbs when you feel you should be (naturally).

Regarding the complaints I‚Äôve seen regarding the choice of environments, in BoxVr your talking about two different floors and a very poor looking digital environment. Hardly groundbreaking stuff.

Now you have a workout area that feels like you are in the same building as the locker room. Yet you have fantastic head On visibility of your streak, and score. No longer do you need to look left to see if you lost your streak.

You look down to see your power and velocity, on the right of you is your leaderboard position.

The lighting in the virtual environment is superb, with the shadows and effects when striking Orbs (which in contrast with another reviewer cause absolutely no distraction to your next hit.)


This is a superb refinement of a fantastic fitness tool. I‚Äôm sure many people who have complained have since come tk appreciate the improvements. 

I was in the fortunate position to have two quests available with which to compare the old and new. Do the update, or if your thinking of buying don‚Äôt let the negative reviews put you off this is a great workout tool."
2673,KP,"Sep 22, 2020 at 1:23 AM",4,Pretty good,"I like the new updated version, makes it a better workout. What I hate is the refresh rate, it can‚Äôt keep up with the speed of punching. The left glove flies off, and the left glove has contact problems when doing cross punches. You swing and the ball goes right on by.  The right glove works perfect, never have any problems with. I all ready ordered the new unit that‚Äôs coming out, hopefully the refresh rate will be better."
2674,Spark,"Oct 6, 2020 at 5:49 PM",4,Love this app,I love this app!!!

2675,Bluerigel,"Aug 7, 2020 at 8:42 AM",1,Extremely Dissapointed. Do NOT purchase!,"This is not the same game I purchased. Like many others, I am vastly disappointed in this ‚Äúupdate‚Äù, which is not an update at all. It‚Äôs a completely different app and a HUGE step back. There were many features taken out compared to BoxVR. The multiplayer isn‚Äôt real (just ghost data), no ability to create your own playlists, workout with friends, the game is glitchy, lack of different environments, and the list goes on...

I am extremely puzzled and don‚Äôt understand how the decision was made to replace the old version COMPLETELY instead of having 2 separate apps by the same developer? I used to recommend BoxVR to everyone I knew. Safe to say that will not be happening anymore. 

If you‚Äôre thinking about purchasing this app, save your money and take it elsewhere."
2676,Vigne,"Nov 15, 2020 at 6:50 PM",3,Bugs on latest version,Hand tracking is a little bit buggy on the latest version. The hand can move on it's own and it can break series.
2677,Jonathan Zulkeski,"Aug 4, 2020 at 9:43 PM",1,FitXR is not BoxVR,"UPDATE: Dev claims they removed playlists for ""fitness standards"". Do not pretend to know me. It's insulting. 

You took my favorite game and ruined it. After playing for 2 days, here's my issues with the game:

- The presentation of hit directional indicators is less intuitive and they are too short.
- The Block indicator regularly obscures the view from what is coming next, causing a miss. 
- You took what was a great tool for challenging myself and made it so that it's based around challenging others, which is the opposite of what I want. I want to workout, not be competitive. 
- Score streaks are impossible and hits don't count correctly anymore. 
- There is too much going on. There are too many things to look at while you're training. 
- I dont' want to be in some futuristic stadium. I want to be in a gym atmosphere like how BoxVR was. 
- I WANT MY CUSTOM PLAYLISTS RETURNED. I don't care what FitXR's fitness agenda is. 
- Everything doesn't need to try and be Peleton. It's overdone. 
- Put a lobby in the front of the entire game that allows you to select BoxVR or FitXR (or maybe ""Original"" and ""Ruined"" mode) and stop trying to fix what isn't broken. If you can't put a lobby in place, make a separate app and GIVE ME BACK BoxVR.
- Controller tracking now regularly makes my hands ""float away"" (I have hand tracking turned off)

----original review----
You should have given BoxVR users a second app. This new one with no custom playlists, wiping all my previous completions, requiring online to play and asking me for all my personal information is trash. On top of it, the streaks do not calculate properly. It's showing me miss even though the ""notes"" (or whatever you call them) explode.  My left hand now regularly floats away causing missed notes.  As the ""game"" stands right now, I cannot recommend it, and will be looking for a way to sideload BoxVR.... you know... what I paid for and a better game."

that the upgrade made things worse.
A good game turned bad.
It was the only game I played often on my quest. 

While 1 star is too low for this game, it's not that bad of a game, it is compared to the old version BoxVr.

I am sure it will get better but that will take months.

Not going to repeat the other reviews by stating the bad (and some small improvements). 


Dissapointed, it feels like they turned a quant little village into a Disneyland theme park.


Edit Day 2:
I wanted to give it another go (and chance). Gave up bored and annoyed after 5 minutes.
This game is in it's current state is a 1 or at most 2 star. 
Even new buyers beware.

The mechanics are no longer fun, the black is super depressing.

Feeling more and more disgruntled, why did you change this. Yes I work in IT and I understand rebuilding something from the ground up will offer for more features to be added by getting rid of technical debt. But your players liked it the way it was..."

They took away the playlists that I painstakingly built. What the hell? I was able to craft my own workouts that fit my style better. 

How do I get a refund now that you‚Äôve ruined this app?

Also, just for the record. I can't even get FitVR to get beyond the new setup. First, it forces me to create an account, something I'm not interested in, and then it hangs at the set difficulty level. I lost 20 minutes, the normal time of my BoxVR workout, trying to get it to work.

Obviously this app wasn't ready, but more importantly, this was not the app that I purchased. I believe it is fair to say, you have broken your end of the contract at this point. If this would have been the original app I purchased I would have returned it in the allotted time.

Today is 08-06-2020. I am respectfully asking for my money back. Obviously, you can restore the app I gave you money for as well. If you do either of these things, I will remove this review. It is your business to go a completely new, if not wanted, direction, but you have to keep to the terms of your original agreement.

The Onward team did the right thing and restored the game their users paid for. This happened just this week. I am not interested in waiting a month or more for playlist capability and then rebuilding mine all over again.

You can probably tell I'm a little miffed. I used this game four days a week for at least 20 minutes. I'm in a weight loss competition and wasn't expecting to have to replace my main cardio app, but I will soon. This was an important tool of mine. I will be moving on and hopefully to a developer that doesn't try such a thing with their users.

Please give me my money back. It's the right thing to do.

2680,lord_lucifer,"Sep 8, 2020 at 10:53 AM",4,Great game! I recommend it!,"So i decided to update my review after playing it for awhile. It's still a fun game for sure. And you can definitely tell the team works hard on collecting user feedback and implementing it to help improve the game. But here's the thing. 

Fake multiplayer mode is worse than no multiplayer mode. 

Some of the levels last wayy too long. This is supposed to be a game made for fitness and not fitness made into a game, like how it feels now. I would like to choose a song and play it through and then go to a different song. Instead of stuck for a 45 minute session. Anything over 5 minutes is too long. Theres a reason beat saber doesn't have long songs. While we want to keep playing we also want to choose what we play. 

Also, too many squats. This now feels like an 80's hiit class rather than boxing class. There is no slides. Not even the session called punch and slide have slides. Squats should be used sparingly, and not 10 in a roll. I'm here to play while get some cardio done. And now im repulsed by the idea of starting a game bc its forced cardio. 

Also, i could not miss a beat and get stuck to 5-7 streaks. Even when i hit the streak would break. You can't calculate power so don't. You can't even calculate speed. It's just how wide a swing is. Which makes absolutely no sense for boxing game bc that just open the boxer up to get punched. 

Theres also the feature of changing background removed. 

Overall, it's still a fun game, but now it doesn't feel as much like a game as it does to a bad fitness class. Look forward to see future improvements."
2681,Fire,"Aug 5, 2020 at 6:11 PM",1,Seriously?!?!... WTF,"I'm very upset that without any warning at all, yal just totally took away BoxVR and replaced it with something completely, FitXr. You need to return our $ for BoxVR bc this was not an update. Now with this new bad version, I can't play with friends in real time.  When I got on the new version, I actually liked the designed and I thought I was playing in real time with others in the class. I was so STOKED with that update. But on the 3rd day playing, I realized that the class is FAKE. The leader board scoring is FAKE. I went on with my sister and we tried to join the class together is what confirmed the fraud. I was wondering why the classes seem to always be full when on BoxVR you would rarely see much activity in the multiplayer classes. At least that is what has been my experience playing after work hours in the evening. So after realizing I no longer can play with friends and family, and the leader board scoring is fake... I lost interest and motivation because it's NOT COMPETETIVE. It could at least have a leader board among social media friends like Beat Saber. Now lets talk about the Streak Score. HATE IT, but could love it if you would also include the normal Streak Score as well. You have to punch really hard and super fast at the same time to keep up the streak. Yes it does make you work harder but you shouldn't lose credit because you didn't hit it hard even though you actually did hit it.  It's fustrating! In BoxVR you got streak credit for every punch you hit. I mean isn't that what a streak means?
Now the classes, Not much there. And not much of a variation. There's no Hip Hop music for classes with Intensity level. I have a problem with that. I'm a professional Boxer, and Hip Hop music is the main music in the boxing community.  I brought an extreme pack in BoxVR, it still says purchased, but it does not work? Why???"
2682,Raj,"Aug 5, 2020 at 9:19 AM",1,Absolute BS. BAIT & SWITCH!,"Honestly, I am pretty livid right now and I would give this app 0 stars if I could. I had read the reviews about the ‚Äúupdate‚Äù being a completely new app overhaul that was nothing like the original application bought and I was pretty sad about it. I made sure not to update the app so that I could keep the old BoxVR that I love and somehow, the app has automatically updated to the new FitVR! I am so freaking unhappy, sad, and frankly, pissed about this!!

I have been excited to show my family this app for months because I knew they would absolutely love it and was waiting until the COVID situation died down to show them but this complete overhaul and bait and switch of an app is not it! I am not excited to show them this at all!!

I used to be able to do multiple sessions for up to an hour in BoxVR and I played an 8 min session in the new FitVR and have a legitimate headache now! Halfway through it, my eyes were already starting to hurt because of the dark background and ridiculously bright contrasting colors on everything else in there. 
I don‚Äôt care for the new futuristic-esque environment that they were going for, and I am a millennial. I loved the gym look and feeling when going to the home page in BoxVR and being able to select gym-like environments because it felt more authentic. I felt like I was actually getting some good and realistic boxing practice in. If I wanted the futuristic one, I could choose that too. But this new environment in FitVR is BS and a literal pain and headache to experience. 

The new targets look sad compared to the past version (they must have spent all their time on the graphics everywhere else) and the extra firework-like effects every time you hit a target is distracting for me and makes the light headache even worse. 

I could care less about the supposed ‚Äúgroup sessions‚Äù and they‚Äôre just floating heads and hands you have to make a real effort to see and I didn‚Äôt find it motivating in the slightest. But maybe that‚Äôs just me.  

The gloves are gone and it‚Äôs just another take away from the boxing aspect. I want to feel like I‚Äôm BOXING, not just swinging my glowing hands at some sad, floating mushrooms -_-

The FitPoints or whatever they are called are arbitrary and not helpful to me at all. How are they even calculated?? What happened to my hit and miss stats on each punch/block variation?!!? That was so much more helpful and motivating than this stupid point system and however the hell the system counts your ‚Äústreaks‚Äù! The ‚Äústreaks‚Äù are ridiculously demotivating because it is hard to maintain and not really helpful in terms of accuracy, consistency, or technique. I didn‚Äôt even want to finish the 8 minute session 4 minutes in because I was already frustrated. 

There are wayyyyy less sessions than there used to be. Like legitimately half or even less than what there used to be and the music and motivation aspect of them just aren‚Äôt the same. And what happened to my customized playlists?!? They‚Äôre all gone! I had a steady routine I had made and with the loss of my playlists, that is all gone!!

This ‚Äúupdate‚Äù = complete overhaul is absolute bulls**t. I am so incredibly disappointed and sad honestly, that my favorite workout app for VR has been ruined and the excitement that I used to have to play and get a good workout in is completely gone. Even looking at the app on my home screen makes me upset now. 

And what is worse is that I tried to avoid it and yet the update forced itself through and I lost all my playlists and all my faith in this app and developer. 
I honestly want a refund. This is NOT the app I bought! It is 100% different in all aspects and is a complete bait and switch! This ‚Äúupdate‚Äù should have been a completely separate application!!

DEVELOPERS!!! You either need to make this right and offer refunds or add in a retro version of the old app for those of us who paid for BoxVR NOT FitVR!! 

And if that does not happen, I will request a full refund because this is not the app I paid for and this was not your team ‚Äúlistening‚Äù to what your customers wanted. It is so far beyond that and honestly, disrespectful to your consumer base. A beta test version might have saved you some trouble. 

You all had such a high rating on this app and I hope you see how this ‚Äúupdate‚Äù has been received by the majority of your consumers and MAKE IT RIGHT!

2683,Bruno,10/9/2002 0:00,2,"The framerate, even on quest 2 is awful",The framerate on BoxVR was good but on FitXR the game seems to be capped at something below 60fps which makes the game really uncomfortable to play.
2684,Blackthorne,"Aug 4, 2020 at 5:24 PM",1,Why though?,"I paid $30 for a game called box VR and another $30 for DLC for a game called box VR.

I was happy with box VR. It was a good game and I played it every day.

A recent update took box VR away and replaced it with something called fit XR.

Fit XR is not a very good game. It certainly isn't worth $30. It offers less content less options for gameplay, less songs, less customizability and plays poorly when compared with box VR.

I was trying very hard to figure out why a Dev would do this. They took all the content that I paid for away and replaced it with something far less.

The only time I have ever seen developers do something this slimy is when they are preparing to move to a subscription model so that they can take all of the content that you paid for away and resell it to you or rent it to you.

If this was really an update to the game then it would have at least a similar amount of content to what they took away. That's why I think they're doing something shady.

I recommended box VR very highly it was a five-star game. I do not recommend fit XR at all. It's not worth a dollar in its current state. If you are considering a purchase of this game do yourself a favor and don't.

I consider what the devs have done to be theft and I'm not going to forget it."

The old version I grew out of the original version day 1 and bought the extreme pack and was happy. I loved being able to pick my environment and I loved getting perfect scores based on getting the cues. Now I have to use crap form and wildly swing my arms to get the correct speed to get a streak. This is going to get people hurt and not get them to work out. I want to be able to play the old version again

2687,Tim Emineth,"Aug 7, 2020 at 6:45 PM",1,Your Broke A Great Game,"You broke a great boxing game!!!!! I played box vr just about everyday in which I could get a perfect on almost every workout. Now you care more about speed an accuracy really in what fitness world have you ever belonged to where speed is more important than form. But I can adjust and change to that. YOU KILLED THE ACCURACY! hooks and upper cuts barely work. There is no longer a reward for a higher streak, there is no punishment for missing which is good because I now end up missing 50 or more hooks and uppercuts because you guessed the accuracy sucks. LAG is an issue, why should someone else connection effect my game play I can tell it does sine the ball explodes behind me half of the time. You can no longer adjust where the hit point is on the glove so now I don't know where to punch. So in essence you turned the game into the person who can fail their arms the fastest will get the best workout. punching faster doesn't give you a better workout, it just makes your arms tired."
2688,sampothepancake,"Sep 10, 2020 at 5:40 PM",4,"Good, but there are issues","First, the good: this is a surprisingly good workout. I've been using this for a week now, and I've already seen an increase in stamina. I'm also surprised to find I have a noticeable increase in your body muscle mass! I really didn't expect that from shadow boxing, but the intensity does get high enough to impact arms and shoulders.

On the not-so-good front, any actual boxing experience is going to be a bit of a hindrance. The way movement is measured in-game, you are rewarded for exaggerating and phoning in your hooks and upper cuts. If you've built up any muscle memory for how to throw a real punch, you're going to have to fight it. Additionally, if you don't have any self defense training already and that is a concern to you, I would caution that learning to move like this game teaches could be detrimental to that cause. This should be obvious, but just in case anyone thinks otherwise, you will need separate instruction if you wish to lean to defend yourself."

NOW THEY'RE ALL GONE. I've lost my achievements, my leaderboards, my progress, my gym environment, my game features.

Maybe I would have bought FitXR if it were a separate product. You could even have advertised it within BoxVR, why not. Honestly, I'm just sad that I lost everything, from my hard-earned achievements to my gym environment.

Some of us were used to what we had. We incorporated it into our routine. It's really disappointing that you didn't account for us.

I want my game and my progress back. Sure, have FitXR as well, I might even buy it at some point. But please don't touch my $30 BoxVR.

I trust that you had good intentions doing this, but the truly correct thing to do would have been to keep BoxVR and give existing players a discounted price ($15) for FitXR, and only release it once more features have been added. Because, right now, it has less features, and not more."

2696,Otherbits,"Oct 6, 2020 at 10:23 AM",3,"Ok as a fitness app, not as a game","If you want to treat this as a game, I cannot recommend it at all. Not only is it incredibly bland compared to other rhythm games, the tracking is so bad that chasing high scores is pointless. The track list is also very uninspired, and there's no way to select individual tracks, just premade workouts.
As a fitness app, however, it makes more sense. The premade workouts, grouped by length and intensity, do make you build up a sweat. And the insistence on not just hitting the orbs, but hitting them as hard as possible, makes it more intense than other rhythm games.
Still, even judged as a fitness app, this is the bare minimum that would get a recommendation from me. Especially for the price, there are better and more entertaining ways to get fit. Not many of them can be done during a lockdown, though, which is why I bought FitXR. If anyones stuck inside and wants something to help them stay active, I can recommend this, but not highly. For anyone else, I'd pass on this one."

2. Where is the old streak record? I just want to know how many times In a row I hit the target. I don‚Äôt care about the power streak. 

3. What‚Äôs up with the sparks and ring of fire? The flashes make my eyes very tired after playing for 60 minutes. Can we please have the option to turn them off?

4. Playlist - in the old app I could create my own playlist and select the intensity. Now
I can‚Äôt! There is only 1 ‚ÄúIntense‚Äù that only last for 20 minutes!

Would love to see more environments to workout in and and more consistency with combos, several times I am hitting my punches and it‚Äôs acknowledging that I landed the punch but combo goes back to zero. Overall my favorite workout game by a mile."
2701,Hot Dog Water,"Sep 5, 2020 at 2:13 AM",5,Love the FitXR update/rebranding,"If you are potentially interested in this game, check the date of people‚Äôs review because a major update happened summer 2020 that resolved a bunch of issues. 

The prior version was OK but a bit of a chore and missing some finish. As a fitness app I figured good enough. I was pleasantly surprised by the update to fitXR. Workouts look better, feel better and are more motivating. 

To my last point, when you do a workout, you (optionally) compete against the ghosts of previous players which is surprisingly motivating due to a live scoreboard. I keep finding myself looking at the list of people and how many points I need to pass the next person. It keeps me engaged and I always feel the right amount of competition. 

The new visuals and presentation are more modern and feel like a new game. It‚Äôs evident a lot of care went into the interface. The old one was ok so again pleasantly surprised by the new (free) upgrade.  

Gameplay is similar but seems smoother. I don‚Äôt know that the music has changed but I feel like it has for the better and I also feel the punches are more aligned with the rhythm. 

If I had a couple of criticisms I would say the voiceover work of the trainers gets really repetitive. Some songs don‚Äôt have voiceover which is sometimes preferred. Less frequent and more precise comments would be best. My only other criticism is that it seems like it takes too much force to blow up a target. This is really just an annoyance during a quick sequence when you lose a streak. For one off targets, it makes you work harder ( which is the point!)

I don‚Äôt feel these criticisms offset the good here and really just represent improvement opportunities to an awesome game. 5 stars."
2702,FriesSupersize,"Aug 9, 2020 at 11:36 PM",1,Won't work without internet connection,"EDIT: Review update. After realizing that this app can't be started without an active WiFi connection, I'm dropping to 1 star. There is no reason I shouldn't be able to play this offline. Especially when I've purchased one of the expansion packs, don't hold my purchase hostage. I should be able to use it whenever I want. 


Previously a heavy user of BoxVR on Rift. The update to FItVR is appreciated in a lot of ways, but it still needs a few tweaks to get to 5 stars. 1) I purchased one of the expansion packs, and it is extremely confusing once the purchase is made. There is zero visual indication of how you‚Äôre supposed to access the additional workouts, or which workouts are included in the pack. 2) The streaks now rely on punching with a certain amount of ‚Äúpower‚Äù,  but the threshold to achieve a power-punch is inconsistent and too high. It works even less reliably on uppercuts and hooks. To have any hope at keeping a streak going, you have to punch so hard that it feels like you might injure yourself 3) The timing on uppercuts and hooks (especially uppercuts) is off somehow. Hard to explain, but often an uppercut seems to ‚Äúexplode‚Äù with a delay after it‚Äôs already passed slightly out of view instead of in front of you."

2705,Nel,"Sep 7, 2020 at 9:19 PM",4,Am I doing something wrong??,"UPDATE: The tracking for Quest in this game is much improved, thank you so much devs! However, I must mention that sometimes when I hit targets, my hand goes straight through and doesn't register as a hit. This bug can be incredibly frustrating when you're doing an ""intense"" rated workout, and you're jamming to the track, and you're keeping up through the song pretty well, and you wanna be competitive and get the highest score, but then you miss a bunch of hits because of a bug in the game and you look up to see you're ranked like 4th or 5th against other players because you were robbed of those hits. It makes me feel like I'm failing even though it's not even my fault and it throws everything off. Also, the blocks are never on beat with the music and it's disorienting. But, a huge level of improvement, overall! Hopefully, you guys will see this and can fix these other issues. Also, I'd love to know who some of the artists are in the game, but the game doesn't tell me who they are while in a workout. Is there a way to find them out? I might have overlooked it if there is.


I really like this game, but why does it feel like the Quest's cameras are not tracking my hooks and uppercuts? I'm doing the motions as it shows, on time, but it's not reading me. Am I swinging too hard or too far? I can't really tell. Would be helpful if the game provided helpful tips on what the hooks and uppercuts should look like, in case I'm not doing them right. Hope the devs or Oculus reach out to me about this, I really want to fully enjoy this experience. Maybe that's just how the Quest version is."
2706,poppywinkles,"Aug 5, 2020 at 10:51 AM",1,FitXR the new coke of VR,"I purchase BoxVR about 2 months ago, and I have played it almost every day. I actually looked forward to doing exercise for the first time in my life. After an hour of BoxVR I would be tired, but would keep playing, just for fun. Surprise, I open my oculus, and BoxVR is gone, replaced with something new... FitXR, or the VR version of New Coke, for those of you old enough to remember that debacle.

FitXR has taken the joy out of my workouts, now I am watching the clock, just waiting for this garbage show to finish. I will keep using it, because it is a good work out, but I would really appreciate some sort of access to the game that I actually purchased. This game has too much visual stimulation, with clocks, power bars, levels, explosions, scoreboards, lined pathway where the ugly mushroom shaped things fly at you... Its overkill and completely ruins the minimalist asthetic that I think so many of the people loved about BoxVR.

Please offer the original version to those who have paid for it. This is a bait and switch and I hate this new version. Sometimes less is more."

- Really REALLY bad ""Streaks"" concept, you can get hurt if you try. You need to hit so fast that probably it's a bad idea you try.
- A lot of good routines were removed.
I'm feeling a little bit like someone scam me: I bought something, they delivered something else, completely different."
2708,Nique,"Aug 23, 2020 at 6:38 PM",2,I tried but I‚Äôm over it,"I wanted to get active while being quarantined so I decided to try BOXVR (before the change). I loved it. I could play for 2 hours every day and started feeling better and even started losing weight. BOXVR became a regular part of my workout routine. I played every single day for 1 month straight. I never had any issues with the game besides sore muscles that eventually got better the more I worked out. 

And then...the ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù. 

I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the one environment available or the FX with the hits but I wasn‚Äôt going to write it off because it was a part of my daily workouts. So I played for about 2 days (reluctantly) and I found it hard to stay motivated and had to MAKE myself play it so I could get my workout in for the day. After a week, I definitely understood why the changes were needed as far as the hit streaks. I was a lot more tired after an hour work out so I wasn‚Äôt completely against it the upgrade. 

It‚Äôs been about a month and I‚Äôve given up. I may use it about once a week or do an 8 minute song and then quit. 


The problem isn‚Äôt just the technical stuff, the streaks, the ONE environment, glitches, etc. but it‚Äôs also the physical pain from working out. It requires a lot of force to maintain a streak record but the amount of force needed minus ZERO resistance has thrown my shoulder off. It HURTS to play...and I don‚Äôt mean from muscle fatigue (I had been playing daily for months and the muscle fatigue/soreness was gone after a few weeks when I first started). Through out the day, I‚Äôm stretching and rotating my shoulder to get some relief. I‚Äôve tried a few adjustments to my overall form when playing but it‚Äôs just not worth it anymore. 

I‚Äôm not a boxer. I don‚Äôt want to be a boxer. I just want to work out in a way that‚Äôs fun and effective and safe. FITXR is no longer that for me."

There is no option to create your own workouts with the new update which also sucks because you are stuck with only the classes to chose from.

On the original game I could easily have a hit streak of 300+ but after playing this on and off for 3 days the longest streak I had was 10!  To get qualified as a hit it looks like not only do you have to hit it in the glowing part of the orb but also hit with enough speed to to create the glowing ring......which is another issue.  On the more intensive levels the glowing ring spreads out and visually blocks the next couple orbs, which in these faster levels causes you to mistime your punches.

2713,J.J.,"Aug 6, 2020 at 11:47 PM",1,Epic Fail!,"I do not remember that anything concerning an application has ever made me this angry.
It took several days for me now to be able to write something about it because I was so upset and I really still cannot believe what they did.
 
As many users stated before:
THIS WAS NOT AN UPDATE!
FIT XR IS A COMPLETE DIFFERENT SOMETHING AND IT IS NOT WHAT I PURCHASED!
I PURCHASED BOX VR!
 
The application I purchased has been deleted and has been replaced by a different one which is obviously just in beta status.
Even their developers do not dare to call it a real stable release version as it is still just ""0.9"".
 
There have already been many statements of what is wrong with FIT XR and I agree to all of them.

One thing is missing for me which I would like to add:

For me BOX VR was about boxing in sync with the rhythm of the music. You could get in some kind of ""flow"" with the music.

FIT XR is about punching targets as hard as you can with some background music that I do not like.

This is something completely different!
 
With BOX VR I sometimes had hard but fun workouts that were 90 or 120 minutes long with my own playlists.
With FIT XR I had 16 minutes at max always checking the clock hoping that this boring arcade punching session would finally end.
 
I would really like to see their CEO's face when someone brings his Porsche (or Ferrari?) to the junkyard and replaces it with a bicycle with flat wheels (but with bright shiny colors).
 
Being a software developer myself it took some time for me to understand why they did this like they did.
The only reason I can imagine is that their investors want a return of investment asap.

In order to achieve this they are surely going to try to sell many additional services and add-ons soon.

Having BOX VR aside of FIT XR would have prevented this as only some would have bought FIT XR and many of them would have refunded it soon due to its lacking functionality. That's why they had to remove BOX VR.

Please remove all the ratings before the release of this so-called ""update"" so that everyone is able to see the real rating of this crap.

Since I can see my hand tracked through the orbs it says I miss, I don‚Äôt know why this happens, but if I had the option to not have to worry about a scoring system, I could just focus on my the routine and find out the score and max chain after it‚Äôs over.

I liked it when it was box vr, (a previous iteration), but love the new art style and fx.  
My only criticisms would be regarding the hand tracking. Often times half way through a workout session it will lose tracking of my hands and mess up my whole rhythm and score.  From a design standpoint- it‚Äôs important to make fist and grip the controllers well- which means my hands would be holding down the trigger and side buttons.  If signal is being sent during this time due to pressed buttons- then that‚Äôs signal that isn‚Äôt being used and may be the cause of latency I‚Äôm experiencing when my hands lose tracking. My suggestion would be to disable those buttons if that‚Äôs the case."

1-The count of the series is frustrating! Never know why sometimes It‚Äôs ok and other time no.
2-No possibilty to place my score in the world palmares as I could do before.
3-I placed my gloves in a certain way on the previous version ( thanks to the adjusting of the gloves) with the sensors head down. It was very convenient for me but for now the positions of the gloves are imposed and I can‚Äôt strike as easily as before on the previous version.
4-The count of the calories are obviously wrong and low estimated ..and how come the app could indicate our calorie expenditure without knowing my weight and height ?
5-The group training is fake and all the others partners stop playing at the same time when I have to change my feet position.
6- No way to understand how hitting the targets to make them explode. The previous version indicated the points hit by hit on the target itself so no need to look up the screen and loose following targets.

So please leave us the possibility to go back at the ( so better) previous version for whom who wanted to.

Edit: Response to ""Developer Response"" 
Your ""ask"" for the information is in fact a requirement. Make it optional and then it's a true ""ask"". 
I'd also like to bring up the fact you're using the BoxVR ratings to capitalize on the ratings for your new app, yet you've removed the playlists and stats from BoxVR. How about you do the same here and wipe out all ratings for BoxVR and rely on FitXR ratings only?"
2727,Dr Mobius,"Aug 1, 2020 at 3:11 PM",1,Terrible overhaul. Not the app I paid fo,"BoxVR was bare bones but I liked that. It was simple, the work outs were great, you were able to concentrate and focus. The tracks were great, really got you moving.
Now comes FitXR...all lights and in your face. You can't focus cause you feel like you're in Vegas, lights exploding right in your face. Giant score board right in front of you, you can barely see the balls coming at you. Music doesn't feel as well paced. Too much like a video game and less like a fitness app.
And absolutely no settings. I care about the workout, not meaningless scores. You can't turn off the scoring, can't turn off the explosions of light. Very distracting. You can't even customise the colours coming at you for better contrast...really dissapointed with the interface.
The merchanics are a big concerning also. The app encourages you to punch as fast as you can to increase your score. This has you whipping your arms around like crazy. I am sure this puts undue strain on the joints, ligaments etc. Especially in the shoulders. Poorly thought out...very very disappointing. I want BoxVR back, the app I paid for. I would not pay for this given the choice."
2728,Chad Lawson,"Jul 31, 2020 at 7:03 PM",1,I want my BoxVR back,"I purchased my Quest about three months ago and BoxVR was one of the first games I purchased. Aside from some issues where a clear hit was marked as a miss, I've enjoyed the game.

Then... I don't know. Either you started looking at other games out there like Supernatural and thought they were better than you or something. But your latest didn't just fix a couple of glitches (though it seems to have done so), it also broke the spirit of the game.

When one works out in real life, you don't do all arm days or all leg days. Even if it wouldn't do more harm than good, it would be boring as snot. I had four games in my workout rotation and on any given day I played two of them. 

I liked BoxVR in my rotation because it felt like I was walking into a gym locker room and getting ready. The (two left-most) workout space choices I had felt like possible real world spaces, albeit a lot nicer than anything I could afford.

But the new game? I can get the new look and feel from any number of games I already have like Beat Saber or Synth Riders. The idea of having a coach or being in a group? I get that from Supernatural a couple times a week.

Everything I liked about BoxVR was destroyed in the change to FitXR in some misguided attempt to do more rather than fix the awesome thing that you had.

BoxVR was part of my workout routine three or four times per week. FitXR has already been deleted from my Quest.

If you really do have tons of feedback from people saying that this is what they wanted in terms of feel and interface, so be it. But I seriously doubt I'm the only one you upset with this move. Please consider keeping the hit-box fixes then splitting into two games and see which is more popular."
2729,Bob,"Sep 1, 2020 at 4:43 AM",5,Best update ever,"THANK YOU for the update, what a beautiful game now.  

The new stadium and graphics are gorgeous.  

The levels by Ianthe are so clever and musical and fun, please let her do more!

And the new music selection (at least in Electronic, where I‚Äôve been) is a huge improvement.

One issue I do continue to have is accuracy and lag.  I‚Äôm on an oculus quest.  It misses hits and mis-measures force and my streaks die.  I know it‚Äôs something about this particular game since it doesn‚Äôt happen in others.  

But small price to pay for such a great experience and great workouts.  Thanks again."
2730,Kristian,"Aug 2, 2020 at 1:04 PM",4,Feels good now!,"Updated review:

Fair enough I got a super fast response to my complaints from the developers. Because of their explanation I gave it a try anyway. Well, and I have to admit I really like the new style. I just did some short workouts, so I don‚Äòt have tested it thoroughly by now. But I don‚Äòt have any problems with exploding orbs or anything making it less playable than in the original version. It feels pretty fluent and to me it looks better than before. My understanding is the developers plan to improve the experience in future updates. And they already delivered with one ‚Äûfeature‚Äú: you can turn off squats in the workouts. This is very important to people with knee issues. Also it is already translated into some foreign languages.
So whilst liking it already I‚Äòm looking forward to the updates ahead. I‚Äôll be updating this review. LetÀãs see if they can get the fifth star from me...



Why do I have to give out my email address to play the new version? I bought it as Box Vr and now I can‚Äòt use it without giving the developer some data? I‚Äòd ask for a refund if I could right now. And then I read other reviews saying it‚Äòs not the same and less fun now. I‚Äôm always open for changes, but this really feels like you‚Äôre killing it. At this point I don‚Äôt have any curiosity how the update plays. Also, I‚Äòm the kind of guy who buys expansions if I see some added value in them, but not like this.
The two stars are for the underlying Box Vr. It would‚Äôve gotten at least 4 stars by me a few weeks ago.

If I can run and play it without having to register my email I‚Äòll try again."
2731,David Ark,"Sep 1, 2020 at 6:25 AM",3,I just tried the new version of BoxVR...,"I'm gonna start with the bad because I'm frankly disappointed that we weren't even told the game was going to be changed so much and we (the ones that had already paid for it didn't have a word on the changes)
 First off, let me tell you that your previous version didn't need a massive overhaul. Maybe a few changes here and there but not all this. I know there's a lot of games out there that are doing what you tried to do with FitXR visually, and I think that was the first mistake. I really enjoyed the game the way it was, not only because it was more focused on the workout than in the graphics but because I used to play BoxVR for an hour and a half non stop and I felt sick after 15 minutes of FitXR. 
Trust me, all those visual upgrades weren't necessary. The huge rings displayed after a perfect punch, the sparks generated by the destroyed objects. Those things are way too much and the graphic quality they have don't make them justice. And since you are seeing them at least a few hundred times per round, it's not a good experience. The old interface was colorful and full of light, so gym-like. The Menus were much clearer and user friendly.  One of the things you should add as soon as possible is a particle effects reduction option. Otherwise me and I'm sure many other users won't be able to have extended sessions anymore.

Another complain is that there are songs that are outsynced to the punches. I've noticed this in a favorite song of mine: Cold as ice on the pop section. The first song is really out of tempo and I have to step forward out of the standing stance  to fix this. I'm a musician so I can't tolerate punching out of tempo. It ruins my experience. 

Now this: Please add an actual Pause feature! After a song is over I press the menu button and the options to fix settings or quit appear, but the objects keep coming. This bothers me because sometimes I have to do something quickly before continuing with the workout, fixing the headstraps, adjusting volume, opening a window, etcetera. And the fact that your pause function is bugged has been there in both BoxVR and FitXR versions. 



Now, the good: 
The new fists are much more comfortable to see and handle, and easier to know exactly where your punch is gonna land. 

The graphic design of the crouch movement is really nice. I like it and doesn't feel like too much like the old orange bars.

Those are the only two things I liked so far. I wouldn't like to have this game collecting dust because it's not what I used to enjoy. 

Thank you."

I like the environments in the old Box VR and the layout. Now it seems the same all throughout the new update of the game. Secondly to get a streak you have to pull your shoulders to even get a combo of 15, I'm hitting over 7.0 on hooks, jabs and Right hand but still it knocks me down for a streak. I preferred the old method, when it scores you on how hard you hit but still get the streak when hitting the pad. That shouldn't of changed. 

In conclusion bring back the old Box VR or change the streak system."

2737,Capn,"Jul 31, 2020 at 10:54 PM",2,BoxVR changed into FITxr... why!?!,"Let me start by saying that I LOVED boxvr. It had some issues and could definitely use certain changes, but I played it every single day for months. It's been a huge part of my weight loss journey. I don't understand why they had to change everything so much.

Positives: It's harder to maintain a streak than previously which makes it a sweatier workout. There are still some great songs.

Negatives: You can't pick the environment. I personally liked the real-look gym in boxvr because it didn't give me a headache like the new one with the darkness and neon lights. You can't put in personalized stats like weight and height so the calorie count is ridiculously inaccurate. You're supposed to be able to box with other players but every time I did the others would stop tallying or moving about halfway through. You can't select songs and make custom playlists like before and the whole screen selection page for the classes isn't as well organized as before.

I was hoping that with boxvr they would do an update where you could scroll through and pick songs one at a time (like DDR) instead of having to make a playlist. I didn't expect them to just get rid of that altogether.

Overall this new update is disappointing to say the least. If the game had been like this initially I probably never would have bought it. Please bring back a classic mode for those of us that paid for BoxVR. This is ridiculous."

Ever since the new update the hand tracking is off, hands float away, disappear or ever stay in the same spot. I have tried this app several times trying different options such as a reset of the Oculus, changing the batteries in each controller, and even making sure the Oculus was fully charged before trying it again. This is even after uninstalling the app and re-installing it. Just to be on the safe I tried several games after experiencing the tracking issue in this app and could not replicate the tracking problem in other games, including Beat Saber. What happened? üòî"

Email required for an account isn‚Äôt cool, why do I need an account? And it says you can opt out of marketing, but if I‚Äôm entering my email I want to make sure I don‚Äôt opt in ever even for a second. 

Where did Mandarin support go? Was one of the compelling features for my bilingual wife and my mother in law who only understands Mandarin. I literally bought BoxVR for them, so I hope that is coming back. 

Tracking is decent, but doesn‚Äôt feel different than before. 

The stages look nice, but the daylight feel of BoxVR was preferable for me. Don‚Äôt know why there are others in the stage, doesn‚Äôt seem to contribute anything. 

Mostly this is a bizarre switch out of an app we already bought. On one hand you‚Äôre trying to deliver value without recharging your customers, a good intent. On the other, you‚Äôre locking us out of the app we decided to purchase and into an experience with missing features. :/"

Was my go to workout first thing in the morning during lockdown. Have always enjoyed Boxercise classes and this felt totally natural when I couldn't physically go to a gym. I don't dislike games like beatsaber and audioshield but this filled the gap they didn't. Seems to me you have just tried to turn it into a video game which is totally contradictory to your statement of being focused on fitness. Not for me anymore and will be contacting the oculus store and asking for a refund. This is not the game I bought. Am very confused why you haven't just released this as a different game... I think your target customer is completely different for this.

So does the leaderboard mechanism. But they have registered the game as having ""multiplayer"" which it DOESN'T, therefore one star for dishonest marketing.

Pros:
- New streak mechanic makes me work hard
- Leaderboard thing during workouts
- Overhauled visuals

Cons:
- Marketed as having multiplayer, which it DOESN'T. It has a glorified/animated leaderboard. If they had marketed this as a singleplayer game with a cool leaderboard mechanism, then it would be OK.
Btw, don't try to justify it being called multiplayer by mentioning player recordings.
- Bots are too far back
- Have to give them your email address
- Only works if your online
- Removed beloved features without asking people
- Replaced a game people actually paid for without asking people
- Only a single DARK environment. Please add some outdoor, sunny workout locations.
- WORST HIT REGISTRATION IN THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY. This part is probably the worst, because all the wrongly registered ""misses"" are very demotivating when giving it your all."
2753,scifi_taoist,"Sep 4, 2020 at 2:47 AM",3,What A Workout!,"Updating my review since it went from BoxVR to FitVR. Not liking the new version as much. I gave it several tries and it just isn‚Äôt as fun. Streaks are dang near impossible. I seem to be hitting the targets, but then it says I‚Äôm at 0? The targets don‚Äôt feel like they flow with the music like they did before. I preferred the old style and environments. There appears to only be one now and it gets old fast.

This game used to be my go-to alternative cardio option and now I‚Äôm just not enthused about it.

Overall, I really love this game! It makes cardio workouts a lot of fun! I do wish each workout said its skill level. I agree with another reviewer who said other dojos, like in nature, would be awesome. I have found the game a little buggy. Sometimes it crashes and I have to reset the headset.

Then the update happened where they randomly switched the game to FitXR and they removed among other things offline play. I now can no longer play the game I purchased when I have the opportunity to work out. I also had pitched VR headsets to my colleagues and BoxVR specifically so they could also exercise recreationally on occasion. So now myself and the 5 other Soldiers I had convinced to purchase a quest headset cannot play this game. Instead of the word of mouth advertising I was providing free of charge I am now warning people away from this game. 

This is my first review. I figured out how to write reviews for VR games solely to express my outrage at this bait and switch removal of features I had paid for. Fix your game or revert it to what I purchased. There should be a class action lawsuit against what this company did.

2756,Eve,"Aug 3, 2020 at 2:42 PM",1,Terrible Update,"I used to play this game daily as part of my VR workout but the new update has completely changed the game and it‚Äôs just not fun anymore. The interface looks slicker but there‚Äôs much less content, so it‚Äôs hard to see this as an improvement when players get less of a game. 

The developers have removed custom environments and custom playlists. This was the main reason I purchased the game in the first place, being able to build your own workouts, choosing the music and intensity level kept the game fun on a daily basis. Some of the music is just terrible and there are now only a handful of intensive workouts to choose from so it gets boring very quickly.

I find it hard to believe that the new features are actually things players requested. Yes the new interface is better and it‚Äôs nice to be able to filter and favourite workouts these are genuine improvements. But making players create an account and forcing them to play in online mode, before we can access a game that we bought without these restrictions is not cool at all. Also the new explosions when punching and the voiceover are just cheesy and annoying. Please at least let players turn these features off if they want to, they‚Äôre distracting. 

I really hope that the developers listen to their players and bring back some of the features that have been removed in the next update. There have been a lot of negative reviews since the game updated. 

I really don‚Äôt recommend purchasing this game anymore, there‚Äôs not enough content to keep it fun and engaging and there are just far better boxing and rhythm games out there that are worth spending money on."

I gonna deinstall it and install the old apk from some other source. Congratulations. You played yourself. Btw ,after changing such a major thing I demand a full refund. I do not comply with the new terms and conditions and want you to delete everything you collected from me so far. 


I am upset. How can you fail with such an app"
2758,Springbird16,"Aug 4, 2020 at 4:00 AM",1,Where is the game I bought?,"I feel as many others do - robbed. This most recent update is essentially an entirely new game, one I would have returned. I liked the realistic environments, the interface, and the custom playlists in BoxVR. I hate the new (and now only) gym, the stats are wildly inaccurate and content is online only. That the developers felt they could remove the features that drew many to the game and replace them with a completely different (and far inferior) experience is shocking."
2759,Mart,"Aug 10, 2020 at 12:57 AM",5,It is now a proper workout,"I am not going to knock stars off because I have lost BoxVR, nor am I going to knock stars off because this game was probably released too early before bugs were ironed out. I can see where others are coming from, but to me it is clear that things are taking off in a whole new, better direction with the overhaul.

I use my Oculus Quest almost entirely for working out, and this is a game changer. The punch speed meter and the need to put more effort in to the punches continuously to get streaks means I am now seeing a calorie burn rate that matches Thrill of the Fight (I monitor my calories with an app and a heart rate monitor) - but it can also be used for lighter workouts by dropping the intensity, or by not going for the streaks. It is really good for HIIT as you can go for the streaks for short stretches, and combine this with lighter punches so you are not over-doing it. Of course there are still squats, lunges and blocks, but now as the punches cry out for so much more effort, the workout is a lot more whole body than before.

Yes, I want to see options to change things such as graphical effects (although I actually prefer the changes and effects), an accurate calorie counter (although most of us with the fitness bug have got other means for this), more environments, better multi-player support with bug fixes, more social interaction possibilities, and heck dare I say, an optional realistically priced subscription model that provides regular updated content, live coaching sessions etc would fit well for this type of game.

It was a brave move to change the game so much, and yes for the nostalgic amongst us, a classic BoxVR option would be an idea, and might certainly resolve the complaints that I can see from some about the change - but I certainly would not want to go back.

FitXR devs - take note from the negative reviews as most of them do have valid points, but please don't reverse what you are doing, as I can see a good thing that will get so much better!"
2760,Shannon,"Aug 4, 2020 at 6:57 AM",1,Was Good exercise until they changed it,"I love that it counts the calories you burn. It really gives me a good work out. And my muscles are even sore after. 

Update 8/1/20:
I played this games everyday since I got it. In all that time I may have skipped a total of 20-30 days. I average 45-60 min a day and loved watching the calories burn. It was fun and the only way I have ever been able to be disciplined about regular exercise. I hate exercising normally. And having disk and spine complications it is hard for me to exercise without hurting my back. But boxvr slowed me to do so. I lost nearly 20 pounds. I went from a size 12 to a size 8!!!!

2761,Jk,"Aug 24, 2020 at 12:07 AM",2,The change from BoxVR makes FitXR bad,"I actually enjoyed exercising when play BoxVR, but now I don‚Äôt enjoy it.  I am pretty disappointed.  Box VR let me put together a custom work out based on songs that I choose.  There are some pretty cool songs but I find most of them to be like some generic 2nd string pop music.  So Fit XR removes the ability to create a playlist out of the songs they have.  Now with FitXR you have to play using their premade work outs and listen to their playlist.  Again I remind you that there are a lot of garbage songs in this game.  This was where it was nice to play with all the songs that don‚Äôt suck.  

All in all, the changes made switch this game from being customary and a way to enjoy exercising to a dystopian communist training simulation.  It is depressing.  Unless you need to be told everything to do by someone, I don‚Äôt recommend this.  I had a better time exercising with BeatSaber.  Brighter, more interactive, and I can make a list to play with songs I enjoy"
2762,Pittcanna,"Jul 31, 2020 at 2:56 PM",3,"Fit XR Is a cluttered mess, Box VR ....","While the new UI and game looks bright and vibrant, it plays worse than the simplistic BOX VR.  It would be nice if they allowed a way to switch between the two, but ater about 40 minutes of the new UI, i am just not feeling it.

The good:
Search by intensity (Albeit vague)
Multiplayer is easier
Speed System (but this breaks the game in a way)

The Bad
Uppercut and Cross are broken now
Classes aren't sorted by time
Speed system causes missed hits
Only one environment
No survival
Didn't fix original issues, added more issues
The flow just seems off

Conclusion
Box vr was a 4 star game-Basic clean, a bit broken but forgiving enough  to at least enjoy it

Fit XR is 2 star game, most of it is eye candy, but broke the core feeling killing the enjoyment.

Glad i still have my PSVR, but tracking and visuals suck on psvr."

Please, you guys / gals, do something about the streaks. You know what I mean, same thing everyone else has been talking about. It‚Äôs impossible to progress in certain situations being you can‚Äôt stay that intense the whole time. Nothing takes the wind out of me more than to have a fantastic workout going on and a minor, if even minor, mishap takes place and I‚Äôm at zero, only to find I‚Äôm at zero quite awhile then pick back up again so I know it‚Äôs not fully fatigue.
I like the update and have been enjoying it somewhat but sometimes I wonder what is even the point of the game / workout. Is it to get a high score, be fast, get impossible streaks, punch hard, stay in as long as you can until frustration? I mean seriously. It doesn‚Äôt make sense.

This has none of the charm or things I liked about BoxVR. Only one dark room to work out in...how is this not just another music game now? The whole feel is gone. The exercises aren't as effective...I literally can feel a difference in them, it takes much more to get the workout BoxVR gave.

The halos that appear when punching are still way to big and bright. Not to mention tacky. 

I miss everything about the old version. I would not have paid for this...it should have been offered as a completely separate game. I don't know how it's legal to so drastically change what people paid for and enjoyed. 

I will avoid this company in the future and warn others of the sketchy practices. I'm so disappointed."

2770,Lionheart,"Aug 4, 2020 at 7:10 PM",1,OK but.,"I think we are being conned. 

At the start of a routine it fills up with other ""players"" all with weird bracketed names. None of them wave back to you and move extreamly genericly. Then when the fist song finishes they all freeze and become stationary. Needless to say I belive the other ""Players"" to be bots of some kind to trick you in to thinking your doing it with other people and they glitch out. 

Also the Right hand jab registration is extreamly patchy at best with my hand just going through the orb.

Update. FitXR says they arnt bots but payers who previously competed the work out. So its just displaying the previous scores. The ""Other people"" in the arena with out arnt people doing the work out with you. This ain't multiplayer its a Glorified score board. Oculus please remove the multiplayer status from this game. Its not multiplayer!! Its a lie."
2771,Jordan,"Aug 7, 2020 at 8:21 PM",3,(Updated) *Best VR Fitness Game of 2020,"TLDR: what I had concluded was an ""absolute must buy, especially if you are considering using VR to stay more active,"" is actually a gamified exercise experience that prioritizes the game over the exercise.

I was a big fan of BoxVR (FitXR used to be BoxVR) and used it almost everyday as part of a workout routine. This became incredibly important during the pandemic. While BoxVR was great, it was not without it's flaws. 

Fast forward to July 30th when BoxVR gets an entire redesign/upgrade and becomes FitXR. The team at FitXR created an entirely new application that took away many of the main features that made BoxVR so great: custom playlists, longer classes, multiple environments (especially a brighter one for accessibility), and live real-time multiplayer.


For those of you, like me, that want the most out of a VR workout experience this app is for you too. With the new update they have added a new power gauge that is essentially a ""Test Your Strength"" meter that challenges you to hit faster. This created an immediate feedback loop that had me punching harder than I ever did in BoxVR. I did one 20 minute Intense class today paying attention to the meter and by the end of the workout class I was dripping sweat. My arms were very sore, and after spending a few more days realized I was sacrificing form for speed because you have to pick faster the 4m/s for your hit to count toward a streak.

They had good intentions, but did not go about this ""update"" the way that they should've. Either refunding people and giving them the option to buy the new game again if they want to, or reverting this back to the original BoxVR and offering FitXR as a separate app."

2775,TG,"Aug 3, 2020 at 3:28 AM",1,Please bring back customization,"The new visual effects are okay and I love I can keep track of my workouts. Unfortunately with the upgrades my choice to customize my workout went away. It would be nice to be able to customize the background setting to break up the monotony and adjust to my mood. While the developers were going for a class effect it falls very short of that. The background feels like I'm walking up to weigh in on the biggest loser. As for the part were you're supposedly competing  with other people this falls extremely short as well. I could care less about robot figures with irrelevant  numbers. If you want a class feel give some options of different backgrounds. Instead of robots, actually make people in the classroom or at least the instructor that made the workout. Another huge disappointment  is there aren't as many workouts to choose from as before and you can't pick songs to make up your own playlist. The fitnessXR points are annoying. The percentage of jabs, hooks, squats etc at the end of the workout helps me know what to work on and improve my boxing. Please bring back customization."
2776,MrRob,"Aug 8, 2020 at 6:40 AM",2,Would be great... but,"Well that was short lived. On the release of the revamped app gave it 5 stars but already the problems surface. Favourite workouts saved - all disappeared. Stats reset. Weight added as a means for more ""accurate"" calorie burn calculation. One 16min workout and apparently I've burned 475 calories. Are you kidding? Don't mislead people who a) don't know any better and b) don't have something like an apple watch that's tracking calories more accurately. I burned 200 during the workout, not 475. Use any calorie calculator for boxing - actual boxing against someone, and 16mins will show around 180 calories for someone my height age and weight. Where do you come up with 475. We're stand on the spot occasionally doing a squat if the workout has them and otherwise punching thin air. It's a good workout don't get me wrong and great for a rainy day or otherwise but don't fool people into thinking they're burning more than they are.

Oh and if you're doing an update don't wipe people's stats. Wipe their favourites. And put some thought into your features. Favourites should be a category that can be sorted by so you can look for a favourite of a certain intensity or length... not end up with 20 favourites that are in a random order with only three shown on screen at a time. 

Latest release said visually upgrade to streaks as well. I got up to 325 and saw and heard no difference. How long a streak do you have to get for the new great update to kick in?

Wish there was a way to provide feedback without having to change the review too. Would actually keep it at 4 stars and give a balanced view but this seems the only way to hopefully get a developers attention."

They completely locked it down and now you can't see any individual songs and cant create custom playlists. And you have less options to customize your gloves and your backdrops than you did before. If you had boxVR, while you got the update free, they deleted your entire history.

I found the 30 min workout not as challenging as the boxVR ones. The calorie counter definitely over projected how much I burnt. Also, the workout was suppose to have squats but I didn‚Äôt get any during the session. 

I was unable to choose my online workout partner in the player list and had to enter the class with a bunch of strangers. 

Finally, my purchased boxVR add ons are now unavailable on fitXR! So, that‚Äôs money down the drain?

I do like that you can play with others but it seems that you would not be able to select to play with friends which would be my preference. I don‚Äôt understand the different levels and what that means. All in all it seems like they decided to take all the options out of the game and I want them back.

Give me BoxVR. It's that simple.

The developers have done the wrong thing by upgrading us to FitXR and not giving us both games. I would have even considered paying extra for the new game. 
The whole experience has changed. It's now a game instead of a workout.

Like others have said, it's harder to get a hit streak going, almost back breaking with the squats, too much fireworks with the hits that you can't see what's coming.
Multiplayer is fake. It's harder to find the songs you like.

The only thing you have added that was desperately needed is the favourites option. Plus I miss the old style gym where I could see the London skyline. 

Sorry, I would get a refund on this if I could. Please consider bringing back the option of the original BoxVR"

DO NOT BUY THE DLC! aside from the fact that this game constant hard crashes my quest to the point where it has to be hard reset, when you buy the DLC you would think you'd be able to play those same sequences in custom Playlists, but you CANNOT! If you add any DLC songs to a custom playlist, even on hard diffuculty you get a water down sequence not AT ALL like what's in the pre made work outs. I wish I never bought this game.

2785,Anvil,"Aug 15, 2020 at 12:35 AM",5,Hang in there...,"Updated 8/14/20 after it changed to FitXR...

It is much better.  I could not seem to get a really intense workout with the previous version, and even bought wrist weights.  This new version now provides a very intense work out.  I am gasping for air and feel it in my shoulders the next day.  This has become part of my regular workout routine.  I think the exploding punches are the key - great idea adding that.  I also like playing against the other players (they are not live, but have previously done that class).  It really gives me something to aim for while playing which was something missing from the previous version.  Well done!

Original Review for Box XR:
I came close to returning this as I just could not figure out the uppercut and the swing moves.  I just kept getting the timing wrong and it was very frustrating as I thought it was the glove adjustment.  Fortunately, I persevered and got the hang of it.  For the glove adjustment, just put your fists where they would be inside the gloves.  To hit the uppercuts and swings, just focus on the white dots.  You don't need to do anything fancy or fast, in fact you can swing quiet slowly.  Just focus on and swing at the white dot, as if you are trying to hit the front of it.  Keep going, and eventually you will get it.  Once you get it, the game is really enjoyable.  However, for me, it is more of just a workout than a game.  There is a score you get, but it has no context unless you know your previous score on the same workout or are competing against someone.  I try different workouts each time, so the score is meaningless, as is getting so many hits in a row.  I have been playing TOTF, but as a workout, it can be too intense for times when I want something a little slower.  If I want a steady 45 - 60 min workout then it is BoxVR.  If I want a HIIT for 30 mins or less then it is TOTF.  All-in-all a great workout app."
2786,theodore.lindsay,"Aug 15, 2020 at 4:31 PM",5,Huge improvement!,"tl;dr: the new upgrade takes this from another attempt at a workout video game to something that is much closer to an actual sport!

So I‚Äôve been waiting for a long time for someone to figure out how to take the addictive imagination of video games and meld it to the physicality of actual sports. With this upgrade I think the game may have gotten close to that.

I actually purchased my quest because I had heard about this game ‚Äòsupernatural‚Äô and thought it might be what I‚Äôve been hoping for.  I actually discovered boxvr after I got my quest. Both games have been a lot of fun- but unfortunately without any feedback for swinging or hitting harder, my motor system would quickly ‚Äòlearn‚Äô how to cheat and play the game using just flicking and minimal effort - no matter how conscious I was about this,  it still happened - and the physical component of the game would quickly pieter out. After all, this is what motor learning is supposed to do..

Two new additions to the game finally address this: (1) If you swing hard you get immediate feedback with an exploding target - providing instant satisfaction for the added effort. (2) The game keeps tracks of streaks of fast swings - reminding you not to shirk off when you‚Äôre getting tired. 

Before this feedback, the game still felt like any old video game where the physics of your body and and the physics of the game were somewhat disconnected. Imagine if you were playing tennis and the ball went over the net at the same speed no matter how hard you swung.. only at the end of a set you might get some extra points for power. 

I‚Äôm really having fun playing the new upgrade. I still think there might be even more ways to tightly couple the player kinematics with the game dynamics, but perhaps there is a limitation in the quest hardware. More challenging game sequences would also be welcome, but overall really excited about where they are taking the game."
2787,Sakura,"Aug 1, 2020 at 4:43 AM",2,Updated Now Discouraged,"Yikes. I get updates are needed and expected but this was no update. This was a full overhaul to something that was working! 

I was absolutely enjoying BoxVR, always putting in a min of an hour in, some day‚Äôs pushing 1.5 because I enjoyed it so much. Now the update has made the targets even more difficult to hit and the even though I would hit the targets, the streak would always reset to zero. The squatting object seems to be even lower than before. The gloves are, well, non existent. Also, there‚Äôs still no way to calibrate height and squats to the user. 

I only put in 5 mins today and turned it off. It‚Äôs frustrating and very discouraging being I even paid into packs that was enjoying and now I feel defeated before I even get a minute in."
2788,Gunner McQuaid,"Aug 15, 2020 at 8:46 PM",2,Not what i hoped for,"I should have listened to the reviews wanting the old boxvr back. The music is terrible. There arent a lot of options - you have to buy more ‚Äòpacks‚Äô and the tech doesnt work like boxing. Having trained in boxing classes if you try and hot the marks like you are supposed to you often miss. Many of the hits don‚Äôt register in the ‚Äògame‚Äô. If you treat it like beat saber and play with less physical activity and no actual boxing form you can score higher but you get less activity and will hurt your form. 
Needs major updates. Also the calorie counter is WAY off. It doesnt link to a fit watch which is a huge problem for an app like this. My watch reports about half the burned calories that the app always say i burned. This needs taken off until the app can properly link to a watch. Very miss leading. 
I hope they update the tech and make it more boxing accurate. I get the music is terrible because of licensing so im willing to put up with that as long as they fix the tech."

They REALLY need to fix the problems with not detecting some hooks and uppercuts. It‚Äôs so frustrating when halfway through a workout when you are working on a streak all of a sudden you will score 6 or more consecutive whiffs on those punch types, even though you are punching them exactly the same as you were earlier.  There is something deeply flawed with the engine for this game.  Please invest deeply in fixing it and you will have a 5 star game."

2792,darrenf,"Aug 24, 2020 at 12:56 AM",5,My favourite home boxing workout,"I‚Äôll preface this by stating I never used this app in its BoxVR incarnation, so my review is aimed solely on FitXR in itself - without comparison to what came before.

I come to this game having done boxing workouts at home for years - predominantly with the Moov Now wristbands, and Fitness Boxing on the Nintendo Switch. I find FitXR to provide a much, much more strenuous and effective workout than either of those.

It‚Äôs not perfect - I‚Äôve had several routines where the ‚Äúinstructor‚Äù doesn‚Äôt speak, and also a few ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù classes have been more exhausting than the ‚Äúintense‚Äù ones. But these are not, for me at least, concerns worth dropping a star from my score. I find the music entertaining in all genres, the variations of patterns enough to keep me on my toes, and have no trouble keeping streaks of 200+ each time out.

My biggest issue is that with a headset on I find it occasionally tricky to maintain proper form, and forget to pivot my rear foot/move my lower body - but that feels intrinsic to VR rather than FitXR. The fact that my punches actually connect with a target more than makes up for it, instead of basically being ‚ÄúGuitar Hero for fists‚Äù on the Moov/Switch.

I am now loving my boxing, for 50+ minutes 4+ times a week, which I could rarely maintain motivation for before."
2793,ZaWanderer,"Sep 19, 2020 at 5:15 AM",4,Looks refined. missing boxing metrics.,"I am new to this game, it changed from 2 days ago. Looks more refined, but the previous one had more metrics for boxing.  Jab, uppercut, hooks, squat,etc..

Also it is frustrating sometimes to miss a perfectly valid punch. I have to trust my ears and hit the beat sync more ignore the visual clue. This really throws me off when it happens on oculus quest"
2794,Edo,"Aug 5, 2020 at 5:25 PM",2,Where‚Äôs my gym?!,"It‚Äôs sad that they can just swap out the app you purchased for some Tron wannabe, overly effects heavy knockoff.  I get that the core activity is fundamentally the same as before, but so much of VR is about immersion, and I chose BoxVR because of the look and feel of the original gym.  Overall the new power meters coupled with the streak mechanics make this version feel much more judgemental than the previous BoxVR experience.  I find it demoralizing and it makes me not want to come back.  I find it somewhat appalling that they were allowed to pull a bait and switch like this.  Please give me the option to play the original"

When you sell a software
1) you Cant remove all about an existing user and ask again to enter account infos 
2) you cant propose less functionalitities than the previous paid software. (No more different  training room, all my personal trainings have disappear) 
3) have a minimum of possible conf. For example,disabling  visual effects that can be very tiring when you box a long time.
Changing some colors at room level. (Some people can have problem seeing some colors). 
So, a very deceiving version that restrict completly the game.  Adding some visual dont change this fact..

We did quite a few workouts together and were super excited to hop into the new update and do some more workouts together but struck with sadness and anger when we found out that all the active multiplayer aspects were cut for a ghost multiplayer where you play against previous peoples scores. This would be fine if i bought this game to play alone but the fact that they outright removed the only reason i bought this game just makes me want to refund it which i can‚Äôt at this point.

2809,sofa.h,"Aug 18, 2020 at 4:07 AM",1,No Multiplayer Function Anymore,"Although the update has been wanted in some ways, such as the better tracking with punches overall, my main reason for purchasing this application has been taken away. My boyfriend and I both bought this game to do workouts together which BoxVR enabled us to do even though we couldn‚Äôt physically see each other, especially because I wanted to stay active during the stay at home orders. FitXR has changed that so the multiplayer is only with other players‚Äô ghost scores rather than with live players. This is no longer the game I purchased and I can no longer exercise with friends which was the whole reason for buying BoxVR. I do not appreciate this transformation as it killed off one of the better features in my opinion and still misleads on the store as a multiplayer game, when there is no real-time multiplayer function."

I do notice that in class mode that most stop after one song. I like the head to head challenge of the class and honestly I think it makes me work harder.

   Box VR was one of my staple exercise games. I'm blown away by the update. All of the graphics and UI have been fully overhauled, and it didn't cost me an additional dime! 
    From what I can tell they incorporated in many quality of Life upgrades I'm sure players were asking for. 
    First impressions of game play. The hit zones are improved and feel much more natural. They also put in a hit meter at the bottom middle to show how hard you hit the note and encourage you to really punch hard. 
     Multiplayer. I didn't care. whatever. That said, seeing 6 people next to me swinging and a leader board with my name slated against the other people in the room really upped the game for me. I found myself focusing harder to get long combos to top the board :)
      On a down side, I'm not sure how solid the multiplayer is. of the  workouts I did just now only one seemed to work smoothly. The other two workouts (one with 1 other person and one with 6 other people) It seemed like they all got dropped out pretty quick and their scores stopped updating.

2820,mcaldus,"Aug 7, 2020 at 10:42 AM",1,Not very good at all,"I bought a game called Boxvr, which was quite good, but then it was swapped with a different game, which is not very good. Daylight robbery by the developer it would seem.

You can see under my OLD REVIEW, WHICH APPLIES TO BOX VR, NOT THIS NEW GAME


BOX VR Is the app I spent most time with on the Quest, and one main reason I am happy to have it. I do get many work breaks and cramming one hour total in per day using time I would have mostly wasted is fantastic.
My wife, who is not particularly into VR, spends tons of time with it too (I bought initially for her, since she enjoys cardio kickboxing).
I am not sure how exact the calories count is, but, if practised with good form and intensity, it is a very good aerobic exercise. I end up sweating profusely, feel better afterwards, action is intense enough not to feel the effort, mostly, which is the whole point.
Compared to the various Beat Saber, ping pong, racket, wich are all no doubt entertaining, this is a way more effective exercising app, less of  a game.

This for the positive, and honestly it sounds like a piece of advertising.

NEUTRAL POINTS
Detection is good. Most of times I feel that if I miss a target, it was because of bad form.
However, occasionally I feel there is some problem.
Also, at times I am not sure how to score higher, which motivates me, it does not seem it correlates all the time with correct timing, speed of the punch and width of the swing, some additional info in game would be nice.

NEGATIVE POINTS
II do not expect concert level but many songs' lyrics are truly awful to the point of being distracting from the workout. 
It would be good to be able to import songs and rate trainings so I remember what I liked.

Workout tracking: 
I like to track my workouts, write length of sessions, calories, frequency. Exercising entirely with a computer on my face and not having this done automatically is ridicolous!
I would like at the very least an optional record of my sessions in calendar format  with minutes/calories, ability to summarize by time period. Ideally some graphs or at least an export option to do my own tracking. 
Also, please display the name of the workout at the end,  after 26 minutes of punching I will not remember it."
2821,Drinkthepurplestuff,"Aug 15, 2020 at 5:58 AM",2,Update has horrible hit detection,"The updated app has a nice clean look to it. It has a more challenging feel to it. There are a couple of problems. 

1. Hit detection is trash right now. It seems very arbitrary at times. Especially the uppercuts.  This should be their highest priority as pretty much everyone on the Facebook group is complaining about it. 


2. No way to work out with a friend like before. I also think most of the people you do see in a group session are just bots."
2822,Moosalie,"Aug 10, 2020 at 8:44 PM",2,Love it (Update: don‚Äòt love it anymore),"Update after BoxVR was renamed and re-branded:

The update is really bad in my opinion. I was really happy about BoxVR since the other, similar apps were trying to be too ‚Äûfuturistic‚Äú. Now you jumped the train with the visuals. The navigation is way harder than before. Also why would I care how fast/strong I punch in the air? The multiplayer is also nonsense. I was about to buy more packages/addons, but I don‚Äòt like to use this app anymore. Bring back the old gym and interface and improve slightly from there. You guys lost me as a user. Really sad about this. :/

First review:

My wife wanted to buy it, I was rather skeptical. You know... physical activity and stuff. :) But I tried it and it‚Äòs actually fun. And can be exhausting. But that‚Äôs ok. I play at least once a day and still like it a lot. Highly recommended. üëç"

2833,Alex,"Aug 14, 2020 at 5:54 AM",2,Used to be better,"This new version is quite a step backwards. 

*an email address is required, to which they will send you marketing emails.

*There's only 1 ""intense"" level class in the ""long"" duration category and overall far less content.
*The new environment is not as nice as the previous, and cannot be changed.

Thankfully with this version we have no issues with that, except when we workout with the ghosts it glitches occasionally so we only do solo play. We personally love the whole revamp. Definitely can use different environments but our issue is with the streaks, they only count the explosive hits. What about the normal people who cant do explosive hits all the time? Where is the accuracy hits counter like in the old game? I'm a disabled Vet with torn rotator cuffs so explosive hits each time is not gonna happen. This is great home cardio for us but with no satisfaction of our accuracy. We want to see a streak of how many total targets we hit while playing not just explosive hits.
UPDATE* Thanks for the quick reply but, it's not about losing the streak, not everyone is interested in maxing out explosive hit streaks. Add normal hit and squat streaks as well. Plus add a mirror in one of your new environments for solo mode, you know how conceited humans are. Workout areas need mirrors lol. Thanks again."

2840,NivkePA,"Aug 7, 2020 at 5:19 PM",5,"Great update, thank you!","This was originally for my Box VR review, but with the change to FitXR wanted to update.  This is a wonderful update (especially for free), that puts it on par with other apps now.  Box VR was great, but really looked dated and basic.  No more, with a fresh new interface and features, it is much improved while still keeping all the core workout mechanics that made Box VR great.  I LOVE this workout!  Thank you, great job!  Just buy it already...

ONE REQUEST, please add heart rate monitor support (e.g. Apple Watch).  This is a critical feature in Supernatural that would make FitXR kick it‚Äôs butt.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I love this game, great workout ‚Äî this is reason enough to have purchased the Quest.  New DLC pack is very good, but I think a little expensive for only 1 hr of new content.  But looking forward to future installments none the less."
2841,Kien,"Aug 6, 2020 at 11:42 AM",3,Streak Counter Misleading,"Overall, there are some nice updates to this launch version of BoxVR‚Äôs rebranding to FitVR. Graphics look slightly better in some areas. It looks more like a proper fitness studio‚Äôs app. A few of the mechanics have been changed from earlier versions to make it easier to hit hooks and uppercuts. I‚Äôve yet to go through all the workouts to say if they are better. 

What really bugs me is that as a real boxer, I get dinged for proper techniques and hits and rewarded if I swing like I‚Äôm playing Beat Saber. 

The streak counter is NOT a streak counter. It‚Äôs an EXPLOSIVE streak counter. Not that I would keep that in mind when it‚Äôs one of the two main status indicators during the game. It‚Äôs pretty disheartening to look up occasionally and see my streak continually going back to zero when I haven‚Äôt missed anything. 

I get the idea of encouraging you to hit faster and harder. It also doesn‚Äôt make sense when you are boxing and there is a sequence of 3 jabs and a cross. You load up on the cross and take measured jabs. Instead I have to take full swings for the jabs and take the bad form to keep the streak. 

I found that I can always get the uppercut if I just slap upwards instead of cutting upwards with good form. I don‚Äôt think you should be rewarded only if you are trying to do a street fighter RYU style flying uppercut. When I hit your chin, I pull back and reset. I don‚Äôt swing through EVERYTIME. 

I get it. This is a game. There are no techniques being taught. You aren‚Äôt expected to be a boxer. Still, if I wanted to swing fast and wild like in beat saber, I would just play beat saber. 

Take the scoring off completely then. What is the point of leaderboards and record keeping if I can game the score. 

Am I sweating? Of course, there is no disputing that. Just don‚Äôt make me think I‚Äôm doing something wrong when my counter constantly resets to zero when I hit everything. 

Simple fix guys. You had a lead-up to the launch. Play and UI testing should have brought some attention to this instead of waiting for EVERY review to be pointing out the same problem."
2842,Bob,"Aug 7, 2020 at 10:50 PM",3,Disappointing Update; took content away,"First of all, this isn't so much of an update as a completely new program.  They took away a ton of content and didn't add that much.  The new version has promise and I'm sure they'll add more content (hopefully not in the format of paid DLC's only) but as of right now we lost a lot more than we gained.  Should have been a newly released app not an ""update.""  BoxVR was pretty great.  This isn't as good.  Feel like I'm getting ripped off.

The Good:
- The social/group dynamic is nice.  Competing against others for high score adds extra motivation.
- The hit speed gauge is a nice feature.  Let's you know how hard you're hitting the targets.
- Ability to turn set squats on or off per class

The Bad:
- Removal of custom playlists.  This is my biggest complaint.  I had songs that I liked.  There was also a much greater variety than what there is now.  So much good content was taken away.  I don't like being forced to choose a pre-built ""class"".  Custom playlists let me setup different lengths of workouts that I wanted.
- There's now only one environment for playing.  Used to have a few to pick from which was nice.
- New streak goals only count when making extra-strong hits.  You can hit all the targets but if just one isn't an extra-hard hit, it resets your streak.  Streak shouldn't reset with a missed extra-hard hit but only for a missed hit.  Hitting a target but being just under it counting as an extra hard hit is very frustrating and makes me not want to play.  Wish I could just turn that feature off if that's how it's going to be.

What Could Make I Better:
- Bring back custom playlists.
- Ability to toggle streak counter on/off or makes it so that it doesn't just track extra hard hits only
- Add more than one boxing environment
- Add option to bring boxing gloves back

Used to be five stars -- now only three  :-("
2843,Darksteele,"Aug 7, 2020 at 8:20 PM",3,Never seen such a change before,"Edit to three stars: I gave FitXR two more chances and it still bothers me, how it replaced BoxVR. However, it is a reasonably good cardio workout and at the end of the day that's what counts for me. BoxVR would have gotten 5 stars. We will see where FitXR is headed, today's update was a start for the better.
Facebook was willing to refund me the money I spent. Thumbs up for the Oculus Support on that! I refused, because I really got great results by using this workout and that is worth the money.

------ old 1-star text ------
This change to FitXR absolutely kills the experience for me.
I loved BoxVR. I lost 13 kilogramms in ~4 months. It was perfect for me, I had hours over hours of ""gametime"" since April
With FitXR I tried 4 sessions (of about 30 minutes) so far and I do not want to continue. I am losing interest in this kind of software. I even discovered myself to yell at the ""trainer"" in the session to ""shut the f* up!""; their interludes are so annoying.
I will switch back to Beatsaber, which I used to exercise the first three weeks, before I discovered BoxVR.
I am sad and angry about it. BoxVR in its form before this awful update was such a great motivation to exercise.

Worst thing: they just exchanged the software I bought completely. How is that even possible?"
2844,Niall,"Aug 1, 2020 at 1:02 PM",1,My hand hurts,"I bought this back when it was called BoxVR, and I loved it (five start love). However, while there's a lot of good stuff in the update, they have, all in all, ruined it.

First up, the ""encouragement"" from the ""trainers"" is so artificial and divorced from the context that I'm in that it seriously degrades the experience. There's probably an option to switch it off, but I can't be bothered looking, because this isn't the most serious problem.

Secondly, the change of scoring encourages me to do things that I don't think are safe. In BoxVR, I was cautious to avoid accidentally overextending my arms during punches. Why? Well if you're not punching anything, there's nothing stopping your motion, except your own tendons and joints. Pulling your punches is punishing on tendons, and letting your punch fly through until the joint stops wears the joints. I find myself putting more into it, and I'm worried I'll injure myself.

But the killer is my final issue. In all my time using BoxVR (and I was using it daily for a couple of months) I don't recall ever once punching my headset. But I played FitXR yesterday for the first time, and a right uppercut saw my whack myself so hard on the headset that it took a chunk out of my little finger. I played it again this morning and the same thing happened, and now I've got two holes scabbing over.

You could blame me, say I wasn't being careful, but I'm not the one that has changed -- the game is. The timing of the game, the beats you're supposed to be matching, that's leading me to wait until things are closer to me to hit them, and the encouragement to put extra power in means that when things go inevitably wrong, it hurts."
2845,Garagecrafter,"Aug 3, 2020 at 4:33 AM",1,Not the program I bought,I hate the way that the developers pulled this switch on us - and the way that Oculus allowed it to happen.

2846,Stevie Weevie,"Aug 5, 2020 at 1:49 AM",2,BoxVR Owners Lost Features,"I'm giving 2 of 5 stars because I'm a BoxVR Owner that knows what features were removed in what was marketed as an upgrade to FitXR. BoxVR owners were automatically ""upgraded"" to FitXR, with no ability to keep using what they originally paid for. If you didn't experience BoxVR you won't know what you never experienced, however, I'm sure at some point you will want what was in BoxVR... to be fair, you'll still get a workout.

Couple thoughts on the ""upgrade"" from BOX VR which I bought a week prior to the forced update.

- I like the hit meter. Helps motivation wise.
- Would like more environments including more realistic, less arcade like rooms like what was in BOX VR. airy roomy well lit gym. 
- seems like there are less free workouts to choose from then what was available in BOX VR? why?
- custom workouts is gone. Why? and if this is was rebuilt on an entirely new platform, will it be added back in? If so when? If not, that's what original BOX VR owners paid for
- I don't mind that the gloves were taken away, but it would be nice to have the option to have gloves on or off, and calibrate the gloves. For me this isn't a deal breaker, but calibrating might be helpful depending how people hold their controllers.
- Thought multi-player was truly multi-player and I can invite my friend, etc... Doesn't appear that's the case? I haven't tinkered with this that much yet. 
- I've heard issues registering hits, seems like it is ok on my end with the couple workouts I did, but I need to play for...

Overall, IMHO upgrades are supposed to be additive, and address bugs, performance issues, etc. not remove features. 

I'll get a workout, but those who purchased Box VR lost more then they gained."

I‚Äôm giving this three stars solely because I loved the previous version, perhaps hoping that we‚Äôll get the option of ‚Äúdowngrading‚Äù back to BoxVR. Despite the limited music and environment selections, it was stable and reliable virtual gym. Consequently I was excited about the latest update to FitXR, looking forward to an even better experience ‚Äî a broader  playlist, compelling add-on packs, well developed environments, and fewer bugs. However, that just isn‚Äôt the case. I‚Äôve been playing FitXR since the transition last week, hoping each time that it would somehow get better. Adding to the list of complaints already shared by other users, I‚Äôve found this update  to be a letdown, degrading many facets of the experience. From the distracting freezes in multiplayer mode, the unrealistic caloric burn count, to the laggy (too often unresponsive) controllers, my once favorite app is becoming increasingly unusable. I gave up out of frustration from technical glitches too many times mid-game. I understand that FitXR has been built from the ground up. The truth is it just isn‚Äôt ready for prime time."

I've tried using FitXR into my daily exercise routine spending an hour-ish a day, 3X a week and on my treadmill the other days has kicked my butt! You won't go wrong buying this program!!!"
2851,Xariann,"Aug 14, 2020 at 3:36 PM",5,Excellent Fitness Game (FitXR update),"I finally got around to playing the updated version and I just love it. I like the new sleek design, and overall it's just more polished.

I really like the multiplayer now, I don't know if it's real time or just you against other people's replay, but you get put in a lobby with 8 other people that fills up almost instantly. It really makes you push yourself if you need that extra umph.

Solo play is still around and it's where I will spend most of the time to train, but I will set aside a periodic competition day for multiplayer to try and see how well I do.

The multiplayer session kicked my butt and I had to work really hard for second place (thanks also to a small minority of hits not registering, but I believe that was due to the Quest). 

The special effects showing that you hit with enough power are better now and give you a much clearer indication on whether you hit with a powerful enough hit, meaning that you can better adjust the intensity of the workout. You now also get a meter that shows how well you hit notes on the beat. I liked the app before, but now it's even better. I am actually happy to have bought this on two platforms as the developers deserve the purchase.

I played this on Steam during beta before getting the Oculus Quest so I have clocked quite a bit of game time.

This app has one purpose: give you an excellent cardio workout and it does that one thing very well. It's fun and it's probably the game I wind up playing the most on VR because of its simplicity, the fact that you can play it in a small place and still get an excellent workout.

Even if you stay in one place, somehow it's even more fun to play it on the Quest. Maybe it's the controller, maybe it's the fact that I am not kicking a cable away from my feet after dodging.

Anyway, if you play VR for the fitness benefits while having fun, this has you covered."

2854,ES,"Sep 3, 2020 at 6:50 PM",3,"So good, but needs better tracking","I want to like this so much. I owned it before the update, and I think the update is really good. I love the new look and feel. Other reviews have some good points about features that were removed, but generally I would be happy with this update.

My biggest issue is that the majority of my punches seem to miss. I cannot figure out where the best place to hit is, and there is not very good instruction on this. I have tried a bunch of different ways and just can't seem to get it right. This makes the gameplay very frustrating, as I spend more time trying to figure out where I'm supposed to hit and how to get that ring to explode, than enjoying the workout. That's why I hardly ever use this and just once in a while I'll decide to try it again. Only to realize that the tracking still sucks.

Please improve the tracking as well as the explanation for how you're supposed to get hits to actually count. 

I also find the consecutive hits  or streaks confusing. If you hit the ball but if it doesn't explode it sets your streak to zero. I don't quite understand that. Are you counting power hits or general hits overall?

This deserves a 4 to 4.5 rating, but I'm making it lower for now because...this app harder to enjoy or use the way it is right now.

UPDATE:

Thank you to the developers for the response. Thank you for the tips for more accurate hitting; I have tried those, but still sometimes have issues, although it does seem that it's more accurate than it used to be. I'll try again and if there are still issues, I'll send a video. In response to your explanation of the streak counter, thank you for that. However, I think it would be better to see a counter that reflects how many consecutive hits you get. Maybe you can show explosive streaks in addition to that? Updating rating as well."
2855,tbpgolden,"Aug 2, 2020 at 8:56 AM",2,Why did you change it?,Box VR was awesome the way it was. My buddy and I met online and did multilayer sessions regularly.

2856,Stefanatz,"Aug 14, 2020 at 12:50 AM",5,Excellent Overhaul!!,"I regularly played Box VR and I‚Äôm so happy with the Fit XR update.

The group workouts are super motivating and the punch meter was a much needed addition. The general user interface is great and the intensity/time filters help me find the appropriate class.

I love the spark effects when punching the orbs but it would be sweet if you amplified the effects of punching once you hit a certain amount in a row. Like flaming fists or something after 100 no misses. Graphical and audible rewards for doing well would add an extra layer of motivation. 

I would also love more environments, real time multiplayer class workout options and possibly different game types at some point. But keep perfecting what you have! Well done."
2857,Cisco,"Aug 13, 2020 at 6:32 PM",5,I like it,"I never played the OG BoxVR, so I can‚Äôt compare. I really enjoy playing this game. I work up a crazy sweat and sometimes I can‚Äôt even finish a round cause I can‚Äôt lift my arms. 

I agree with the random miss complaints. Usually with the hooks.

My only wish... I‚Äôm a not in the best shape of my life post COVID. I wish there was a way to play this in 3 minute rounds with a minute rest. The ability to set 6 rounds of three minutes would be incredible. After the 9 minute mark I usually tend to quit cause of the strain. I know I‚Äôll eventually work up the strength, but I still would love to see if I  could build up the endurance for 6-12 rounds of 3 minutes. 

Other than that... I look forward to future updates. Great job."
2858,Deadestpool,"Aug 5, 2020 at 11:23 PM",5,I was about to give 1 star first,"At first I was really angry, like all the other 1* reviewers since the update. I lost my customized workouts and highscores, didn't care so much for the environment, but found the targeting way too much off. Then I read those negative reviews and the devs responses to just about all of them. Yes, the responses were about the same when the issues pointed out were. But I have not found any issue which was not addressed and everything became pretty much repetitive after more than a hundred negative reviews. Still they respond.
They say they built this app up again from the ground and will add new AND (improved) OLD features, including customization, better menu visuals for workout lengths and personal workout completion.
The multiplayer as is only shows recordings of 6 other player's exercise and their points during their workout (so not really much difference to ""real"" multiplayer workouts, only that you cannot interact with the others), but it is currently stopping after the first track and being fixed soon. They say they will also bring back realtime multiplayer with additional content/tasks. There is too much visual feedback for perfect punches (halos and fireworks) distracting from successive targets and they acknowledged this multiple times.
This completely new app already has around 60 workouts plus a handful warm-ups and some improvements have been made, like favorite workout, sorting of workouts according to music etc. and the motivating hit meter with the streak system. 
So I was appeased and have done a few more workouts and got better in scoring, just now completed a nearly 60 minute one with a 214 max. streak.

See, before the update people have complained that this app stops being a real workout after just a few weeks when their fitness has improved or being no workout at all when they were already fit. Now, with the long workouts it is REALLY HARD to get to level 10 (some tracking issue contributes to that, though, see below). Still I got to >9.5 (less than half a circle missing) during that long workout just now. And I am sweating so much more with the constant effort to get perfect punches. My shoulder and upper arm muscles are still aching even after 2 days (my first really long workout after the update). I am now dreading the punches more than the squats and ducks, where before it has been the opposite (seems my legs are worked out well now after nearly a hundred hours of BoxVR). 
So now I see this as a new basic game with lots of possibilities which will improve over time and considering that the team seems to be really enthusiastic to address user demands and apparently already had quite some plans for future updates anyway, I give it 5 stars. There has not been any freezing which happened about every third >50min workout before. I still ""lost my glove"" once where before it suddenly floated beside my head. I hope they will still be able to address this.

There are quite a few more basic issues where improvement is required:
1. Less force/speed requirements (e.g. 50%) to achieve a perfect punch for the fastest succession of targets (2nd-fastest still manageable, but exhausting, nice workout). The team already responded several times that they are discussing this already. 
2. Complete streak reset with the first non-perfect punch is a total letdown. Better subtract 1, 2 or even 5 points from the existing streak.
3. Hits sometimes do not get registered for uppercuts, especially for the right hand. Seems the target area and/or hand movement direction have been narrowed down too much? Strangely from squatting position this works better. 
4. Everyone tries to make ALWAYS perfect punches (as it should be since it is rewarded!) and it looks to me like the FitXR team did not test the game much in that regard. Even the ""light"" workouts, especially the ones >50 minutes are getting really, really hard this way. And you need at least 30 minutes to get into a proper cardio, no matter how fit you are.
So there should be at least an easy setting for the same workouts where you score either less points or compete only with others in easy setting (in the latter case maybe for the future realtime multiplayer there should be only 1 setting per workout or you won't have any opponents if there are several ""leagues""). Even better would be 3 levels.
Easier means bigger target area and wider ""movement direction alley"" for perfect punches and also a little less force/speed requirements. Still better would be sliders to adjust this like in some other fitness games, with 5 different settings or so (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4) with respective point multiplication. But that might get too complicated and hard to realize with fair point systems.

Also, it would be good to be able to switch the streak feature back to simple hit/miss like before. Even if that is then called super easy or off record. I really liked to get into the flow with the music, sometimes making slightly excessive corresponding movements with my arms and upper body, it felt like dancing. Being one with the music, perfectly tuned to the rhythm. That was a major fun factor with Boxvr but this is not possible at all when you always need to focus on hard punches. You're actually starting to blend the music out, which is a pity. 

Please try this yourself, each of you, FitXR team! Do some very long workouts and always try to get perfect punches. There is hardly any flow left, though upper body workout has vastly improved this way. So please make it an option to switch off hard punches, maybe make it perfect timing instead. 

Though these are all still urgent issues in my book I am willing to give kudos to the team for this ""restart"". Looking at their responses, they haven't been able to upgrade BoxVR anymore to develop the vision that they had and thus had to rebuilt from scratch. The name alone, FitXR, in my view allows for many more additions, maybe we will get completely new, additional training rooms and methods.
And I think somewhere they mentioned more personal training and some other stuff (which will likely come at a price or subscription, though). 

That said, maybe they should allow for refunds to the really angry people, if they can make a special agreement with Mr. Zuckerberg based on all those devastating reviews. But I'm not sure if those reviews will then be updated to reflect that move, maybe some will give an additional star or two, but these reviewers seem to feel really robbed of their favorite workout app for now. 

I for one am now excited for what is to come!"

And I'm a 52-yo woman, so it's not like I'm a pro or anything. I liked being able to choose my environments. This version feels less immersive.

2864,roguetr,"Aug 17, 2020 at 2:31 PM",5,Still a great app!,"I love the update but I certainly look forward to improvements. The new streak mechanic is what was needed, pushing you to hit those targets to obtain it rather than flailing in a hit for the sake of the streak. This also makes the new multiplayer mechanic much more competitive and turns a good workout into something you'll be feeling for days.

My only real complaints would be that after a 700 odd hit streak the bright flashing of colours on a dark background can wear on the eyes. I think this needs to be toned back a bit, not the effects but the brightness of them. The menu system and tracking your activities doesn't seem as intuitive but I really haven't spent a lot of time with it yet so it's more of a first impression/observation.

Overall though I'm really pleased and look forward to what else gets added.

2865,JamieTGS,"Aug 13, 2020 at 12:39 AM",5,Incredible,"Amazing fitness trainer for upper body. A 15 minute workout is devastating and I love it. Having other people in a class with you is so motivating. The vocals are not as good as I'd like - vocal triggers on key milestones like 25 hit or 50 can get annoying rather than motivating, hearing ""great speed"" or something like ""you're doing great"" after you've missed as punch is very annoying too.
Frequently hits don't register which is highly frustrating but all in all this is by far the best workout app on Oculus Quest. I'd suggest getting a rubber face guard as you will get very sweaty.
Each class is set to music and sees you perform ducking, upper cuts, jabs or swings with your arms, it's as simple as that. A live leaderboard of the class will have you really pushing yourself.
I hooked up the YUR calories tracker app in the Oculus and must say it registers far lower than the calories FitXR tells me I've burned off - I think FitXR might be a little on the generous side in this regard as my tracker watch also comes no way near what FitXR suggests I hit per workout.

2868,Dan,"Aug 3, 2020 at 11:49 PM",5,This is the best fitness vr game,As a workout with a couple of wrist weights this is very good . However I  would suggest to spice the game up is to have a large target in the game where it takes more than one punch to destroy . Just to give the game some variety kind of like an end of level boss . Also certain classes freeze which is really really annoying please fix the issue or at least tell me if I can do anything to resolve it . To be clear I like this app but I feel the developers have got comfortable and need to take a more disruptive stance .And please fix the freeze issue on certain songs . I set up my own workout and that now freezes too . Please sort it thanks . Update 3rd of August 2020  game has been given a facelift and I really like what they‚Äôve done . Yes you have some issues with the leaderboard  and the contact alignment needs tweeking but credit where credit is due this could easily have been a payed upgrade so thank you for giving it to us for free . And yes I absolutely love it
2869,Colin,"Aug 3, 2020 at 6:25 PM",5,wow. FitXR much better than boxVr,I've been using boxVR since it came out on the quest and bought all the DLC packs. It gave a good workout but never felt as hard a session as going to the gym. I've just upgraded to fitXr and done a 30 minute session. while there are a few teething issues this gave me a much better workout - I don't think I've sweated so much on a VR game before. The main issue is that the multiplayer opponents scores don't update after the first song but hopefully that will be sorted with an update. Just need the ability to use your own music and perhaps a few more backgrounds and this will be unbeatable. Brilliant update.
2870,Tautas,"Aug 3, 2020 at 10:33 AM",5,"Liked change from BoxVR to FitXR, but...","Using Oculus quest. Liked the app change. Like multiplayer option of 6 players. I pretty much understand that most times there are no real players, but bots and it is ok - it still inspires to keep going. However, than you choose  the class - all six 'players' do boxing, but than song during class changes - you always always left only the one still doing boxing. Developers should make bots hit till class end, not till first song end. Also I think app achievements disapeared. Also I think calories counting is messed very much  - as I 'burn' way too much kcal during classes."
2871,MCage,"Aug 8, 2020 at 6:47 PM",2,Such a shame,"Since the conversion from BoxVR to Fit XR the workouts are so lame.
Intermediate and intense workouts are a joke.  They are so slow in tempo and variation that you might think the limited progressing power of the Quest dictates the intensity in favor of pretty graphics.

Dislike the fact you say it is multi-player but we are boxing against ghosts who don't last beyond the first song. At least make them go through the whole song if you aren't going to let us box with friends anymore. I would like to box against myself.
More dislikes: no playing with friends. No leader boards, no seeing what your previous score was on a class, no way to see if you have done a class previously without clicking on each class. How can we measure our improvement or lack there of without these things. This is supposed to be a fitness app I thought, which should include ways to be motivated. 
This should never have been released like this, I am very disappointed."

2876,Jasiri,"Jul 31, 2020 at 6:19 PM",2,Worst update,The new update from BoxVr to FitVr may have prettier graphics but it takes away so many features. A main feature taken away was the custom playlist. I'm sorry but the music selection of this game is mediocre for boxing workouts and the only reason why I continued to use BoxVr was because I could make high intensity custom playlists of music that I enjoy and can workout to. I never enjoyed the classes because they weren't challenging enough and did not consistently play music I like. Bring back the custom playlist feature and then I'll comeback to FitVr. (Also allow us to purchase an add on that uploads mp3 files to be converted to custom tracks. You made it possible on the pc (and I have a suspicion that you're going to patch that out) so it should be possible on the oculus quest)
2877,Joy,"Aug 18, 2020 at 5:46 PM",2,Still a good work out but frustrating,"I loved Box VR, one of the most challenging things was seeing how high I could get my hit streak.

All this does is make me discouraged and not want to play any more.  I do like a lot of the upgrades that were done but watching my hit streak reset constantly when I am dead on target is off putting"

In this new update you must punch the incoming orbs fast and hard enough to turn them into halos of light. If you do not hit the incoming orbs hard enough you will see a splatter of sparks (like a rocket engine failer I suppose)

This new system forces you to work to your maximum and allows the app to calculate more accurately the amount of calories you have just burnt.

The callories are no longer displayed in real time but rather at the end of your workout. 

There are many more feachers which I will come back and update in this review!

I'm so taken by this amazing app and so grateful for the hard work and effort the developers have put into this app and update, that I purchased the new dlc that is now on offer with this new update. I have previously purchased the two other dlc packs, so you can call me a fan of Box VR...

2881,Aaron Howe,"Aug 1, 2020 at 2:03 PM",5,Update from Box VR to Fit XR,"I've come back to re-review since the latest update is so big that it might as well be a new game.

I was worried at first that the new layout with a single ""gym"" would be distracting having gotten used to having three environments to choose from but it's not so bad, in fact it helped me focus and having the stats in front is actually better.

The music tracks are the same as they were, I'm not sure whether they actually added more or just juggled them but it feels like there is more choice - possibly because it's now possible to filter to a genre and to see before you start which type of music is in a workout.

It's nice to hear the instructor encouragement but at the moment it feels disconnected from the action. I'm not sure if it was recorded that way or whether I need to tweak my settings but it feels as if the voice is coming over a tannoy rather than being ""in the room"".

In future updates I probably would appreciate a choice of environments and the return of boxing gloves (I'd pay for that as DLC). My expectation though is to see Fit XR release some hardware components - a sweatproof attachment like the ones VR Cover sell (but without import costs), glove attachments for the controllers or even hand tracking now it's available."
2882,atc48uk,"Aug 2, 2020 at 12:47 PM",2,Disappointed,"BoxVr was my go to exercise routine, averaging a few hours daily during lockdown. Being my first experience on VR I was surprised at being instantly addicted.. Then I switch the Quest on for my morning exercise to find  it gone and replaced with a completely different experience... I so want to enjoy this in the same way I did Box but I don't..  First off, what has happened to the uppercut? Something in the way they work has changed as I've gone from barely missing one in Box to missing more than I'm hitting!!! 

Please consider allowing us the option of using the original Box, that is the game I paid money for, as this at present seems like a completely different experience, unfortunately one that isn't as good as the original.."
2883,Glenn,"Aug 11, 2020 at 12:37 AM",3,Please bring back the boxing gym,I agree. I preferred the boxing gym feel to BoxVR. The techno environment is okay occasionally but I hate having it all the time. Please bring back the gym option! A high tech game does not always need to make you feel like you're in space.
2884,Jeff Spencer,"Aug 26, 2020 at 5:58 AM",3,Improved and yet so frustrating,"UPDATE August 25 2020 - elevated from two stars, to three stars. a recent update has sorted the overall list of classes by length. I'll add to this if I notice more improvements. Keep it up guys!

UPDATE August 18 2020 - elevated from one star, to two stars. The ability to save favorites brings my rating back up a notch. I'll be fair and will update my review as the product continues to return to greatness.

UPDATE August 9 2020 - Dropping another star after losing the 6-8 classes I had added to Favorites which are now erased. Am attempt to save a new favorite had the same result. Saved, but was gone upon re-launch of the app. Adding to the issue is the inability to add a class to favorites directly, without having to run through and complete the class before being presented with the option to add as a favorite.

I suggest leveraging a pool of beta testers before publishing buggy updates! Right now this is, at best, a beta release, and beta testers are usually volunteers ...not paying customers!

The recently upgraded FitXR (formerly BoxVR which I rated 5 stars) has much improved graphical interface, but I'm revising my review for this new version, and dropping my resting down to two stars.

Here is why.

I love the added information provided as well as the vastly improved location (visible without needing to glance to the side of take your vision off of the oncoming targets).

Unfortunately that is where my love turns to frustration.

The lists of classes has no thought to organisation. There is no progression of classes by length. The only way to narrow down by length is to apply a filter, except the filters are not labeled with the range of time but rather ""short"", ""medium"", and ""long"". A range of times would be that here. Is a 12 or 14 minute workout in with short, or medium? ...and why not sort them all out by length? The view of all classes are scattered with no logic that I have determined.

I missed the announcement where all of my stats from BoxVR would not be migrated to this new app.

There is no longer the ability to create a workout using a custom song list.

Let's talk multiplayer. While it is cool to see my class get populated with up to six additional contestants, there is a question as to if these are live people, playing along in real time. I and many others have noticed that they all stop participating after a few minutes. This takes my name on the board from 3rd place, magically to 1st place! A victory over simulated or pre-recorded contestants is a hollow victory. One of my friends looked over and saw that she was boxing along side of her own user ID!

We miss the ability to start multiplayer games, and invite our friends to join us. Gone is the option for this.

Now on to how Peak hits are counted. This is my major point of contention. I can get every oncoming target, but if I don't strike it as a power hit (with the ring) it doesn't count and resets the peak hit counter? Why the change to this?

Why not count a player's ability to hit the targets, and reset when one is missed. Let power hits count toward faster advancement to higher levels!

How about favorites? I see that there is a place for them, but how/where can favorites be added?

Here is a recap / wishlist;
I love the redesign, but it falls short in other areas.

On the streak count let it count every 'strike' and reset it back to zero on misses.

Let the 'power strikes' be bonus hits that either accelerate ascending levels, or count toward advancing to higher levels.

Default sort classes no matter the filter applied should be by length of the class.

An indicator on the thumbnail of each class indicating of it has been played, and most recent score would also be welcome.

Finally, ditch the bots. If you aren't competing against living people in real-time, any victories are hollow victories.


~ Reviewed for the previous 5 star version ~

So fun that I forget that I'm exercising!

I am working to get Box VR into my regular morning routine, and working my way up in both speed and duration.

This game will get your body moving, your heart pumping, and get you sweaty!

Your muscles will 'feel' this!

Pricy, but totally worth it! No subscription required however add-on workout packs are made available for a low cost."
2885,RHH,"Aug 25, 2020 at 11:23 PM",3,Great workout: Not so great expereince,"As a workout this is amazing, but as others have said.  I miss the flexibility and song choice from BoxVR and the other customization's.  I get extremely frustrated with the new streak functionality in fitXR.  I would rather go back to the BoxVR format where as long as you make accurate contact with the obstacles and or avoid the barriers you shouldn't lose your streak progress.  Something is also off with the scoring as it will show as a certain rank and then as you progress other users popup with higher scores.  It would be nice if the ranking was more accurate so if I'm at rank 5 and bypass the next ranked player I shouldn't still be at the same rank."

2889,Dave,"Aug 10, 2020 at 10:26 AM",2,Dull and boring,"TLDR:Dull and boring, get beatsabre instead.

Im sorry to say this,  but BoxVR is a very slow, dull & boring experience.

Ive only heard positive things about it, so when it came up in the ""Stay active at home"" bundle I jumped at the chance. However,  it simply is not engaging or fun. 

On the positive side it allows you to set goals for your self, create additional profiles for you're friends or families, and record your workout.

But..it just feel so static! 
You stand in one place, duck a few times and ""punch"" slow moving balls to the most uninspiring music i have ever had the misfortunes to hear. 

You absolutely have to compare it to Beat Sabre as it's so similar in concept, but it falls short on all accounts.  I know you don't through punchs in BeatSabre and its all flippy twisty wrist movements, but it's a more enjoyable experience all around. Better concept, gets you much more active and provides much better quality tunes that really provide a much better work out.

I guess its more of a dance game and that will no doubt put butch macho types off, which is a real shame. 

From a technical aspect I was having a real problems getting game to actually start! I pick my workout, pick my environment from the 3 available (a gym hall (in day time or night time colours) and a hyper real vr type landscape)....and am presented with a black infinite loading screen. 25% the game loads otherwise i have to exit and start again. 

If you have that game,  don't bother with this one. 
If you're torn between the two,  id have to say get that. 

Giving it 2 start for the front end management aspect, but the main guts of the experience is sorely lacking.

I intend to request a refund on BoxVR after writing this but will then also lose the racket ball game RacketNx (which is simpler,  but a much better experience) which is a real shame. 

Very disappointing."

Pros.... i like that they got rid of the boxing gloves and replaced them with hands and tape. Looks better when throwing punches. 

The music is fun and works perfectly with the game play. 


My only con.... i feel like the squats are too low. I‚Äôm 6 foot tall and i have to get really low to get past them. It keeps breaking my streaks lol. Maybe i‚Äôm missing something with a height adjustment in the game.

There's less environments, you can't multiplayer with a friend of your choosing, the workouts are more limiting, I can't create a custom playlist or just play one song and I don't like that if you don't punch hard enough it just seems like a wasted effort.

Rarely has an update so completely changed the look and feel of a game, like Windows xp to Windows 95, this builds on the same concept and massively improves in everyway.

Same great gameplay, but now visually impressive, and a real time leader board to make your want to hit harder and longer.

Inconsistent tracking: they've always blamed this on the VR headset but somehow other apps are able to do it properly!

Game pause: wanna grab a quick sip in-between your songs? Well, good luck not losing the streak! Game doesn't care that you've paused, it'll randomly decide to start up.

30+ minutes games: I've never been able to play games longer than 30 minutes, it always crashes 70-80% through. 

No new songs: they'll happily charge you for new content (which at this point is only 2) but will never reward early supporters with free new content.

Long term record keeping: not sure this is entirely BoxVR's fault here but I have lost my total exercise time/calories burned twice. I've spent upwards of 50 hours in this game but my total shows 11 hours now.


The whole point of this app and many other exercise VR apps is to gamify working out. If it fails at gamifying and motivating the user with points and good record keeping, it fails as an exercise app."

*working out on locations like supernatural could be a option.

I stopped using box vr because I was getting bored and there wasn‚Äôt enough drawing me back into it. Supernatural was nice because it had a strong focus on fitness and I didn‚Äôt have to think too much about what exercise routine I was going to do. I‚Äôd just pick whatever the daily one was. The social aspects of the game made it a little more addictive and compelling to come back on a regular basis. However, I‚Äôm starting to get bored of the swinging bats motion. 

I tried out FitXR and it feels like it took the best features from super natural, and kept the boxing motions (which I prefer). 

The ability to be in a ‚Äúclass‚Äù with others is a really nice touch. 

I just hope that other modes of play eventually get introchded, as I can see the gameplay loop of only boxing getting boring."

However I totally understand those 1 star reviews for suddenly require a registration. This should be fixed ASAP. Not a good move at all and it really should not weigh down on this game!

One thing I dearly miss is the endless mode. Now where hitting is far less glitchy I really would like to give it a go.

And one feature request. Add a ""mean"" marker of the current session to the power bar, so you can see if your current punches are above or below your current mean."
2913,BadFrage,"Aug 4, 2020 at 11:10 AM",5,Strange but good,"This update feels more like a sequel than an update. That said, I was getting a little bored of the old BoxVR and this new update (for free) has refreshed my interest. Just finished a workout and was absolutely knackered so I think competing scores is a good motivator. There are definitely some things that need ironing out but for me personally I see a lot more longevity in this version than the old.

I do understand why people who loved the old version are upset so maybe a ‚Äúclassic mode‚Äù would be a good thing to include. All in all though I‚Äôm happy saying goodbye to boxVR and hello to fitVr, at least while I still have the strength to lift my arms.... I need a lie down now!"
2914,Daniel Mendek,"Aug 4, 2020 at 11:36 PM",5,Changes make it a new game!,"I've own BOXVR and used it a lot for the first month. Currently I haven't been working out for about a month or two, I was hot and heavy then it kinda got dull and I had performance issues etc that took the crap out and I was getting irritated with the headset dropping, so lets say I've not done it with the BOXVR game in a while.

Well I read on reddit that they changed the name to FitXR or something and I open it up it's a whole new ""game"". Multiplayer classes, redesigned ui, more metrics and it saves information like high scores now (a lot of the complaints of the older BOXVR game) and 10 minutes again made me sweat. And the cool part? I freaking out did the rest of the ""class"" :)

 Needless to say I liked it before now it's a new love the only thing that wasn't changed is the game play, still based on punches, upper cuts side jabs and squats but everything else changed, music, UI in session and out."

Playing BoxVR was kind of ""ho hum"" for me. I was getting bored after just a few days, to be honest.

But what you did to transform it into FitXR is phenomenal! I kept wanting to play and compete with others, since it was all live! Also, hand tracking finally works. Everything is so much better. Thank you for the brilliant update! I highly recommend this game!"

The upgrade to FitXR has a more polished look and feel, but they removed features. You used to be able to have different locations to do your workouts in. Now all you have is a gym.

2920,flip.feral,"Oct 2, 2020 at 9:49 PM",3,Almost perfect,"Have played it for few times and pluses are many and few minuses too
Pluses: 
#Can input weight
#Very wide range of music, so workout is dynamic
#Game style build and point system makes this good fun
#After good workout can feel a bit of muscle burning
#As workouts are more fun - hour feels not so long

Minuses
#If I can put in weight, but can not my height, to check after some time my progress
#some music generates targets too close and it is risk to smash my controllers (like left hook, than right, than upper cut, than left hook again) they all comes with very small interval
#Can not make my playlist of favorite workouts, that they would be with 30 second brakes for 3minute ones or 1 minute brake for 10minute ones
#Some times controllers lack tracking and they register punches ar weak or miss and some missed
#I would love to see some side stepping excersise with punches to maximise my workout

All in all very good game and good fun, love to help to develop this more to get better workout.


P.S. some time has passed... Getting very annoyed with this game. Many times controllers in game looses tracking, marks does not count, odd misses when I'm 100% sure I hit the target, lags, etc"

I quickly lost weight playing this each night and changing some eating habits. Saw big differences in few weeks. I love the music, the boxing, how it brought out my competitive side. I sweat so much after each workout. I know that thrill of the night is even more intense but no way as fun as this game. 

Best advice for me to give is to punch as hard as you can with each orb. People complain that it‚Äôs not intense enough but it is if you push yourself. (I‚Äôve seen videos of people just tapping the orbs as they come- won‚Äôt do anything for you!) The new update to fit xr rewards you for picking fast and hard. Love it! I also love the instructors encouragement along the way through the work out. Nice addition. 

Can‚Äôt speak highly enough for this game. Devs have done a great job, looks great and easy to grasp. Think the multiplayer needs a little tweak since update, they are aware of this as I messaged them to give the feedback. They hope to sort it in the next patch.  being able to easily see leaderboard against friends would be great.

I‚Äôve lost ¬£15 and I‚Äôm pretty sure I won‚Äôt see that again. Sure, the new game is good but I miss my training regime and what I paid good money for. I will not be making anymore in app purchases just in case now."
2928,Luckylion,"Aug 18, 2020 at 9:42 PM",3,Progress?,"I‚Äôm all for progress and I think there has been a little here. However, the things that were taken away really outweigh that progress in my view. It‚Äôs no longer the game I bought here and on psvr. 

Measuring the power of punches is good, the tracking sometimes lets that down. I‚Äôm not really interested in the multiplayer aspect that is now included in the sense of score comparisons. One environment, with no choice to go back to the studios. That‚Äôs one of the bigger mistakes imv.

It now feels more like a computer game than the exercise app it originally was. I‚Äôll still use it, but slightly more reluctantly and will look around my library more often for alternatives. I‚Äôll also think twice about buying software from the studio next time purely on the basis of wholesale changes (most in my view, not needed). Sorry devs.

In short this was a 4.5 star app, near perfect. It‚Äôs now, at best, a 4. It losses a star due to the total overhaul to software people had already purchased. I suspect this reaction from customers must have been expected to some extent, so there must have been a good reason.

In any case, buy it for training. It‚Äôs good. You may have missed the heyday of BoxVR, but you‚Äôll get something out of it."
2929,Choogie,"Sep 3, 2020 at 4:17 AM",3,Not a good standalone fitness strategy,"Yes, it does give a cardio workout with a few caveats... Repeated deep squats done in a leading leg  ""fighting stance""  is incorrect form and will exacerbate knee problems. The longer sessions that go squat crazy will tell on older knees. Another thing is the emphasis on ""power"" in the punches. You are performing an open chain ballistic movement forcefully and repeatedly, if you have shoulder impingements you'll soon find out. To build ""power"" get a heavy bag. I'm not saying don't do this because it is fun, but do not limit exercise to just doing this or think it's turning you into a formidable boxer."

Update:- after trying the new update it has opened up the whole game to me having the option now to turn the squats off from every workout is amazing so so happy . Only slight problem I have now is trying to make the upper cut connection from a seated position is very few and far between so lose my streak quite regular but apart from that I‚Äôm very happy with the upgrade looks great !"

BOX VR was one of my go to fitness experiences in VR. I'm really enjoying the improvements made to it now its called FIT XR."
2936,Arturo Molina,"Apr 18, 2020 at 7:36 PM",4,Awesome! But might I suggest...,"The game does one thing EXTREMELY well. It makes working out fun! My wife and I do not like working out. It always feels like a chore. I actually get excited about playing this and easily burn 400+ calories in 30 minutes. It provides tons of positive feedback with the hit sounds, haptic feedback, scores, etc. I had so much sweat today that I was slipping on the floor because of my sweat (playing barefoot, lol). The different types of punches add a nice variety and doing it all to the beat of a song makes it so much easier and enjoyable. Once you get the hang of it, you can go on streaks of 300+ hits with ease, just following the beat.

That being said, I have several suggestions that can make this game an easy 5 stars...

1) Please add the ability to hop/jump in place consecutively. This could mimic jumping jacks or even the hopping that boxers do in the ring. All you have to do is add little bumps that appear on the ground that you need to hop over as they pass. By monitoring the movement of the headset up and down, the quest should be capable of perceiving the jumps. Additionally, you could add bars that you must hit with your head in between squats to ensure you are rising in between, rather than just staying down. Both of these would add a whole new dynamic to the game and way more potential calories burned.

2) Add side steps while you‚Äôre at it. Boxing consists of a lot of shuffling in the ring, so why not add this to the game? Beat saber does this with vertical walls that force you to shuffle left and right, not just dodge. This would be HUGE!

3) Why not add a couple of beautiful dojo‚Äôs. Perhaps one on the edge of a mountain or by the ocean. This could transform the experience completely!

4) Please please please change the sound effect that occurs after getting 50 in a row. It sounds almost identical to the sound that occurs when you miss. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Easy fix for an otherwise confusing occurrence. I‚Äôm always thinking I‚Äôm missing punches rather than completing a streak. 

5) You have to have workouts that indicate difficulty level, type (focused punching, squatting, etc.), and maybe speed. This would make choosing a lot easier.

6) Lastly, I plan on adding arm weights to my workouts in the near future, but I would LOVE to see an option that you can indicate extra weights so that the burned calories accommodate for this change.

Add these things and I guarantee you will have more people raving about this game!!"
2937,Nathan,"Aug 8, 2020 at 7:21 PM",5,New version is fantastic!,"Great game! Very comfortable; as someone who gets nauseous in other games easily, I have no problems in FitXR. The new system encourages better form and a harder workout! I love this update!"
2938,Í≤¨Ï£º,"Aug 1, 2020 at 5:23 PM",5,I love it after the update,"There‚Äôs a lot of negative comments about the upgrade, but personally I love it. It pushes me to make much harder punches then BoxVR, which leads to a better workout. I also like the new environment more. The previous ones were too big place for me, and I felt really alone in that place almost scared me a bit. 

My only problem is that multiplayer mode seems to break after first round in every session. After one round, other players suddenly stops moving, and they are all in still position, and their scores are not changing at all. So I always end up being the highest score, which is totally wrong. (Because I suck)

If this gets fixed, it would be my best workout game in quest."
2939,postpunk,"Aug 1, 2020 at 11:55 PM",5,FitXR delivers on my BoxVR wish list,"I've always enjoyed BoxVR, but I found the HUD boring and I didn't think the various beeps and chimes were motivating at all. The new sense of live competition (even if it's probably at least partially faked), plus the real-time punch speed metrics, really lit a fire under me to get me to put in more effort.

I also love you can turn squats on/off for each workout, rather than being forced to pick between squat and no-squat workouts and limiting yourself to only a subset of the total workouts available.

Bottom line: my workouts are way more fun and effective now. I would buy this game again without hesitation."
2940,Rick,"Aug 2, 2020 at 4:19 AM",5,Has become my core workout,"This is a great app, both fun and exerting!  After a warmup focusing on Beatsaber, and some interval training with Thrill of the Fight, I cool down with Pistol Whip and head here.  The tutorial was clear and startup was simple. My favorite option is to pick your own music playlist from several genres, making my own custom workouts.  My five workouts are Rock based, but there‚Äôs something for everyone.  Of course there are many predesigned workouts offered with all the genres represented.  I also like the custom option because you choose how vigorously you want to move. As a guy I didn‚Äôt like the default glove colors, and saw that I could change them in settings.  As the title says it has become the core of my workouts and makes motivation easy to get high quality cardio exercise with the Quest.
UPDATE:  The above was for Box VR.  Liking it as much as I did I was ready to be disappointed when Fit VR replaced it. It‚Äôs even better!   I can choose a music genre among the available workouts, along with other choices.   And speed now counts!   Before, it could have lead to not so good boxing habits because not missing counted more than power, but not now.  To the developers:  thanks, you made a great app superb!"
2941,Ragnar,"Aug 2, 2020 at 1:43 AM",5,Challenging and Fun despite the Switch,"I‚Äôve been doing BoxVR for 7 months and enjoyed it but wished it was more challenging. I‚Äôd finally found a way to select all Hard workouts using the playlists but even those weren‚Äôt great. I still enjoyed it but wished there was a way to choose the intensity of the workout from amongst the preset workouts. I mean I‚Äôd have 3000+ hit streaks and didn‚Äôt feel I was working that hard. I mean it was like anyone regardless of how hard they tried could do great, the whole ‚Äúmedal for participating‚Äù concept. And the glitches and missed hits got frustrating at times. So it wasn‚Äôt a perfect game but good enough. 

This new game that replaced BoxVR is quite different though it‚Äôs still a boxing simulation. But it‚Äôs more challenging. The streaks only occur when you hit the objects with stronger force (I played the hard level, not sure if the same applies to the other levels) . So if you slack off no streak, and it spurs my competitive spirit more to hit harder to build the streak. I‚Äôve never burned as many calories in a BoxVR session as I did on FitVR today. 

So don‚Äôt let the naysayers turn you away, this is different than BoxVR but great and as long as I get back the content I paid for I‚Äôll be sticking to this game. Otherwise they better give me my $20 back."

It‚Äôs a shame that FitXR shares the same rating score as BoxVR or else I‚Äôm sure it would score a lot higher. BoxVR had a few tracking issues which would really throw off my timing but that has been fixed! No more issues. Also, the new team training feature is amazing. The leaderboard really pushes me to work so much harder, I love to win first place and to show off my combo rating to the rest of the team. After playing this game for 30 minutes or so I‚Äôm absolutely soaked with sweat and muscles all throughout my body are super pumped. 

Shadow boxing is an incredible workout with so many benefits, look it up. Shadow boxing on its own, however, can feel awkward and uncomfortable for non-boxers. This fixes that problem, now anyone can feel cool and have fun shadow boxing and get super fit."
2945,LeeDicious,"Aug 14, 2020 at 3:28 AM",4,"Great app, lots of fun.","The update to fit vr is pretty great over all. However there are a few small things. I have a bad knee so sometimes I turn off crouch, but when I turn it back on the game seems to think I am no longer 6ft tall and rather 4ft, ducking is pretty hard when you have to get so low you could walk on all 4's. A reboot of the app resolves this issue but a patch would be better. 

Please make pause work. I'm sweating more than a full pint glass on a hot summers day, I need to wipe my brow. I hit pause, then after about 20 seconds the workout starts even though the pause menu is still up?...

Lastly the menu, or rather the select workout. Make it so you can pick total workout time in ascending or descending order. The times are all over the bloody place. And it would be nice if I could just pick workouts from a specific theme pack I down loaded. If I am somehow missing how to do either of these things I apologise. 

All that aside, huge improvement from box vr. Not having to calibrate or set glove location is amazing. The objects being dodged seem to be represented better. The power, and power hit combo is amazing! It really make you go harder, gotta crush that streak counter! The addition of  in workout levels is also great as now it's even more of a challenge to adapt and grow.

2950,Emmabee,"Aug 1, 2020 at 6:16 AM",5,A Fantastic Update to BoxVR,"This is a smart and fantastically executed update to a program that was beginning to feel a bit dated if still fun. 

The Multi-player format is the best i have ever seen in a Vr game.  Joining a multi player game is quick easy and it's so much fun to see the little avatars next to me punching away and competing on the scoreboard in front of us.  I will probably always play in multi player mode now.  It's not at all intimidating its just adds motivation to do better.  I love how the players next to you are in a semi circle so you can see all of the figures and their hands and names. 

I like the new targets.  they are sleek and fit in perfectly with the whole game esthetic which is so smooth.  I love the new ...not sure what to call it?  power punch indicator?  the circle puff?  What ever it is it is fun to see and present but not obstructive.  It's great, really nice to try for more.

Regarding the new UI.  All of the information i need to see is easy to pick out even in the midst of a game and all of the menus are uniformly clear and concise and beautiful to boot.  In the old BoxVR some of the menus in game were hard to see and somehow obstructive at the same time?  An odd unfortunate accomplishment.  But no more.  Now they are perfect.

The levels and stars thing.  I don't know where this is going but i love it and am excited to see how it progresses.  I am fervently hoping it unlocks environments and awards for the home environment or something. 

Thank you for allowing us to turn off squats.   That is a major improvement for those of us with sometimes sensitive backs.

Thank you for taking the time to polish up BoxVR and set it up for growth in the future.   I will enjoy playing this often, leveling up, not sure why yet, and earning stars."

2953,shaneosan,"Aug 1, 2020 at 2:39 AM",5,New Update Rocks!,"I absolutely love the new update, especially being able to add ‚Äúfavourites‚Äù and select the genre of music for the workout.

I love the new effects when hitting which is really pushing me to give it my all through the whole class.

Targets are easier to read, the interface is way more fluid and user friendly. I love the hand animation way more than the gloves... 

I‚Äôve always had an issue with the diagonal lunge... sometimes it registers as a hit when there‚Äôs no way it was. Also in this new edition, I seem to break my streak somehow even though I hit the target... but maybe that‚Äôs on me. Either way, I can live with that... and seeing as how I don‚Äôt care about adding my own music (though that would be cool) I am quite happy to give this 5 stars ... and I haven‚Äôt even explored the other new features. 

Well done."
2954,KillOhm,"Aug 1, 2020 at 6:06 AM",5,New FitXR,"I considered the old BoxVR to be a decent light workout that was easy to keep up due to the decent integration with its varied music.

The new FitXR is totally different. It feels like you're in a smaller space which makes the barriers a bit more challenging (good). They've also modified the scoring system for the better, with strike speed playing an important part. This really increases workout intensity for me. Also it seems more forgiving of misses but has streaks of fast hits.

I think these changes have improved it greatly and I bought their high intensity pack as I can see myself using it more as a fitness aid.

The one thing i wish it had was workouts that require greater foot movement and stretching by having a wider track with the targets coming to the sides, higher, and lower. Also having targets swapping sides would encourage wide crosses for flexibility. Perhaps even a head butt mode with you having to jump/duck/lean to hit head targets (youd need an onscreen indicator of head position for that to work though)."
2955,SurrealSculptor65,"Aug 1, 2020 at 3:23 AM",5,awesome for all levels,"i've been reading a lot of these reviews, and they all have merit.  I know some of the people want something more challenging than this, set at a 45 minute high intensity level?   those guys must be ex Marines or Green Berets! LOL!  and I did like the previous version, the VR box. But this to me, is pretty cool. I like it better.  for beginner and intermediate, this is awesome!  i'll tell you what though, if you want a lot more challenge, do it I did. Go on Amazon, buy these 1.5 pound ea. exercise gloves, and try it with those!  The easiness factor drops in waves!  you can put the weighted gloves on your wrists, and hold the controllers easily.  thanks again, great exercise app!"
2956,Adam,"Aug 1, 2020 at 1:31 AM",3,Forced to register but good exercise,"After the recent update you are forced to register with an e-mail address and progress is deleted. Such a lazy way to design an upgrade it reminds me of contractors. I'm in software development for over a decade and can tell that this was avoidable, both of them. Bumping off a couple stars for that, hoping they'll learn.

Otherwise the app is great for workout, although can get boring after a while. If you filter on length and type of exercise the selection is not that wide, eg. I like to do 10-15 minutes and with something that also works for legs. They'll tell you to buy more content though so that's somewhat warranted...

The exercises can get really intense but mostly focus on upper body. There are crouches and sidesteps, but mostly you punch the air in various ways and stabilize yourself after, so it does not do much for lower body. I don't know how you would achieve a good lower body workout in VR, but this app doesn't. Still, good cardio, can even get intensive, nice graphics, not bad selection of music, so yeah, go for it if that's what you want."

2960,Katie,"Aug 12, 2020 at 2:51 AM",4,I miss the game I actually paid for....,"******Update - A week and an app update in, I‚Äôm getting over my initial disappointment with the ‚Äúswitch‚Äù to FitXR.  A few cons: The calorie counter in not visible during the exercise and even when visible I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôs calculated and I miss having multiple scenes for the exercise. 

That being said - this new version has grown on me and I‚Äôm still very happy with the workout I get from this app*******



I was initially thrilled to see there was an update to BoxVr. I use it daily as part of my workout routine and even though it was relatively simple from a graphics standpoint, it was easy to use, had good variety in workouts and songs and overall a great fitness app for the Quest. I was hoping an update would bring things such as additional locations, or ability to customize the workout a bit more. Instead, it was a complete overhaul of the game, making BoxVr almost unrecognizable. I was ok with this until starting the workout...I couldn‚Äôt get a streak above single digits. The ducks/dodges are almost impossible (I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù) and the hooks/uppercuts response must be off bc I hit them the same
Way I do DAILY in BoxVr but they don‚Äôt register and I‚Äôm back down to 0 which is frustrating. There isn‚Äôt an option to calibrate height so this will probably continue to be a point of frustration. I just wish this update had been a blend of what existed with some new exciting features. This feels like a bait and switch and is not what I paid for."

I even tried to uninstall the whole game, but after I reinstalled it, all my old accounts that I couldn‚Äôt edit showed up again. Really frustrating.

2967,EvilJorel,"Aug 14, 2020 at 6:43 AM",3,"Fun, but update lost setting features","I agree with others that it's latest move was in the wrong direction. It's a huge bummer that this is no longer my favorite Fitness game . 

Few example reasons:

1.  There is no longer a way to adjust the virtual hand positions to match your real-world grip on the controllers in the settings area.  This causes virtual hands to be positioned at awkward angles.   Seems like a small detail, however the game now feels less accurate at tracking hits. (Also less immersive)

2. This is the first Oculus game that required me to give an email to play... That seems like cheap data grab move I would expect from a ""free-to-play"" game, that feels distasteful in this paid content. Also it looks like the addresses are being leaked/displayed to other players (lacking only the domain) during virtual group sessions....yikes. 

3. No longer having a variety in Virtual locations to choose from and overall less customization options... why?! 


DEVS: I really hope effort is put in to address recent feedback from myself & other users.    Or maybe just allow the toggling of a ""retro mode"" to restore the functionality/code originally purchased to those who desire it.  One way or another, please give me my awesome game back! :)"
2968,maybeageek,"Aug 4, 2020 at 2:06 PM",3,"BoxVR was great, FitXR not so much","Hi,
I loved the feeling of the old gyms. It teleported me right into the Rocky movies and the 90s boxing glory.
The new version does nothing of that and I would not have bought it if it looked this from the beginning.

All in all, BoxVR was the App I wanted and bought over all the other fitness apps. FitXR feels strange, buggy, and wouldn't even be considered if I'd search for a workout App now.

Additionally, although the ""Old"" workouts are still there, all my times and streaks are gone. It is as if I started new :-(

EDIT: Removed my complaint about the streak counter and added a *. The streak counter now just works differently, in that it only counts streaks of explosive hits. That is different than before."

2977,Queherain,"Aug 23, 2020 at 7:46 PM",4,A bunch of weaknesses,"I really loved BoxVR and gave 5 Stars, sadly this new Version is a downgrade for now. 

As many had said, the lack of real multiplayer,different environments and custom playlists is ugly.
The Day and Night from BOXVR scenery was very nice.

 I do like the fresher look (like Supernatural, I guess) but if you play long workouts with longer strains it's really hard to see some balls because of all that huge particle effects. Especially the diagonally below balls are very strange and very difficult to hit 'hard'.

There is now a change from correctly hitting to hard hitting I guess but it's very frustrating if you hit a ball with big explosions effects and light ring and get zero strain because you did not do the perfect hard hitting - which is sometimes impossible because of rapid changes of movements. 
There could be an choosing option between old and new system.

In the custom menue I did not find any logout button.



Edit 23-08-20
After the update the play flow is much better, it is really fun again !

I like the random multiplayer-function, but it would be nice to invite my real friends. In the course of the necessary FB-registration it makes no sense if you cannot specifically invite real friends to the experiences.

And a big whish is the re-install of custom experiences from the existing music."

I'm not liking all those glove blocks that come towards you, total waste of time, would prefer more shapes thrown at me. The shapes need to come at you faster and longer. Did try few different ones but just didn't keep me coming back that much. Probaly go back to beat saber for abit unless they actually make these workouts what they say they are - INTENSE!"
2979,Dolenz,"Aug 2, 2020 at 10:31 PM",3,BoxVR fan disappointed in FitXR,"It is impossible for fans of BoxVr not to rate this in comparison to the original app which it replaced. There is some good an some bad and unfortunately the bad outweighs the good. I have been a BoxVR user for a very long time since early in the Rift CV1 days. 

The Good

* The ability to favorite a workout
* Better Filter options for workouts
* The ability to remove squats from a workout. 
* Tracking of your best scores by workout
* New menu structure and environment looks nice. 

The Bad 

* Seems laggy - I feel like the audible results of my hits are slightly delayed
* Misses - I have had misses (not many) where I wonder how I possibly missed the target.
* Streaks - removing hit streaks in favor of explosive streaks is unwelcome. In fact I kind of hate it. 
* Levels - They are a mystery now. I have no idea how they are computed. I assume a combination of power and streaks? Kind of annoying not to know. 
* Particle Effects - Let me turn them off or tone them down. The explosive hit effect is extremely distracting.
* Custom Workouts - Or should I say the removal of custom workouts. 
* The inability from the workout menu screen to easily see which ones I have already done. Having to click on the workout and see if there are recorded scores is a pain. 
* The Calorie count - It has never been great but computing near 20 calorie a minute burn is outlandish. 

I guess I will give it three stars because at it's core you can still jump in, hit targets and burn some calories but I have to remove a few stars for the negatives introduced with the new version. 

Oh, and you want to earn a 1 star review for the Rift version? Update it and remove my custom workouts with my own music."
2980,Ry,"Aug 2, 2020 at 6:15 PM",2,A downgrade,"The developers have made a right mess of this. 

I give them credit for wanting to revamp the game but surely they know this is a step backwards?

Personally I don't care about the lack of venues. They don't matter to me. I can see why it's angering others

What's matters is the core experience. Stupid particle effects while looking nice cause a hindrance when seeing the flow. 

As a taller person I feel like I'm punching someone about 5ft6. The original box VR had a similar issue (never understood why they didn't allow us to calibrate height) but this is worse. 

I understand they plan on updating this, although I don't have much faith in regular updates in a timely fashion. If possible some options to tinker effects, gloves, height etc to specific needs would go a great way to improving things. 

I wish them well, no developer sets out to make a bad experience. I just hope they take criticism and improve on things. 

Good luck."

2984,RMRZ,"Aug 6, 2020 at 5:02 PM",4,New FitVR is hit & miss,"I've been doing workouts with the predecessor BoxVR and have now done a few with FitVR. 

First off, I do not fully agree with the many reviews here claiming that Fit is totally different from Box and that we should all send in formal complaints. 

It's not ""totally different"". In many ways it's even an improvement, but in some ways it isn't. 

On the Plus side:
- Improved statistics. 
- Filters to select your workout 
- Focus on speed, resulting in far more intense workouts. In Box I could easily do 30 focused minutes, but Fit has me gasping for air within 10. 
- Better multi-player experience. Even though the ""opponents"" are very probably not actually boxing with you at the same time (probably the last 6 that did that workout), it beats the previous experience of having to wait around for minutes to finally have an opponent show up. 

On the Minus side:
- This is a big one. The ""special effects"" of exploding balls with the 'explosive ring' gets in the way of your workout. It obstructs your view. There should be an option to significantly tone it down or remove entirely. (HIGH PRIORITY)
- The streak now only measures ""explosive hits"" instead of all hits. This way I'll never beat my Box records of over 1200 consecutive hits. 
- Some extra sceneries (e.g. Traditional urban gym) would be nice, but I'm guessing those are on the product  roadmap, but not crucial for launch."

There is only one environment now where BoxVR there was 3. So please bring back those 3 environments as options to pick from.

The instructors are voice over is a nice touch to the gameplay so during the sessions it won't feel boring.

Getting a perfect hit is really tough to build up the streak. I don't know if there is suppose to be a correct way of hitting, but so far I find out that if I try to hit really hard, then I will get the perfect hit, however when the crazy combos come, it will be really hard to make a perfect hit especially when the sensors are trying to catch up to the controllers movement.
If there is a correct way to hitting then hitting as hard as you can, then please put out new instructions for players to know how they can get the perfect hit to build up their streaks.

The last thing I really care about is the internet connection is require to play FitXR when BoxVR you can play without an internet connection.
I used to travel and play BoxVR anywhere I like.
However now I have to find a location with an internet connection in my travel to play FitXR.

I like the Power indicator in this new upgrade and not having to mess around with the gloves. However, I am very frustrated with the glitch in the hit streaks. I even would do the Basic courses to see if I was doing something wrong. It registers the points but the streak goes back to zero sometimes continuously. When competing against others it is hard to believe they have a max streak. The favorites button also doesn't seem to work when I try to save a class I like. I miss my daily goals to keep me motivated. I like the change of how to block and it is a great improvement. I was saved by BoxVR as it didn't require Internet and I was in solo quarantine for 14 days due to Covid measures. The place I was in had no internet. It really helped me pass the time away and stay in shape. I am glad the upgrade didn't happen before then. So like mentioned before please bring back a retro option not requiring internet. I live in an Under developed country and I go places where there is no internet connection. I still want to be able to use the App I paid for. Those are my two stars that I took away. 
I do like the layout personally in FitXR, especially the power bar and the competitors on the side. I also like the encouragement from the instructors. I have purchased all the other Fitness packs as well so I am committed to using this daily to stay in shape. My stamina has vastly improved and it make exercise fun.

2999,Oathable,"Jul 31, 2020 at 7:16 AM",2,Disappointed but could be fixed,"I‚Äôve played boxvr consistently over the past month and have loved how I get into a rhythm, but this new update‚Äôs new interfaced while in game is just really bumming me out.

I‚Äôll just list some complaints in hopes the devs will POSSIBLY look:

CONS of update:

The hit meter and hit streak now uses some kind of power punch feature, so if you don‚Äôt hit with a specific speed, it counts as a miss. So your hit streak is always going to be low - especially on long term songs since the hit speed for a  power punch is based off your max speed

I liked keeping track of misses versus this weird power punch thing. Its not fun seeing like a 60 max hit streak after like 30 minutes

The calorie counts are also gone until the end, which I‚Äôm not sure why since I used that to track my progress and manage hit speed as well.

The time is also moved to the top left corner which is MUCH harder to see, i like keeping track of the time but now if you look you will probably miss

The maps you can choose is now forced to the one generic map which i guess is OK, but I miss the old choices.

PROS of update 

The new punching seems a bit more responsive albeit most being counted as ‚Äúmiss‚Äù because its not a power punch (its really annoying see my complaint in the cons section)

The new way the songs are organized is a bit more modern looking now, but I‚Äôll need more time with them to get the full experience

The level system and points are a lot more interesting than before and gives a sort of goal to head towards

The new gloves feel a lot more optimized and positions on the controllers"

3003,Auto,"Aug 19, 2020 at 11:23 PM",4,Best workout I have found on VR,"I box and train to fight so I do know what I am doing but I feel this is the next step in VR workouts. This is a very fun game that you actually have to put effort and force into your punches. You can set your intensity, but you have to make an effort because it can tell if you are slacking. You can't just stand there and punch. If you want to do well, you got to be ready and on your toes. Very fun, depending on the intensity, you can walk away pooring sweat, in under ten minutes."
3004,Eoin,"Aug 19, 2020 at 9:13 PM",4,Love the update,Really enjoying the update! The environment looks better and I love the element of competing with other users. Had some issues where I've punched and it was registered but still lost my streak. Maybe I'm doing it wrong. Fully recommend though. Love the class of the day option. Great easy way to exercise at home!
3005,HottestManGravy,"Aug 20, 2020 at 12:31 AM",4,Best game in my library,"I bought my Quest to play silly action games, but bought this as an afterthought.  I didn‚Äôt really think of vr as a fitness tool, but I think it might be my favorite way to stay in shape.   It‚Äôs fun, gets you a seriously good workout, and you don‚Äôt even notice your body is tired until after your workout.   

My only complaint is the lack of variety.  There‚Äôs one stage to workout in and the music selection is very limited.  I‚Äôd kill for an outdoor park level.  

Overall, I highly recommend this game!"

3013,Jon,"Apr 5, 2020 at 2:43 AM",5,"AMAZING for cardio, but boxers beware!","I'm a boxing instructor who's studied the art pretty intimately. I've worked with beginners and taught them good habits, taught them general principles of combat, etc. I'm currently an aspiring amateur MMA fighter, and I guess you could say I love fighting in general.

Okay, now that I've got my credentials out of the way, let me praise this game, but with a caveat.

This game is AMAZING for weight loss. Creative levels. You ARE going to have to learn to throw combinations that are going to seem awkward for most (how can you throw consecutive uppercuts and feel like they'd actually hurt anyone?) but they can be smoothed out.

Okay NOW. BOXERS BEWARE. Boxing in VR can make you develop bad habits. You must ALWAYS be checking yourself inside VR, and ALWAYS shadowbox in real life. Slipping is an issue. You need to be able to do so on a dime, and if it you do it with the appropriate ferocity and suddenness, you basically throw the VR headset off your face and have to re-adjust. Blocking is awkward, and can't be done properly due to the limitations of the Quest.

Specifically in this game, it encourages you to slip and duck. I was afraid that it would make you move your head WAY out of the center line, but, in my experience, it does a wonderful job making you slip *just enough*. So you can keep your slips nice and tight. You never want to exaggerate a slip - you're dodging a punch, not a wrecking ball.

You work in a simple rhythm, which can be useful to a degree, but it's not the INSANELY complex rhythm of an actual fight. GET SPARRING EXPERIENCE! You're trying to disrupt their rhythm while making your own unpredictable. That's one of the hardest parts of boxing. Don't let this game condition you.

When you hit an incoming ball, do so SUDDENLY. Don't telegraph!

Performing hooks on an incoming target is helpful - hooking a speeding object takes practice, and is practical.

GREAT GAME OVERALL! YOU WILL LOSE WEIGHT!"

When this is possible I will change my opinion to 5 stars. Because it is the only failure that I see."
3017,Gary,"Aug 1, 2020 at 4:54 PM",4,A better workout with room to improve,"When BoxVr disappeared I was surprised. It was my go-to VR exercise app. So let's talk about the FitXR that has replaced it. Overall I got a better workout. That's a plus! but it's lacking polish and makes it feel like in a few months it'll be as fully fleshed out as BoxVR was. Quick pros and cons ‚Üì
 
**Pros**
- The new explosive meter is a good motivator to push yourself harder. 
- I haven't seen pauses when songs switch like I did BoxVR
- The online classes are motivating. You can choose to do a class online or solo. If you go online you'll get a leaderboard with everyone else and it helps push yourself to move up the ranking. 

**Cons**
- More limited customization (not that Box was really that customizable but this is even less). You can't change the environment, make custom ""classes"", change glove/target color, etc...
- ""Streak"" is now really ""explosive streak"" (more about this below ‚Üì)
- Doesn't have detailed stats at the end. (like exactly how many moves were hit by category.)

**Improvment requests**
Here are the things that could be improved.

- Either give the option to have streak really be a total streak or have both. Explosive is like a sprint and you can't sprint for a full class. I used to always strive for a ""perfect"" class where I didn't miss a target. No it doesn't matter because you have one not explosive move and it's over. I went from getting 1000 plus streaks to 30. (Hit a fast punch section and it's over)
- Add more environments. Depending on my mood the future techno look is cool but lots of time I would choose the gyms to feel more real/connected. An amazing feature would be to have the targets look like actual training mitts in an old gym. It would give it a ""Rocky"" fewl which for a lot of people would be motivating. Even make it a chargeable add on and I'd buy it. 
- Add detailed stats on the class before you start. I'd like to see how many punches/squats are in a class. For Leg day I'd want a squat heavy option but can't find it."
3018,TheName,"Aug 19, 2020 at 8:30 AM",3,Hit accuracy issues,"It used to work fine as BoxVR, and then as FitXR. Couldn‚Äôt be happier, used to do 1.5K streaks, up to 3K. 
Though for the last week or two occasionally getting sequences of missed hooks and uppercuts, up to 10 in a row. Sometimes it‚Äôs a miss, other times it explodes not in a place where I hit it but around my shoulder. This is very annoying. Jabs still work fine all the time. I hope this will get fixed, that‚Äôs the only reason to give any less than 5 stars to this app."
3019,SnuggG,"Aug 19, 2020 at 11:17 PM",3,Much better,"I just enjoyed the NEW update..ill explore more


Edit: Why are we paying for an update with new songs? I'm getting bored with the reg version. We have been asking for an update but now we have to pay extra. Looking for something different. Smh.
How come there are no water breaks? when I do pause it takes me completely out of the game. We also need more then just 3 sceneries to wk in. I also would like to jump over something so I could work more of my legs. If I choose a 45 min workout it will not allow me to use my own music. I've created music for an hour of workout time but sometimes I would like to try different classes. So this means I need to create music for different workouts, ugh. This game is the best, like everyone else wish we could listen to our own spotify music. I absolutely love it my entire body has been sore, I just started playing last week and I'm sweating like crazy. Cant wait to melt those stubborn pounds away"

3023,tom1221,"Jul 31, 2020 at 7:40 PM",4,I‚Äôm Mixed,"I love the update and can see that the developers have spent a significant amount of time working on it. The update to FitXR makes the application look cleaner and more modern. 

However, I do feel like I‚Äôm missing not being able to choose my environment as I liked being able to have a darker one in the evening and lighter in the morning. 

I also feel that the developers should have listened to the consumers more as features that have long been requested like custom songs are nowhere to be seen. I completely understand the change of the app as the new name makes far more sense and hopefully will expand to more than just punching. I‚Äôd also like to see the exploding animation minimised slightly to make it feel less like a video game.

Overall I see this update as a starter to a more advanced and well designed application in the future. The app experience is fantastic and offers a good workout. Would highly recommend and look forward to how it will be in the future!"
3024,ravenx25,"Aug 4, 2020 at 5:34 AM",4,Its so much better,"At first I was upset that they changed my favorite workout game and when I went to play my first few games I was angry, however after playing a few games  my opinion quickly changed and I  fell in love with FitXR. The game is completely different now but in a good way, it's harder and you burn more calories I burned 450 calories in 30 minutes, I found this new version of the game so good that I purchased the new DLC.
 I love the new  multiplayer because it makes you work harder. However there is a Bug in multiplayer where you get DC after a few minutes of play but you still can continue the match solo..
If you arelooking for an amazing workout this is the game.

Update:  ok after playing for 2 days 
I now know you cant use your own music anymore' the multiplayer is a joke  its bots not real people and after the first song they freeze.
They need to fix the combos and finally the daily excersise  class does not change it just stays the same....fix your game or you will lose your players I gave this 5 stars but now i give it a four"
3025,cyberfox,"Aug 23, 2020 at 4:35 PM",5,Multiplayer + scoreboard is amazing!!,"Really like the musics also,  could we change environment though? Like dancing in a forest (or in the rain..)  for example."
3026,Renae,"Aug 4, 2020 at 6:30 AM",3,Fun but frustrating!,"I lost 70lbs using the BoxVR version so I was curious what they changed about the FitXR and I felt like they just tried to make it seem too much like the other fitness apps and took away the boxing feel. The streaks are frustrating because I was on an intense level and I hit every single one of those punches and yet my streaks would only be on average 3-4 with my max being 50, while in the other game my streaks would be in the thousands. 

I‚Äôm not sure what the leveling up really does, and I didn‚Äôt really care about it as a whole or used it to track anything. I‚Äôm focused more on how many hits I can land and the power level (which I wish would be more eye level). 

Multiplayer was exciting at first and I love a good competition, but everyone always quit within the first five minutes. I‚Äôd win but it felt more like a participation trophy. 

One suggestion for a future update is have the punches rotate 360 degrees in order to simulate a boxing experience and have block moves come to your sides. It‚Äôll get a lot more footwork involved. 

Overall, I‚Äôm still going to use it for now but I definitely want to see improvements if I‚Äôm going to continue to use it. Thanks for your hard work trying to stay relevant though!"
3027,Migbuster,"Aug 19, 2020 at 3:00 AM",3,So far good but...,"I‚Äôve read some of the reviews so mostly my concerns and issues or likes have been already written.

Also yes please put the option back for the custom workout and to favorite single songs ;

The graphics are more visually interesting in this version too.

Having the old version available as an option would be nice.  As much as I like the updates, the flashing lights are making a couple of my workout buddies avoid this app now.

I found 2 ....bugs?
1.  The streak counter only counts hits with the power aura.  A good hit without the power light ring  resets the counter to 0..... That's...discouraging.   Can you either fix it so it counts all good hits or rename that counter a 'power streak' counter?

2.  It needs an exit button in the game.  It's weird to that the Occulus button is the only way out.  It could even be an exit door in the gym lobby by the desk."

3039,Meiica,"Aug 13, 2020 at 11:41 PM",4,Good update with huccups,"I've played this previously as BoxVR before deciding to get it for myself with the new FitXR update.

This review focuses on the parts that can be improved but the overall experience is positive.

Fitness Level: Less intense than Supernatural, More Intense than Beat Saber. Expect to put in 30+ mins to feel it once used to the game; Possibly 15 if your are going at all your punches hard. For me it works great for warmup/cool down or days you want to take it a bit easier but still get in exercise. This of course depends on your own fitness level. In my opinion its the perfect way to start getting back into shape if you have been away from it for awhile or just getting started without feeling overwhelmed.

Space Required: Minimal, you face one direction and don't need to lunge or move from where you are making it perfect for those tight on space.

Biggest Gripe: In BoxVR, you were able to adjust the hand position in relation to the glove(hitbox) this made it so if you felt your hits were not connecting you could adjust the position of the gloves to better match your actual punches. This feature seems to be removed from the new FitXR and I am missing many hits that I think should connecting. This can be a huge distracting when playing because I find myself thinking about when to swing so it registers with the game rather than being emmersed into the experience. Other games like Supernatural and Beat Saber overcomes this obstacle by giving you a bat/saber which has a very large hitbox area so you are less likely to feel cheated. I would suggest bringing back the adjustment option on top of increasing a invisible hitbox area around the gloves or targets. I understand a concern may be that people with previous scores may feel a bit cheated when people beat their scores with easier hitboxes or to large of an increase would feel you are being rewarded for misses, it is about finding a happy balance that I think FitXR could benefit from and would make the exerperience much more enjoyable. With that said it's not terrible maybe even improved over the default hand glove position from the past just takes some getting used to.

2nd Gripe: This one is more minor to me but as others have stated, it would have been nice if they kept the old environments and just added to that instead of removing the old content.

Knit Picking 1: Some tracks have to many repeated sections that go on far to long, for example straight punch, dodge right, straight punch dodge right. Over and over till the point, where I'm like alright geez give me something new, it is often followed up by a repeated reverse section later in the song but does get a bit irritating usually happens with instrumentals.

Knit Picking 2: Voice Encouragment, its a decent addition but lacks a bit of energy and excitement in the voices, be better if they sounded like they were doing the workout with you.

Knit Picking 3: Multi-player is a bit misleading as it is recorded ghosts, I still like it but woukd be nice to have the option to wait in a queue and actually play live with others, maybe even have the ghosts in there as well to fill the rest of the room after queue time expires after first live person joins with a different name color for live players. Would be hard to have enough live players doing all the songs all the time as you start so my suggestion would be you select a intensity level then it does it by single song and you can continue or quit out as you go, that way the longest you wait is one song. 

Knit Picking 4: Calories are way off but thats expected without a heart rate monitor, Even though its way off, I still find it good motivation.

I do really like the addition of how fast your punches are. It's not perfect for example you can get it to go to 8.2 max with an intentionally slower punch then clearly punch faster but it won't budge but, its still a good motivator and welcomed addition.

Suggestion for Devs: Add in outward and downward hits to bring more variety to the game.

Verdict: Overall a good experience with room to improve."
3040,StrutZ76,"Aug 12, 2020 at 6:44 PM",4,Almost There...,"First off let me say overall I love most of the updates from BoxVR to FitXR. The punching power meter and calculations seem to be much better. Updated look is clean. Great app overall! 

BUT!!! My favorite part of BoxVR was being able to host a private class with my mom who lives out of state. Great way for ous to start our mornings and have some competitive fun. At first I thought this functionality was hidden behind a new menu but was astonished to find out you guys scrapped live multiplayer in favor of some ghost saved sessions from other other users. Really??!! Whoever thought this was a good move needs to be counseled. I am praying this was a temp fix due to network syncing or something because this is a MAJOR step back. Couple that with not having the option to access BoxVR anymore, I am very disapointed. Please fix this!!!"

3044,PyHat,"Aug 15, 2020 at 12:07 AM",3,Rename game to "floating hand simulator","Great fitness game, but it has a major flaw. There are issues with hand tracking and the gloves/hands start floating. This happens every 8-10 hits, then an annoying sounds plays telling you it was your mistake. This isn't happening when going through the menu, only in the game. Just when you get into the game, the game stops with an extremely annoying sound asking you to change your stance. The floating hands only happen in this game and that should be fixed before cashing in on add-ons. It's not caused by my quest (only game with this issue), lighting situation or anything else. This issue was also there before this game was re-branded. It also takes too long now to get into a game. Please also remove the pictures from trainers, that adds zero value. Nobody cares about those pictures, trust me."

I can hit most of the notes, but the gloves are always jittery and some drift and snap into place as move the controllers farther away from my face. Much of this is do to the tracking limitations of the quest, however some of it is the game itself since tracking is much better on other games.

In a nutshell, it's brilliant. A bit samey with regards to what you have to do, although it does mix it up and you can vary the intensity and the length of exercise. Overall though, aside from not being a fan of the music, this is brilliant assuming you stick to it.
I've been on, on average twice a day for a good 20 minutes per session. First time, i was aching the next day. Because you feel like you're essentially inside a game, you forget you're exercising until the sweat starts soaking your t-shirt.
I am looking forward to seeing how long it takes me to lose the weight I've somehow gained since Feb/March. I feel better in myself already though, and I only got this 3-4 days ago.

I'd give 5 stars if you could play your own music through it somehow, but you can't have it all."

If you want a light class to warm up, dont be embarrassed if you find yourself floundering on some but then setting class records on others. This new release needs better criteria and review of each class before assigning a difficulty rating to help users select appropriately and to avoid injury."
3066,butlerswa,"Aug 10, 2020 at 3:38 AM",3,,"BoxVR was the second app I bought for my Quest and I really enjoyed it.   When FitXr replaced it, my first impression was positive but after several days I became increasingly frustrated with it.  Still, I decided to wait for the first patch before reviewing.  It's better, but still has a ways to go.

Pros: 
 - It has a clean look and I like the new look of the targets. 
 - It's still a great workout.  

Cons:
- The graphics/particle explosion thing.  It's really distracting even toned down and I think it's a large part of why it's hard to maintain streaks
- Hook accuracy is inconsistent, especially left hook.  I hit what looks like a solid punch at a good speed and I still lose my streak
- I'm looking for a workout, it being a game is secondary.  Some of the high speed rounds feel game-y to me  ""let's throw a bunch of dodges and tricky combos at high speed to make the game harder.""  Especially with the visual distractions, this can be really frustrating for someone just trying to work out.
- Internet required

Neutral:
- The whole ""ghost"" class just seems silly to me.   
- I don't have a strong opinions about the venue change

If I only had one request to make it better:
- Let me turn down the punch graphics even further so I can see what's coming."

I've been ultra fit my whole life, but a new position at work, and a new learning curve has had me literally bound to a desk for months.  Also a Dad now with kids.  Needless to say I don't have much spare time...

Anyway,  feeling really unfit and my legs actually feel like they have actually atrophied.  Needed something that I can get done in 1 hour...no travel....no changing time....just 1 hour.

So I thought I would give this a go and wow it's good. I mean like really good! It's not as good as real boxing, but waaaay better than a boxercise class.  Combinations are harder and the pace is insane.  Regardless of how fit you are this can have you sweating

If you like boxing or boxercise and want to get fit with VR, I really recommend this."

I have also noticed that the online feature only works for the first song in workouts, at which point the players and leaderboard freeze, as if the workout has ended. If you bring back the features and fix the online workouts, I'll rate it 5 stars."
3070,Maxsophia,"Aug 5, 2020 at 5:12 PM",4,I'm on the fence...,"I have been using BoxVR for months. It has aided me in losing 40 pounds. It was my go to when the gyms were closed during the pandemic and the weather wasn't great. I was pretty excited when I saw that there was a new update.  So I've used the new platform a few times now and I'm not completely sold on it. 
I do like some of the changes. I think the multiplayer option is nice. To see others scores like you're in a class..sort of.  I think it's a nice, clean change with the surroundings.  However I did like the option of choosing your studio.   In the previous layout, I would get entire classes with 100 percent accuracy with the streaks. This new one, it's much more difficult.  Now, I am just getting used to it but if you dont punch as hard as you can and perfectly center, it's a no go and sends you right back to zero. My favorite class  is Let's work because of the many, many punches, the fast pace and the music but with the new design it's a whe new ball game.. I am really hoping there are some bug fixes. I hit hard and on target and it doesnt count. Some just fly by although I hit them accurately.  Of course it wont roll out and be perfect. And that's ok. I am going to continue to try to use it and hopefully with enough comments they will figure it out and make everything better than it was."

Now to buy a better face cover to replace the sweat soaking sponge.. 

Original review:

This game is fantastic and a great workout! Only issue I encounter on Quest is sometimes hits won't register if your gloves aren't on the screen when you go to swing. Uppercuts take a little getting used to but once you get into the swing of things the combos are so fun!"

3079,theswader,"Aug 4, 2020 at 11:46 AM",4,A *different* game than BoxVR,"I don't think it's fair to compare this game to BoxVR as it's completely different.

My VR Cardio sessions consist of me strapping a 1kg wrist weight on every wrist and going for 30 minutes. In BoxVR, the game didn't care about the speed of my hits, so just lifting the arm to tap the targets registered and I felt like I did my job. I used to spend some ~120 calories per workout (as measured by Garmin and BoxVR both, but neither counted the weights).

With FitXR, I do 350 calories per workout. Again, neither Garmin nor FitXR take my wrist weights into account, so it's probably closer to 400 plus a good shoulder workout.

What I'm saying is, I like this change because it makes my workouts more intense in the way I want them to be more intense.

That said, there's lots to dislike: only one gym, multiplayer is iffy (all players disconnect sometimes so you're left alone which is great for your leaderboard but not very competitive), there are no progress or completion indicators on the classes so you don't know which ones you've already done, there's no customization, in general it's much more on-rails and rigid, you get your hand held, whereas BoxVR was more a sandboxy thing. The music is better in FitXR though, at least so far!"
3080,ACarolan26,"Aug 5, 2020 at 7:14 AM",4,,When I saw that Boxvr had been updated to this new game I was very interested to see what was changed as I had given up on using VR for fitness but once I tried a few of the classes I was instantly hooked and I feel like I can‚Äôt stop trying new workouts. There are a few minor complaints I have like with the whole system now being based around power over accuracy is kind of annoying because the workouts can get kind of tiring after a short time and it makes it kind of difficult to hit those quick combos that come at you while playing but maybe in a future update we could see a feature to choose between wanting to do a power focused workout or just a regular workout like the old Boxvr. All in all I love this new game and I‚Äôm feeling extremely motivated to workout everyday and the new scoring system plays a huge role in my motivation and I always strive to reach the top level and keep my streaks going.
3081,Andrew Southworth,"Aug 4, 2020 at 11:47 PM",4,Great Workout in VR,"For someone like me who has a desk career, I sit down in front of a computer upwards of 16 hours per day. I don't have time to commit going to a gym multiple times per week, so for me its much easier to be able to pop on a VR headset randomly throughout the day and get a quick workout in. 

Since I don't move much, the workouts in this game are genuinely exhausting. The light category workouts are a solid workout, but the moderate category ones leave me completely beat after only 10 minutes. In my case this is the most convenient way to improve my health and fitness level. 

The only reason its 4 stars and not 5 stars is because the punches aren't always in sync to the music, and there were some features removed during the transition from BoxVR to FitXR. I'm sure over time they'll improve this so i'm hopeful that this will become a 5 star experience.

I see a lot of people saying they wish it was harder, and i'm sure over time i'll get to that point as well. But if you're not in shape this should keep you challenged for quite a while."
3082,njallain,"Aug 4, 2020 at 3:26 AM",4,"Some good, some bad with the upgrade","First off, so for it's the best workout app I've used on on the Quest.  I'm old enough that I can't run every day, and it's good to have an alternate workout that focuses on upper body.

With the upgrade from BoxVR there's a lot of good:
- turn off squats/dodges on any workout (I don't think they add a lot and they disrupt the flow of punching the heck out of things sometimes)
- favoriting workouts (wanted this almost immediately)
- search by songs, length, intensity (I'm not really a hip hop fan)
- the combos only count when you're hitting with enough speed.  This can be good and bad (if the hits are coming to fast, I can get enough speed to continue a combo streak)

The bad:
- Lag, lag , lag.  I occasionally got performance problems before, but way more now.  They need to really reduce the frame drops.  I suspect its the new fancy effects (which are overdone - I'd be fine if they just toned it down a lot)
- After the upgrade I had to go through the tutorial again.  Seriously, just give me a skip button.
- Creating an account.  This infuriated me.  Creating an account for a game I paid for and had been using for a while for some social aspect that I will always have disabled?  No thank you (yet I had no choice...again, for a game I already paid for and had been using!)
- The calorie count is way out of wack.  No I did not burn 1000 Calories in 26 minutes.  In my 45-50 min workout my watch measure about 600ish which is probably close given the amount I flail around wildly.  Pre-upgrade to FitXR the calorie count seemed a bit more realistic.

So, the only issue I really need them to fix is the performance (since I already had to deal with the tutorial and the account).  Fixing the calorie would be good, but I'm fine measuring it without their help. It's still a great workout app for days where I can't do something else"

Because of this, Covid-19 has meant I‚Äôm well-and-truly housebound for the time being, and this has been having a big impact on my fitness.

Then I decided to add BoxVR to my Oculus collection and haven‚Äôt looked back. For nearly a month now I have got up early, before the kids, every day to have a fun-yet-challenging workout. I‚Äôve slowly worked my way up from doing shorter sessions to a full hour (and often add on an extra twenty-minutes), burning around a thousand calories each day. Because of the nature of my disability I sometimes feel too weak to do the ducking and dodging, and on those days am able to select a workout that doesn‚Äôt require them (this option also works for wheelchair users).

BoxVR is a great workout that allows you to ease yourself in (or jump straight in) to the difficult stuff and is plenty of fun to boot. I‚Äôd thoroughly recommend it to people of all abilities."

3088,AJ,"Aug 2, 2020 at 1:44 PM",4,,"I gave it a 4 instead of 5 due to not having the old environments that reminded me of Mirrors Edge and Tron. Now if they had targets a little bigger size coming at you unless there they in the settings if missed then perfect 5. 

Negatives over, I like the old version and I like this One with more in depth stats on daily/weekly/monthly feedback. The music in the gym entrance is calming, lessons look more categorised, in MP you see other peoples avatar type score board and with hope in the near future they bring back the old environments as an option for a work out setting.

Anyway, I quite like the new layout. It'd be nice to have a choice of more than one venue, but it's a better venue than the previous three, so that's good. I like the way the playlists are sorted by genre and pace, and have discovered a couple of new ones accordingly.

I do have a couple of issues though. The sensitivity seems to be very different. I was regularly racking up 1.000+ streaks but in FitVR it was simply not recognising my uppercuts or left hooks. I found out by overemphasising the actions, almost ridiculously so, it would recognise them. That needs tweaking. Also, please allow the option to turn off the explosion effects if hit a target. It's very off-putting, as many have commented.

I'm glad you can turn off the commentary. That wasn't for me!

All in all, a positive start, but please sort out those two issues and it'll be a good upgrade."

3099,Gordon,"Aug 2, 2020 at 7:26 AM",4,FitVR,"Replaced BoxVR, still essentially the same but has some bugs to work out. First off there is no quit or exit to leave the game.  I don't know what is going on with the hit counter, I think it is supposed to be tracking power hits in a row but I see the power bar showing with jabs at about a 4 getting counted and uppercuts and crosses showing a 6-8 power but count as a miss. It would be nice to track which classes have been done and how well it was performed so that a player could return and try to better their stats. The multi player bit isn't working well, after about 5 minuts all the other players are dropped and you finish against a group that isn't playing.  A more minor thing that I'll probably get used to is the barriers are blue coming from an area with the same blue back ground, a number of times I'm focused on the targets the suddenly notice the barrier is coming, so a colour change or a choice of colours would be nice.  I'm hoping / expecting these issues will get delt with, and I continue to play as it is still a good fitness based game."

3101,Ray,"Aug 1, 2020 at 10:39 PM",4,Great fun and workout idea,"So, I was surprised by the change of name and then by the new look... 
Except some parts, I did like the look, but I like it even more now!
The waiting room looks cool, and the gym as well.
Overall, I gave it one star more , coming up to 4 now.

For me, this doesn't feel like a prototype anymore, so those things that bother me, even weight in more ...
(Maybe I should stay at a three then ?)

Menue 
I don't know what it is, but the menu feels unsorted to me. Labels don't fit the button size .. and I always want to use the b button to go back, but I can't. Why not use the navigation that is set by oculus already ? Why the need if a ""back"" button in the UI? 
Also, not seeing als Infos in a class within the overview makes it an unnecessary back and forth for me...

Integration...
It's cool to see , how many calories I have burned and the time I spend in class... Now I want to have that connected to my Google fit account (or one of the many other fitness tracking accounts...)

Multiplayer...
I feel a little fooled... I first thought ""so many people using the app at the same time and taking the same class as I""!!... But those recordings don't make the deal, really! Also, in two out of 3 classes, the other players did nothing but beeing there... 
Make it real multiplayer, but don't take and pretend.. we ain't stupid you know !



before :
Overall I really like it. It makes workout fun and something I'm looking forward too, every day.

Still at the moment it would get more then three stars from me. 
There are basics that just really need to br polished, I think.

The sound design
Like when you hit or miss... It just doesn't feel satisfying at all.
Plus, some of the tracks don't feel like real music, more like someone just put up a beat and clames it would be a real tune... I think the music is way to essential to be the way it is.

The punsh balls...
The way they are designed, reminds me of a prototype I would come up with, while showing the first draft, straight out of unity. They are missing the love and design. The gyms look so nice, even the locker room.. just nice and beautyfull... But those N64 punsh balls don't fit the scenery at all....

Gloves...
The same with the gloves... For me they kind of break the design style and the overall feel...
Also, they tend to just ""slip away"" for a few frames, which can make you miss a ball.... 
No glove equals no punsh equals no points equals frustration...

The UI..
Maybe I am just not getting it, but for me the menu looks unstructured.
Creating a playlist was far from self-explanatory. And still, I didn't manage to save one and use it as a workout.

The price....
All these things added to a price....
The price feels premium , and to much to have cheap looking details , N64 kind of music, and UI that is not UX oriented, including functions that don't seem to work..."
3102,Metal Aria,"Aug 1, 2020 at 6:06 PM",4,"I hated the previous version, but now?","When I first download this gamer in its previous incarnation, I found that I would give up because I could NOT consistently align the side swipes and upper cuts to save my life. 

But then the new release came out. The UX was cleaner, and the ‚Äúexercise path‚Äù became easier to navigate.

Now I still have some challenges with upper cuts, but they are leaning curves (and depth perception issues of my own) that I can adapt and overcome.

As a larger person leveraging XR to exercise, this is a great app. Still frustrated at times, but I think that‚Äôs user error vs bad UX now.

Very exciting to see the game being given such an overhaul by its developers!!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

OLD REVIEW: Box VR is part of my daily workout now. I bought it during lockdown, back in March, and it‚Äôs been fantastic to use as a workout game. Both my wife and I have used it regularly and time flies when you‚Äôre in the zone!

The game has a good mix of songs, is very accessible and works well within limited space. Most importantly it makes you sweat and - with longer durations - really puts you through your paces.

However, it‚Äôs the most bugged game I have on the Quest. LOTS of crashes, rendering it unplayable, and I‚Äôve tried everything to make it work well. I even emailed the devs directly, but got no response. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs 50/50 if it‚Äôll work seamlessly, and from reading comments this experience seems to be a shared one. I‚Äôve probably got 40+ games on the Quest and really this is the only one that crashes the system and requires force resets. 

The game could do with more songs, more environments, and more variance in the exercises. Otherwise it could risk becoming stale extremely quickly. Yes, I know there‚Äôs DLC, but at ¬£22.99 I really don‚Äôt want to have to buy additional content whilst the main game is seemingly untouched and unimproved. 

There‚Äôs also a number of things that could be improved:

*More environments - just to mix it up!

*Scoreboards - to motivate you to try harder

*Better labelling of workouts - what song genre is it, for example? Right now it‚Äôs a lucky dip.

*Favouriting workouts - I have no idea why this isn‚Äôt already a feature

*Higher intensity workouts under 3 mins - just when you want a very quick and intense workout

 *Labelling tracks on-screen - so it‚Äôs easier to see the songs playing and add them to your own workout playlist. 

*Extra body movements - give us some more things to do during workouts! Whether it‚Äôs stepping, or rotating... anything!! Again, just to make the game feel fresher.

*Custom tracks - it works amazingly for Synth Riders and Oh Shapes; I‚Äôd love to see it cleanly implemented in this.

*New music OR rotating tracks - it‚Äôs be great to have  new tracks or at the least have tracks rotated in and out so there‚Äôs more reasons to play the game.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Honestly there‚Äôs probably about 30 other suggestions I could put forward, which to me shows how unloved this game appears to be with it developers as very little seems to have been done to update it in any significant way. It‚Äôs in dire need of a refresh, or at least a sequel game. I‚Äôd buy a BOX VR 2 if it was a big improvement over this version, but I don‚Äôt want to have to pay for DLC.

So it‚Äôs good, perhaps even very good... just not great. But it COULD be, and it wouldn‚Äôt need a major overhaul to get there either. I‚Äôd recommend it if you‚Äôre after a good workout game, but bearing in mind that exercise is a lot about motivation, this game needs to try harder to motivate you to want to keep playing it."
3104,Floigenkaspar,"Aug 4, 2020 at 10:49 PM",3,Don't listen to the haters,"The new update has a lot of potential. Seeing other players around and a live-Scoreboard motivates extremely, as well as having an indicator about your punch speed. For the first time I burned more than a thousand calories in one session without even noticing (using a Garmin device for measurement, not the in built calorie-counter). If they fix the basic problems this could be a revolution in home training. These problems are the reason for only three stars: The precision of the tracking has declined. Especially hooks are delayed and the animation of a successful punch happens too late. Also sometimes I lose a combo without any misses. Lastly: I only have community competition for about 5 minutes into the session. After that the connection seems lost- I can't see other players moving nor does their score change. 
If you fix these basics - this could become my absolute favourit app. Already with the flaws I'm really motivated to keep on throwing punches."

It would be good if there‚Äôs more workout to choose from, more songs and room to choose 

The multiplayer mode seems to have the rest of the player stop playing and I was left alone.  Not sure is that a glitch or what.  But it nice there‚Äôs challenge from others"
3108,NGB,"Aug 4, 2020 at 7:29 AM",3,A step backwards. But there's potential.,"I was a big fan of BoxVR but I am disappointed with the FitXR update.  Like others have noted, FitXR feels less fun, and I think there are a few reasons why.

First, as others have said, the hit detection on crosses and uppercuts is a problem.  I've been trying to figure it out but I can't seem to deduce why some swings register as explosive hits and some register as misses. If this is intended to demand precision and/or speed/power, then I would recommend adding an interactive tutorial so we can train and be instructed if we're swinging too early/late, not swinging with enough power, etc.  Absent that guidance, we're left to do our own experimentation with swing adjustments, which was never necessary in BoxVR, and seems like it could potentially pose a health risk.

Second, the decision to count only explosive hits in the streak counter may succeed in increasing the intensity, but it does so at the expense of a more natural ""flow"" that made long workouts in BoxVR a more enjoyable experience.  I like the idea of explosive hits, but personally would prefer to see them prompted --- perhaps by a different colored visual cue --- more intermittently and strategically, e.g. to punctuate the last 4 punches of a long combo, or timed to the biggest beat drops in the music.  To throw every punch in a combo as hard as possible feels unnatural and more of a chore than ebbing and flowing along with the music.

I do like the attempt at multiplayer, and it doesn't necessarily bother me if the player performances are recorded and not live.  But I've yet to try a class where any of the other players actually completes the class; most seem to play only the first few minutes, then drop out, which negates the competitive incentive.  I don't know if that's a glitch or a testament to how little other players are enjoying the classes.  But if I'm going to compete against bots, I'd prefer to only compete against those that fully complete the class.

The good news is, despite these gripes, FitXR feels like it could be just a few key gameplay tweaks away from returning to the ideal mix of challenging fun it previously had in BoxVR.  I am hopeful the developers will listen to the feedback from their longtime fans and deliver some updates to bring the fun back to this workout.  The potential for a truly great game/workout is there.  But until those updates come, I'll be spending a lot less time in FitXR than I did in BoxVR."
3109,Dan,"Aug 3, 2020 at 2:36 PM",3,MUST REVERT to OFFLINE PLAY,"I tried the new FitXR update and ABSOLUTELY LOVE it but you need to make it like the original and allow you to play it offline. I take mine to work every day and do the workout in my lunch break. I no longer will be able to do this. 

I agree that you should leave the option to connect to the old version and offline. Otherwise I won‚Äôt be able to do my weekly workouts any more. I used the original version daily. Now I won‚Äôt be able to with it requiring internet. 

In regards to the new version, the graphics are amazing and make the experience that much better. The music is ten times better too. Great selections. I love the new hip hop beats. The only other criticism that I have is that there isn‚Äôt enough longer higher intensity workouts and the ones that are there aren‚Äôt long enough (20 mins). I‚Äôm sure you will add more. The 20 Minute high intensity workout is AWESOME though. It pushed me. I think I did just short of 1000 calories in it too which is great. You have nailed this game. I am already ten times fitter as a result of the previous version. I will look forward to my work out even more now.  Please revert it to being able to be played offline. 5 stars if it could be played offline. Thanks"

Edit : thank you for giving a proper response. Not a generic copy and paste. ( it‚Äôs rare but welcome to see )
I will 100% update my review should updates fix these issues and enhance it. I also realize there will be teething problems. 
I‚Äôd love to give the update 5 stars but currently it‚Äôs more frustration than fun. And there is also no way to see which levels you have played. 
Hopefully these issues are looked at because BoxVR was a great fun way to burn some calories, and this has just added frustration into that mix."

2-some of the old songs seems to be missing.  I got the juice and Stunt where just 2 great songs i cant find anymore. 
3- environment is cool but i miss the gym look/feel. Also miss picking whichever of the 3 environments were available.  Ive always thought there should be more options than just three.

Well done."
3119,ShawnMV,"Jul 31, 2020 at 4:06 AM",4,Very fun for the most part,"BoxVR has been my favorite VR app, played almost everyday. Now we have this update to FitXR and I want to like it and everything seems great and moving in the right direction, but I have run into some issues that I did not have before.  

Not all my hits register so my streaks are low, with BoxVR you hit it or miss it and it was very obvious. Now all indications are that I hit and hit correctly, but the counter shows a miss. If I am not hitting correctly then there should be some indication so that I can correct for it. It should not explode and produce the feel like I hit it if I missed or did not hit it correctly.

The other issue is that it disconnects me saying I don‚Äôt have an internet connection, but I exit the game and everything is connected just fine and no indication that connection ever dropped.  Once this happens your class ends as if it crashed.  Whether the connection is actually dropping or not it would be better to just drop out of multiplayer and let the class continue.  The basic purpose is fitness, everything else is a bonus and makes it fun.  If the class ends due to a perceived disconnect it is like stopping in the middle of workout which is never good.  If I want to play for a 10 minute class but it kicks me at 5 then it is kind of a loss.

At any rate I am hoping these will work out over time because I really am a big fan if this!"
3120,Lyra,"Aug 2, 2020 at 5:06 PM",3,BoxVR all change,"I understand some people are genuinely angry at having their original purchase drastically altered and I totally sympathise.

So, keeping it short:

Pros
*Power meter... Definitely pushes you harder.
*Workout coach audio.... Not too intrusive  and pushes you along.
*Exploding rings... Fine for me, but can see how some might find them distracting.

Cons
* Uppercuts still VERY glitchy. To the point where I'm seriously slowing my speed to avoid losing my streak. And that often doesn't work.
* Single environment only.
* No customisable  playlists. 
*Are there now LESS songs? I'm in my 50s and a fair chunk of this music is like fingers down a blackboard. Lol.

3121,Olandersson,"Aug 2, 2020 at 7:13 PM",3,Downgrade and upgrade,"I loved BoxVR. When this update came through I was curious. On paper everything seemed better. In reality? Its a mixed bag.

Pros:
-Better workouts.
-Design feels more slick.
-Looks better.
-The ability to turn off squats. I love em, but not everyone does.
-Explosiveness meter.

Cons:
-Lag issues during songs that wasnt there in BoxVR.
-Tracking issues, same as above.
-Settings only let you adjust volume.
-Loading takes a long time, both starting it up and loading into a song.
-The colorexplosion when hitting, its just purely in the way. Give us an option to turn that off at least.

I feel like they either tried to push through too much so the performance of the Quest cant handle it all that well. Or that they optimized the game poorly, at least worse than BoxVR was. My biggest issues with the update is performance related. Which connects with eachother. It gets even worse when you try to record or cast the screen aswell, to a point where the misses racks up to a level that makes me quit the game.

I really would like different environments aswell, this current one feels dark and depressing to me.

FitXR went from 5/5 as BoxVR to 3/5 now. I wanna love it, but I cant in its current state. Im too competitive to let that slide even if the workouts are better and its a prettier game."

3123,sneakyaneurysm,"Aug 2, 2020 at 5:03 PM",3,BoxVR vs FitXR,"I played the BoxVR game every day for over a week and I really enjoyed it! It made my workout fun!

The best things about BoxVR was the great wide ranging songs and number of workout types. Some were actually challenging as you became more used to the game. And best of all, it recorded your streak based on what you didn‚Äôt miss! There were some great venues to play in as well, so the view rarely became dull.

The new FitXR has a better system for showing the stats during the sessions and the floating targets are a better design. But, the range of difficulties and songs is lacking. There‚Äôs only one venue, making the look and feel too one sided. And it doesn‚Äôt record your hit streak, only the streak of power hits. The new power hitting is pretty cool, but to try and get a long streak is difficult without throwing your shoulders out.

If they could bring back the multiple venues, better song choices, better range of difficulty in the basic pack, that would make this game so much better.

Also, I purchased the extreme pack thinking it would at least make FitXR on par with BoxVR, but it doesn‚Äôt.

One last thing, and this is a huge feature request! It would be great to have users make their own sessions and share them with the community! You could look through a list of available songs, record the session, tweak it to match the desired beat, and share it!"

Congrats on a good workout experience.  I‚Äôve been using BoxVR to get back into shape, and it‚Äôs something i use in my daily regimen.

That said, improvements can be had.  Quite noticeably, the hit targets are very small, and getting the timing on the hits are more challenging than it needs to be (depth perception is still challenging, and the space to register a hit tiny - perhaps that‚Äôs my age and a particular problem for my eyes (46 and with astigmatism).

Another area is with the dodge objects.  The left or right leaning dodges never work.  The only way to register a dodge for those is to squat down really low.  And a low squat doesn‚Äôt always register, and that varies according to the workout program being run.  

Even the vertical squat blocks are inconsistent, as squat to dodge, and watch my hit count revert to 0.  

While not a deal breaker, it ruins the experience of all the work you put into a workout.

Please clean up these little problems - while i still get the workout, these issues are nonsensical and takes away from the reward of using your program.

Maybe some weights, Pilates, yoga, things like that. I‚Äôve had a ‚Äúmom bod‚Äù for the past 1.5 yrs and wanted to get back in shape. So, I purchased Box VR and it‚Äôs been such a great workout. I literally bead sweat. (I suggest the silicone cover for your headset.) 

My suggestions...
1. MORE ENVIRONMENTS: maybe something scenic like grassy field or something that makes you feel empowered. 
2. LIST THE SONG NAMES: Add the songs under the workout classes. It‚Äôs easy to forget the class and whether I enjoyed it or not based on song selection and the workout. No hate, but one 18 min class had a church song and I know that can be motivating to many but not so much for me. 
3. GLOVE ISSUE: I‚Äôve talked with a few other VR boxers and they agree something strange about right uppercut move sometimes. Frustrating because I‚Äôll be on a perfect streak and for no fault of my own, I‚Äôll miss and my count starts again and that all throws me off. Idk. Still looking into that. Would also like to see glove color change options please. 
4. SOUNDS: Please get rid of the sound when you get 50 or something in a row. It sounds like I missed and it screws me up. Maybe a friendly sound or give option to toggle on and off. Honestly, I don‚Äôt care much about score but that I did the movements. It‚Äôs all about the workout. 
5. POSITION TRANSITIONS: sometimes the transition from one move to another is difficult. It‚Äôs more unnatural than hard. Go from double quick jabs to getting low to the ground. Think some workouts need more review.

All I can think of now. Hoping they can take some things into consideration. A lot of my apps have updates and this one doesn‚Äôt so would like to see constant improvements. Thanks!"

I do strongly wish it was able to connect and show your heart rate!! Even from my Fitbit etc 

Also a way to move around with your feet like basic boxing does 

A very obvious one.. why can‚Äôt one of the locations .. just be a gym!!??

Too bad it doesn‚Äôt have a speed bag or punch routine for warm ups. 

Wish paying extra for your extreme and essentials pack had longer sessions up to 60 mins. Instead of only 21min and 17

The extra packs whenever using any heavy metal music does not sync up at ALL with the routines. The dance music does great but definitely not the rock stuff. 

Like everyone says... it‚Äôs too bad you don‚Äôt have better / more popular music. Better sync licenses with popular artists would be amazing 

But my only true gripe.. you need new videos that explain proper techniques for your app.. for dodging and ducking and perfect form. Your current videos do nothing of the sort and shot in close ups and just terrible. I found myself watching other boxing videos on YouTube instead of from you guy to get started. They need to be redone and more added with clear wide and close up shots.  Showing footwork too for everyone to get better!"

My review is primarily aimed at those who want insights into whether this service can help improve their fitness.

SUMMARY OF REVIEW:
BoxVR is worthwhile for those interested in an exercise program that {a} stresses the upper body through boxing routines consisting of jabs, crosses, hooks, and uppercuts and {b} stresses the lower body through squats and leans. While exercising through BoxVR does not require an intimate knowledge of boxing, exercising through BoxVR becomes extremely more efficient with some familiarity with boxing.

SUMMARY OF MECHANICS/DIFFICULTY:
BoxVR doesn‚Äôt really have difficulty levels. Its difficulty curve insofar as one exists is derived from {a} the user‚Äôs power and {b} the user‚Äôs form. While routines do range from ‚Äúsimple‚Äù to ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù, difficulty is really a matter of whether the user can deliver a ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù punch efficiently. Consequently, users unfamiliar with boxing may want to familiarize themselves on how to throw a punch effectively. Unlike in Beat Saber where knowing how to properly wield a saber is not really useful to optimizing your exercise, in BoxVR knowing how to properly throw a cross, hook, and uppercut is very useful to optimizing your exercise.

SUMMARY OF MUSIC:
Music is generic mix of pop, rock, techno, and etc (no popular contemporary music). Unlike programs like Supernatural or Audica, BoxVR did not splurge on licensing (hence its relatively low cost).

SUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE:
I exercise extensively (2-3 hours daily) through a variety of rhythm games. I generally exercise through routines on the highest difficulty; consequently, my opinions may not be accurate for routines on lower difficulty."

3160,SuperMimi,"Aug 2, 2020 at 11:09 PM",3,Like the old one better,Doesn‚Äôt keep track of punch streak correctly. Pixelates quite often. There needs to be an update for some issues with the program.
3161,Kiyana,"Jul 5, 2020 at 7:46 PM",4,I my new go to app.,"Once again I‚Äôve been holding off on writing a review and today just felt like the day to leave one. I passed on this game so many times because I didn't think it was worth it, but come to find out it totally was worth the purchase. Although when I did get it was in a bundle so it was a win-win for me.  This game does make you work up a sweat while you get a good workout. I've heard of people say that they sweat a lot while playing this and I thought to myself no way. I quickly learned yes it true. I haven't purchased any additional packs yet, but I do believe that their are enough classes to keep you entertained. It has really good music to box too. 

I will say that every now and again I may experience tracking issues with my gloves and landing a punch, but it doesn't happen often. I love having recommended classes each day. I wish I could find more people utilizing the multiplayer feature, I really enjoy that as well as working out on survival mode that's a lot of fun. I'm glad I get to work out, work up a sweat all while having fun. Some classes  are repetitive but I'm ok with that. I think this is a good addition to anyone's library if they like working out, Best Saber, or Synth Riders."
3162,Mark,"Jul 23, 2020 at 6:24 AM",5,Great workout,"Really fun workout. Just wish it would force me to squat lower. I barely have to lower my head to clear them, and I can‚Äôt see a way to set my height."

3168,Coors,"Jul 3, 2020 at 5:47 PM",4,,Really love Box VR - great workout overall and love the music.  I will say though pretty much every time I use it there is a glitch.  I do maybe 3 10 minutes workouts or 2 15's and by the last one there will be a moment in the game when the balls coming at me freeze for a minute before correcting themselves like a stutter step.  Also once in a while it completely loses track of the controllers so I end up punching nothing and have to reboot.  I have not had those issues with any other games.  One suggestion I love the space age scenery and wish we had more than 3 to choose from especially since 2 are almost basically the same.  Would be great if you could add in some additional scenes to box in.

I'll be in the middle of a class and my glove will freeze in place and then the whole screen tips with my headset when I look around. Then to top it off, I can't get back to the Oculus homescreen until a message pops up saying there was a problem and asks if I want to close app. I'M TIRED OF MY WORKOUTS FREEZING AND LOSING PROGRESS!!!!

3173,RawrDeal,"Jul 17, 2020 at 9:04 AM",1,Not what it looks like,"I wanted to love this game, but it doesn‚Äôt allow you to do a full movement properly and still hit the target. The uppercuts and across the body punches are badly tracked, even after adjusting the gloves multiple times. Regular punches work fine tracking wise, but that‚Äôs a small part of the game. I‚Äôd like to see something that focuses on power and form over speed and music beats."

3182,seren.matthews,"Jun 8, 2020 at 6:04 PM",5,I play this all the time,"My favourite game on VR. I was super dubious about a real workout via a game. But seriously, it's a great workout, sometimes I don't notice how hard I'm working until I take the headset off and die all over the sofa. The points mechanic doesn't seem accurate at all and I've given up trying to work it out, or doesn't seem to correspond to hit power or timing. But don't let that or you off, ignore the points and just workout. Also the build your own tracklist is a great option, I wish they would improve it. The build your own options are often better than the preset. I think this is the ONLY good real workout game I've found on the quest. 100% recommend for a good sweat on."
3183,Hanjo,"Jun 23, 2020 at 4:38 PM",3,Fun but unstable,"This is quite a split review: I do like playing BoxVR to get rid of some extra-padding and could playfully lose some pounds thanks to this.
However, if you play if for pure achievements, it is VERY frustrating when your Quest randomly crashes after like 50 minutes of a 60 minute set, kicks you back and loses all progress. These bugs definitely need some attention.
Further it would be nice being able to add your own music (also on Quest)"
3184,Michael,"Jul 13, 2020 at 9:17 PM",1,Unsatisfied,"The game only works for me on the with Quest Link, Which means I need to be tethered to a PC.  The workout is pretty good, I can't go to a gym do the COVID lockdowns.  However, when running it on the Quest it crashes non stop. I haven't been able to use it for longer than 35 minutes before it crashed, once it even crashed after 3 minutes of use. I'd request a refund but still holding out hope they fix the software. I even filled out a support ticket on their site, I'm sure they'll tell me to email them like the others here. I have tried some basic troubleshooting myself and found many reports online of people having this same issue. Please do your research to see if this has been fixed before making a purchase."
3185,John,"May 22, 2020 at 9:49 PM",5,Definitely a great work out.,"I'm just an average guy with no boxing experience. When I got this I didn't really think anything of it. It is definitely a great workout. I just started playing today, May 22, 2020. I feel the endorfins run through me after a 14 minute run on the app. I'm happy I got it and hope it helps with weight lose. I'll update in a month or so. Stay healthy and safe during this pandemic."

3193,mark_dacre,"Jun 11, 2020 at 11:46 PM",5,Excellent Addition to Workout,"I picked up a VR headset specifically to buy this game. With the current state of the world, vis-a-vis the pandemic, I figured I needed a way to get my cardio in and unfortunately I‚Äôm just not the jogging type. 

This fits the bill for me and then some. I workout with some of the bands, dumbbells and kettlebells I have at home and then I follow it up with 30-45 minutes of boxing. I typically burn about 500 - 800 calories depending on the length of the session. That‚Äôs awesome! 

What really helped for me was adjust the gloves to a different position. This helps with registering all my punches correctly. 

Like others have stated, I do wish they‚Äôd add more music. The music, while very good imo, is starting to get a little stale. Hopefully the company is planning a major dlc release in the future."

1 option I think would be great to kick this app up a notch would be movement. Maybe having the targets come from different angles. As in another app Beat Saber they added the 90 deg and 360 deg options this might add a more complete workout. 

Thank you again 
Also I like the new trainers and maybe during the pauses between songs the trainers could talk and give some motivational inspirations or tips on what we are doing wrong or right

Just some ideas"

3201,Dennis Wayne Radcliffe,"Jun 7, 2020 at 10:29 PM",5,My Go To Workout,I can‚Äôt say enough about how this app gets my heart pumping.  If you buy the extra $9.99 packs to go along with the app you‚Äôll have plenty of variety.  Great for your core as well since there‚Äôs lots of squatting integrated into the exercises.  The music is also designed to provide a rhythm to get into during the sessions.
3202,sCyand,"Jun 13, 2020 at 11:58 PM",5,Love this game! add some kicks??,"Since my boxing class at the YMCA was cancelled, I‚Äôve been pining for something like this! So much fun, and great exercise. The beat really helps with some of the more complicated combinations. While a lot of workouts use the same elements, there are enough variations to keep it interesting. I would love to be able to see (within the game) which workouts have squats/dodges, rather than having to look it up on the website. I look forward to some new tunes and fresh workouts. Most of all, I can‚Äôt wait to see how they can incorporate some kicking in future releases! So glad I found this game!!"

3204,RenardDee,"Jun 20, 2020 at 2:41 AM",4,Great until it‚Äôs glitchy,"Love the concept. Almost forget I‚Äôm doing squats when I‚Äôm playing. I wish I could rate workouts or favorite trainers:workouts. When you hit play you really only know the length of time not how challenging or heart rate raising it will be.

And then it glitches. It seems to freak itself out when the beat drops and there are a dozen shapes coming at you. It often pauses - sometimes short sometimes long enough to make me miss several punches. 

I also can‚Äôt get out of the adjust gloves area. I have to quit to get out even though it says to hit the nonexistent menu (all the buttons adjust your gloves more).

Today the screen filled with black squares and I could only see the floor and hear the music."
3205,SpyderCandy,"Jun 26, 2020 at 11:22 PM",5,Great for at home cardio work out!,I sweat in this game! Would be cool to be able to see other players avatar somehow & punch in groups! Need different levels in the shorter mins. This is a great app & helpful during quarantine right now.
3206,Han,"Jul 8, 2020 at 5:15 AM",3,Good Fitness APP Bad Game,"I own both the Oculus Version and Steam Version. As a fitness program, it is 4.5/5, but as a game, it is 2/5. The tracking problems are too often, the biggest issue is lost track, and sometimes I can see myself clearly hit the target but it pass through. For a fitness program, this might be OK, as long as the user keeps workout. But for a game, these bad experiences are frustrating."
3207,Breakfast_Sandwiches,"Jul 8, 2020 at 12:16 AM",3,It at least gets you moving,"I got this game during quarantine to get me up and moving. It‚Äôs a fairly fun game, similar to Beatsaber in that it‚Äôs a rhythm game that rewards you for hitting all the things, except it‚Äôs not trying to trick you. But the thing is, it‚Äôs not very hard at all. Unless there‚Äôs a bunch of squats, I barely break a sweat and find myself getting bored more often than not. I am not a very active person, I walk a fair amount in my job but other than that not a whole lot going on. I was hoping for something more physical and fast-paced, and I wish there was a filter to find those faster songs I‚Äôm looking for. So it‚Äôll get you moving, which is never a bad thing, but maybe skip if you‚Äôre looking for more."

I‚Äôm a newer user so could be just me."
3220,Oculus-Max,"Jun 27, 2020 at 9:40 PM",3,Great game but some issues it has,"This is now my go to game for fitness. Lots of great stuff happening here and a few things I would love to see added or fixed to make this a 4 or 5 star game. As is now I have given it a 3 star rating and here‚Äôs why:

No option for custom music. Quite a few of the songs are just not my style and are painful to listen to. The techno grunge poppy stuff is just cringe worthy. 

It would be great if you can favorite the sessions you complete for the first time so that you can go back to them. But it‚Äôs currently not an opinion. 

The guard color should be different than the color of the right hand punches. No reason why it isn‚Äôt. 

With a full battery in the touch controllers sometimes the gloves losing tracking even with a well lit room. 

First issue I had in the game was that it put me at the edge of my guardian putting me right up on the wall. No option to reset this. So you have to exit the game and readjust your position. 

Some of the combos don‚Äôt make sense, like the quick ‚Äúdouble jabs‚Äù. They don‚Äôt seem to make sense and just add to the aerobics element to it. It feels more like a cat double jab lol. 

Again with the music, there should be a room solely for hip hop. It‚Äôs my biggest gripe so far with the game. 

Other than those things I still enjoy the works out because some of them are really great. Unfortunately you can‚Äôt favorite them after playing them. Sorely overlooked option. 

3 out of 5 stars means it‚Äôs still good, just some key missed opportunities to make this game truly great. 

I‚Äôve put in two hour long sessions into the game and fortunately haven‚Äôt encountered any crashes."
3221,Likes2LOL,"May 19, 2020 at 11:34 PM",5,Very fun but..,Love the game. It‚Äôs one of top plays. The other reviews are correct though. There needs to be an intensity mode.

3223,duke1976,"May 18, 2020 at 8:25 PM",5,Playing every single day 1-2hrs,This is a great cardio workout. Have compared it to running and the calories burned are higher and it doesn‚Äôt impact on the joints. Shadow boxing and if you get bored just turn the music off and put ur own one in the background. Also you can add wrist weights to make it even tougher after a while !

I find it difficult to stay focused in a gym, hate running, and swimming is great for the core, but isn‚Äôt quite intense enough to get trim without devoting a ton of time to it.

This is it!!! Quick, intense and most importantly fun, keeping you focused so you can forget your working your backside off (cos you really are). I actually look forward to it!

I started small with 2 and 7 minute workouts just to get the hang of things. I already had a hefty sweat just after that! 

Suggestions for Devs: First off, amazing job! I would love to see The Quest able to incorporate our own music somehow though, or if y‚Äôall could bring in some well known songs into the playlists. Also, a few more than the three available rooms would be a nice addition. 

Overall, hands down the best VR Workout experience I‚Äôve had to date, and it‚Äôs definitely worth the money. I highly recommend!"
3228,MarcusTheCarcass,"Jul 2, 2020 at 3:31 AM",3,I want to love this game but...,"Update.  I originally gave this 1 star because it didn't work correctly and support STILL has not returned my emails.  I am guessing they did an update  to the game because it started working.  Still only giving it 3 stars because: Support is still bad.  I find it funny that they respond to my review with a ""please reach out to us"" when my review is mostly around ""I reached out to you and you wont respond"".  Also only giving 3 stars because the workout is not intense enough. Not happy about spending $10 extra and still not having an intense enough workout.  They need to add more motions, heck you have 360 degrees so use it.

Original Review:
I really want to love this game, and overall it is enjoyable. You can get a  workout when you pick the right workouts.  I agree with what another person stated, the $10 extreme add-on should have offered a free trial because it wasn't worth the extra money.

My BUT... is around support.   I don't like companies that sell you a product but don't offer any sort of valuable support. We are having issues with the game freezing and some game play issues. I have reached out to support twice but no response.   This game has the potential to be a 4 or even 5 star game BUT lack of support is always a 1 star product in my mind.  With a few enhancements and SUPPORT this game could be one of the best.  My advice, buyer beware.  If you don't have any problems you could love this game BUT if you have an issue, don't expect anyone to get back to you with help."

3230,Thomas,"May 24, 2020 at 5:34 PM",5,I'm Impressed!,"Box VR was not fully what I was thinking.  I feared if I bought it, I was going to have to ask for a refund. Except that's not how it went down. 

After trying it. I can honestly say... 
Box VR exceeded my expectations and on top of that, there's no subscription!

I will be more than happy now to buy extended DLC packs later on. To support this team farther as well as adding additional content for myself. 

VR Boxing also has a great boxing feel about it. I believe you to will be amazed!

I won't be refunding."
3231,Al,"Jun 22, 2020 at 4:06 AM",1,Beat Saber is 1000 times better.,"I‚Äôve been playing Beat Saber as my morning cardio with wrist weights and it has been great. I would play each track on 120 speed twice, once right handed then play it again left handed. I would play for an hour or two and wear my garmin HR chest strap and burn at least 600 calories. I‚Äôm a 33 year old male and 175lb. I purchased this game as a variant to go back and forth between it and Beat Saber just so I wont get bored from playing Beat Saber because I LOVE IT! I played Box Vr for few minutes and realized that this was a mistake. It‚Äôs SUPER   S L O W   on the hardest modes. I watched my heart rate and calories and I was burning as much calories as if I was warming up my rotator cuffs. It‚Äôs a horrible game to label as ‚Äúfitness‚Äù game. Buy this game if you want to stand up like an idiot and and throw one punch every 2 seconds, and if you want to gain weight. It needs a lot of work, and I believe there is room for improvements, just get the help of a REAL boxing coach, make it faster, and add more options. Also the gloves adjustment setting... it needs an option to restore original place."

3236,CurtyBob,"May 8, 2020 at 11:51 PM",3,"Nice for cardio, terrible as a game","Like the title says, this app is great at directing you in a cardio simulation.  If you are someone who cares about combo's or scores though, this is not for you.  One of the major downfalls for me is 90% of my lean movements are not registered.  I've even gone as far as step away from the lean prompt completely to see if it still says it hits me; it does.  This just destroys a 200 hit combo and makes me infuriated with the workout, and working out angry because something you purchased doesn't work properly really sucks.  

Another thing that happens way too often (at least once every workout) is I'll get a bug that makes my glove fly off into the level and then have to mash the oculus button.  Or the screen will freeze and kick me to my home screen., making me start an hour workout all over again.  And another bug happens whenever you try to pause the game.  If you pause in the middle of a workout, the game will more often than not just keep going with a pause menu in your face and the only way to fix it is to restart your quest.  

To me, these few glitches are game breakers and make the whole experience less than enjoyable.  I would understand if it were a free app, but I paid money for this.  I have at least a dozen games on the quest and a high speed internet connection (100 mbs) and this is the only game where I have these problems.  If it wasn't for the bugs, this could be an enjoyable workout app.  Hopefully it can be fixed with an update."

After a year I decided to try it again and I'm glad I did, it's now my favorite workout on the quest! So much fun. If I had one complaint it would be the ""bonus up"" sound seems to be the same sound as the ""missed hit"" sound so it can make you think you've missed a punch.

I go to the gym and since all of them have closed I‚Äôve been playing a lot of vr. I tried a lot of games and refunded because they all do the same thing for me play it for a little and get boring. I saw this game and said why not. It is a good workout but I bet if you have weights (1-2 pounds maybe) it would make it even better.
3243,Deuce Loosely,"May 13, 2020 at 1:13 AM",4,"Good workout, keeps me interested!","I'm a pretty average guy with a dad bod. Never really needed to exercise when I was younger, but as I near 40 things are slowing down. I decided to give this app a try as it seemed to be more of a workout app than a game like many others.

This app will make you sweat! You get out of it what you put in, so if you really punch and squat you will burn calories and feel the burn for sure.  Most importantly, it is fun! Maybe all the songs aren't top 20 hits, but they fit the groove well and I often find myself humming along as I jab and slip. 

My wife (who takes much better care of herself than I do) also gave it a shot and has been making it a part of her routine. You can create more than one profile to track your own usage, which is perfect for a couple or family looking to live healthier. 

Initially I ran into a few bugs that based on other reviews appeared to be related to a recent Oculus update (random black screen, lag, freezing). I contacted support and they replied within 24 hours stating that the fixed would be released that night. As promised the patch dropped and my issues were resolved. 

I recommend this app to anyone looking for a decent workout app on the Quest. It also includes Cross buy. So if you have a Rift or Link cable (or Virtual Desktop) you also get the higher-res desktop version included!"

Can we really compare some in house studio instrumental guitar track to many popular 90's rap and rock tracks? Just saying a subscription that opens familiar tracks should be an option. Supernatural is overpriced, but the music is SO MUCH BETTER! I know workout music is important to MOST people."

Some workouts will have no music for a portion of the game, then the workout continues for a period of time even after the workout timer hits zero. Not enough customization options for colors of the gloves and block. The right glove and the block are the same color?! The sound of hitting 50 streak is the same as the sound of missing a punch?! No option to save high scores for multiple local users. No real way to compete for high scores within a household. This game is a good start, but needs lots of polish."

I think the UI is a little clunky and the mechanism for building your own playlist is frustrating. I can‚Äôt get the song preview to work in the playlist editor. My biggest problem with Box VR is that it crashes  a lot. Multiple times I‚Äôve had it glitch, or crash, or outright lock up my Oculus Quest. That really kills the momentum of your workout. If they could fix that I would rate it 4 stars. 

Some things I wish they would add though are the ability to load your own songs on the Quest, additional venues, intensity indicators and options for each song, and the ability to turn off obstacles for all workouts."

PROBLEM:  App crashes mid-workout, usually on the longer sessions (above 20-25 minutes) and usually around halfway to nearly complete.  This means 20-30 minutes into a workout, the app crashes before the workout is complete and the player loses total time and calorie data, in addition to not being able to get on the scoreboard as the session was incomplete.  This also means that any custom-created daily goals (a feature offered within the app) cannot be achieved in-game because the workout is incomplete.  This is frustrating and disappointing as the app is amazing and provides a lot of great workout sessions.

3261,Simone,"May 24, 2020 at 6:59 PM",1,Used to be great,"This is unfortunately what happens when you have no competitors out there. If you take a look at the available content for working out this is pretty much the only app that comes up, the rest of the content is just games. 

When it was firstly released the app used to be great, and you would expect that the app would improve with time to keep people engaged. Instead with no competitors what we end up with is less features than when it was firstly released, no improvements and more bugs than ever before.

Since a few weeks now the app runs horribly and it's full of bugs. Aside from the usual crashes mid workout, I get hands freezing in the air (controllers fully charged), pausing the app by pressing the home button doesn't pause the workout (I get back in the app and the workout is running while I see the pause menu).

Times pass and no additional features get added. What about more environments? What about letting us start workouts from any minute and second we want? What about using our own songs like on PC? What about letting people make their own workouts with an editor? What about custom punching targets? What about abs focused or legs focused workouts? What about more filtering options in the menu? What about previewing a sample of the songs of the workout?

So much could be done to make this great but again with no competitors no one cares and instead we get barely valuable DLCs."

I track calories burned on my Apple Watch and there are few workouts that I can do that burn as many calories per minute as this one.

I would be giving this a full 5 star but these features are on my wish list:

-Hand tracking support
-Song title and artist visibility in HUD while playing
-Ability to create a multiplayer session over a LOCAL connection
-Ability to manually reorder songs on my workout
-Indication of which songs are part of new packs when creating workouts
-Indication of difficulty of songs when creating workouts (ie. Fate Flier and Trap Lord are way more difficult than most songs...I‚Äôd like to be able to identify these in the workout editor)

I also very much appreciate the diligent response from the FITVR support team that, when I raised issues with the game that were affecting my play, responded quickly and fixed them for all! This kind of attitude shows that our experience is important even after we have paid for the game. Thanks!"

3265,Emily,"Mar 1, 2020 at 10:07 PM",4,I like it but have some suggestions...,"It's a great workout. I tried this yesterday and am very sore today. Great music selection! 

Some improvements I'd like to see:

1. Multiplayer: I'd love to be able to see and talk to the other person during the workout. It's not as motivating/fun to just see their score vs. yours. It would also be nice to choose specific songs during multiplayer, not just workouts.

2. Workouts Descriptions: it would be helpful if each workout were ranked by difficultly and if there was a description  of what it consist of. For example, I was looking for a workout that involved a lot of squats specifically and there wasn't a way for me to find this. 

3. More moves/left and right movement: The moves consist of punching targets, swiping left and right to punch, uppercuts, dodging barriers, squats and blocks by crossing your arms. It's good but can get boring after some time so I'd like to see more variety in the movements. Also, it would be great if the game required you to physically move around the room more rather than staying in one place (maybe targets could came to your left and right requiring you to move left and right to reach them). There could be some more uniquely shaped barriers to avoid (im thinking like in pistol whip where you have to duck and dodge walls coming at you). I just feel being required to move around the room would result in a better workout."

3276,Fergus,"Jun 7, 2020 at 8:37 PM",3,"great excercise, serious bugs on quest","this app would be great as a casual fitness game but major downside is its technical quality (on quest). Its crashing - specially if you pause the game and quit to quest home, you will most probably not be able to return and continue.  After some time of playing sine more intense workouts it starts to lag and will crash eventually. 
One minor thing - if you cant finish your excercise for any reason - eg you quit or loose power, you will loose all excercise progress. and it sucks to see your daily progress at 0 after hour of playing. 
also after successful finish of excercise it plays same sound which you can hear when you miss target during gameplay, not really motivating. 
Do yea- if you keep your excercise under 30mins, don‚Äôt pause and don‚Äôt play the most hardcore levels, its fun, its great and really makes you workout."
3277,Alex,"Jun 12, 2020 at 4:40 AM",3,Mediocre mashup,"This game tries to be boxing with beatsaber, but falls short on both. Beatsaber is fun, this game is a bit more precise where latency becomes a problem feeling like you are just making disconnected anticipations to succeed. Nowhere near as satisfying to use your fists over sabers either, obviously, but it is more work out oriented than fun oriented. If you are looking for boxing go with thrill of the fight. Boxvr has me falling into weird habits and motions, TOTF definitely has mechanics that promote better posture and reactive motion. If you want something with a bit of both and don‚Äôt intend to eventually get both, go for it, but my opinion is these concepts are better done separately. If you are looking for a fun workout like I was when I bought this and like superhot or gunplay, forget the rest and pick up pistol whip. 3 stars because it is actually pretty well made and maintained for what it is."

I just want to make a suggestion/request. As a person who isn‚Äôt super educated about exercising I think it would be beneficial to have something like a model in the tutorial. I‚Äôd like something that shows you how you should move your body, or the best way to do so (for instance how to stand before,during,after each type of hit and how to twist to dodge.) 
Now I know that you can just do it how it feels best, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing so far after all. But if possible it would be great to have some guide.

This game WILL lock up on you at some point, and will do so more than once, often in the middle of the workout. Also, don‚Äôt put too much stock in a streak or the score: it will glitch and ruin your steak, and how it assigns points seems fairly arbitrary. 

Still, for moving and burning calories, I still use it everyday. I just wish it didn‚Äôt crash so frequently.

My only request is that there are indications for difficulty level, and also a bug where pausing the workout does not stop the colored spheres from coming at you. I'll often want to scratch an itch or readjust my position and stance, so I press the pause button, and sometimes it works, but other times it doesn't, and the pause menu comes up but the music and spheres keep moving. Really messes up my momentum."

But...,"Love the game but whenever you take the quest headset off for a bit and put it back on the game will freeze and or crash whenever you choose another song. Also if you pause the game in-between songs, the pause is ignored and the game will continue. The pause button only works if the song is playing. When you unpause the game, there isn't a heads-up or some feature that will give you a second to get back in the rhythm."

3298,MadalynnL,"May 13, 2020 at 9:54 PM",4,Great quarantine workout but i suggest..,"I read through some of the reviews and I think most of my points have been addressed but as someone who has worked for a digital gaming company compiling reviews I know sometimes developers need to hear it from a few sources. 

1. I agree the streak sound and the ‚Äúmiss‚Äù sound are almost identical and it took me a few weeks to figure that out. 

2. I would love more dojo options. New worlds are created daily in other vr games so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a crazy request. 

3. I burn the most calories in workouts where I‚Äôm giving to the music and not everyone‚Äôs style is the same. Why not let people add in their own music. Side note- I would pay for a pack that had pop music or actual songs. 

4. Can we please create some kind of leaderboard for Interactivity. Each punch gets points but from someone with no boxing background I‚Äôm curious how I stack up to others or what I could do to improve my form. Points are useless without a good benchmark. 

All in all though, for a video game to make you move and sweat is amazing and sometimes I even do these workouts outside."
3299,Sybil,"May 29, 2020 at 1:42 AM",4,Great Workout,"I really like this game.  However, there are far too many tracking issues wherein contact with the orbs don't register or the gloves are not properly displayed.  At times, the gloves disappear from sight.  It happens while all of the batteries are properly charged, the cameras are all clear and I am within the boundary.  I don't let that bother me because I use the game as exercise, not to obtain high scores."

Original review: I really do love this game, I use my quest mainly for fitness and this is my go-to every single time. Honestly, you should buy this if you're a quest user. Why 3 stars though... its reliability sucks. You just don't know if an exercise will lock up or skip/jump when you're in it. First 15 minutes you're usually ok but after that its hit or miss. Oddly it mainly happens when I'm finally getting a good streak of hits. Last night 1350 straight hits then it glitches and I go back to zero. Today 1500 boom black squares all over the screen, back to zero. I love it when it works but im getting thoroughly annoyed with it now. I've just dropped out of a routine because I hadn't missed a single item since the start and then bang it goes. Love the game, just don't expect it to work reliably."

3307,magnificentmel,"Apr 9, 2020 at 4:51 AM",4,The pump you‚Äôve been waiting for,"From head to toe you will be DRENCHED. I‚Äôve played for almost a week straight and I am so satisfied with my workout. Warning: you will be incredibly sore after your first 60 minutes if you are not conditioned. It‚Äôs intense and doesn‚Äôt feel like you are working out at all. There are many workouts to choose from. I love the daily workout option and how it tracks my progress. I appreciate that I can add another profile. The songs are enjoyable to box to. An overall quality game for anyone looking to get their mojo back into working out. 

Some suggestions: 

1. Would love more color combos for the gloves and a new arena to play in. 

2. A free play area! A punching bag you can utilize. Sections of the bag light up and you have to hit it accordingly. 

3. When the rings fill up during a workout it would be cool to see something stimulating that represents you‚Äôre at a high streak. It will keep the momentum of the player and will feel less likely to slow down in the middle of a 60 minute workout. 

4. Implement movement rather than a steady stationary stance. 

5. A REAL PAUSE BUTTON. I was 30 minutes into a 60 minute workout, had to pause the game and was forced to start over. I was less inclined to try again. 

I will re-review in a month or so! Highly recommend as of now! Keep up the updates! It‚Äôs fantastic thus far!"

3314,Hututu,"Jun 7, 2020 at 9:45 PM",5,Love this game,This game has become our family‚Äôs favorite workout activity! Love it and think it is better than beat saber.
3315,Ceottaki,"Apr 2, 2020 at 2:17 PM",5,I can't believe it actually works!!!,"I have a history of failing to go to the gym after the first month or so, and of failing to do any workout at home. I love the outdoors and my only successful consistent workouts have been with things I can do outdoors, such as running, mountain biking, hiking, etc.. Unfortunately, I live in a place where for at least 4 months/year, doing things outdoors becomes hard because of the weather, but in general I coped with that. Only now, at the very start of Spring, we have to avoid the outdoors because of this virus outbreak.

So I turned to BoxVR, having bought an Oculus Quest specifically for the purpose of attempting one more time to workout from home and hoping I wouldn't fail, but I was sceptical, thinking this may turn out to be as boring as everything else I had tried in the past or it wouldn't be a proper workout. Oh boy, how pleasantly surprised I was to find I was wrong!

BoxVR is really fun! I have been doing 30 minutes a day and I wish I had time for more. Not all of the music is good, but that's fine, it still feels like a fun ""game"", although it isn't really a game, and the workout is actually great, my arms and legs are sore as they should be and I expect I will start feeling stronger as time passes (I've been doing this for almost 1 week now).

The things I wish were better: I wish I had more virtual environments to work out from, and I wish there were more songs. But most of all: I wish I didn't have to restart a workout if I've paused. I've had to pause because of a phone ringing, or because my toddler walked into the room, or because I wanted to readjust the headset, and the game does not let you get back to the same workout. I guess is so you don't have an unplanned rest, to make the workout more effective, but the reality of life is that pausing will sometimes be necessary and it is really annoying that you can't carry on from the same place you were before."

3318,Sharon T,"Apr 25, 2020 at 9:52 PM",5,Love it!,"This is one of my favorite apps on my VR headset.  I have never been so active and now, look forward to working out each day.  Lots of songs to select from, daily workouts, professional trainer created workouts as well as additional workout packs that players can buy to ramp up their workouts.  Buy this one people."
3319,AKCobra,"Apr 25, 2020 at 10:09 PM",5,Great Workout,"I really wanted to give this 5 stars, but there are a couple of negatives that are big enough that I had to take a point off.  First the positives.  This game is probably one of the best workout games on the Quest.  It was obviously designed with that in mind.  That's good and bad, because while it's definitely more of a workout, its not as much fun as Beat Saber which is it's closest comparison.  With Beat Saber I'll go play it just for fun and get a decent workout in the process, where as I tend to treat BoxVR as more of a traditional workout where I set aside some time for it.  

Another big positive is that it's cross buy, so if you've got a PC that can handle it you can run the PC version via Oculus Link.  This is a pretty big deal with this game as it turns out, because adding in your own songs only seems to be supported on the PC version, which leads me to my first big negative, no custom songs on the quest.

A big negative (for me) is that I really don't like the included music at all, and no custom songs on the Quest.  I know music is subjective, but the included music is just not to my taste.  I get that the quest might not have enough horsepower to generate the maps, but why not at least let us port them over from the PC generated ones.

Lastly, and this is really more for the PC version, there should be more options for map generation for custom songs.  At the very least give us an option for no squats.  I have bad knees and the squats give me problems.  

Summary:
Pros:
Great Workout
Cross Buy
Custom Music (PC Version Only)

Cons:
Music (YMMV)
No custom songs on Quest
Not as fun as other rhythm games
Need more options for generating custom maps (PC version)


Bottom Line:  If you're looking for a great workout, get it.  If you just want to play for fun there are better choices.

Update:

I hadn't really poked around into all of the included music when I wrote this and some of my comments were based on the music in the pre-defined workouts, which I don't like at all. However it turns out there is a pretty generous amount of additional music available from different genres. I still prefer my own music though and use this pretty much exclusively on the PC version with virtual desktop so I can play my own music, but I don't think my initial review was fair so I'm bumping it up to 5 stars."

The only fix I've found is to uninstall a d reinstall the game, and then I lose all my progress. This has happened twice so far since I got this game.
Second, since this is more of a workout than a game it feels too utilitarian. You only have 3 environments to practice in and two styles of gloves. It would be nice to have more options. 
But the rest of the game is so good I'm still giving 4 stars. This is an amazing workout. Just after a week of doing this about 30 minutes a day I feel so good. It feels easier to move around, and I feel stronger."

 After a few tries I realised that you really have to throw some power into your punches to get a sweat on! but once you get the technique down its great! 

Would have given it 5 stars but it should really have difficulty ratings or even user ratings for workouts. Nothing more annoying that getting 5 minutes into a workout and realising its not very good. 

Also a clock in game would be great as I can get carried away and end up rushing to work! üòÅ"

Having said that, when it come to the music... It just isn't for me. I'm a hard rock guy and the music to this game does absolutely nothing for me.

3332,Harcourt.Mudd,"May 5, 2020 at 6:34 PM",1,"No custom songs, bad hand tracking","This game does make me break a sweat and is okay enough to play for a workout.
That being said, the hit detection is off. I've tried adjusting the virtual gloves as recommended by other players on the forums but it still seems to miss some of the times I definitely had my punch there. 

My second complaint though is there is no ability to load a custom song. While apparently existing on other platforms with this feature, it's not here for the Quest yet. Would be 5 star game with custom song options that allowed you to create your own exercises.

Definitely not worth buying the DLC. App is already expensive and not worth the full price. Developers should fix their system before expecting players to shell out for DLC songs. This is why they don't have custom songs, to squeeze you for more money in their busted product.

Update - bought creed and thrill of the fight and haven't loaded this app since, much better workouts with a full boxing experience and working hit detection."

I get half way through and it completely stops working and takes me to the oculus home page. How about every time now that I block, it says I did not and takes my high score away?

3343,Philippe,"May 1, 2020 at 11:26 PM",4,Great fitness game on the questt,"This is one of the games that makes me sweat the most in VR. It's similar to beat saber in concept but more oriented toward fitness. The action of throwing punches expends much more energy that cutting cubes with a light saber. There are plenty of workouts to choose from and a large music collection. 
There is still a lot of room for improvement though. My biggest problem is the very limited choice of background locations. Give us some nice sceneries in nature!! Why be stuck in a virtual gym when you could give us any amazing virtual locations. Second, I want to have feedback as to how hard I am hitting the balls and get more points when I hit harder. This would encourage and reward working out harder. Also, I wish there was better FX when hitting a target, such as a satisfying explosion. And being able to vary the targets would be great too, replacing the colored balls with ennemies running at you for example."

This game is Fantastic Workout but beware does not show or teach correct technique on punching, blocking, dodging movement / stances that are required in Boxing. It is purely up to each person to self check which is great if you know how already. ...
Please add more variety especially Training areas. I suggest adding a boxing style arena gym,  or create goals to unlock a new levels that can change scenes ,add different shapes to hit / dodge. Also if you added a punching bag to practice on ... with power hits would be very helpful...

I am soooooo glad i did. I havent had the game too long today is day 6. Yesterday I had to have a day off as I was that addicted to it that my body was like  whooooaaaa man chill. 

You will sweat like a mo fo. You will love more or less every minute of this game and the best part is say you have set up a 30 minute session it will feel like 5 mins- that's how good it is. Have a towel handy and make sure you are constantly cleaning the face part of the vr because you will need to. Only one thing I dont like are the songs , they could be better. 

In other versions of the game the custom song feature is there on the quest it has been turned off for some reason- if that could be switched back on then boxing to my own tunes would be amazing.

Great game well worth the money"
3346,Rhamy,"May 20, 2020 at 2:00 AM",2,Fun but buggy,"I own this game on Quest, PSVR and have played the Rift version via oculus link. 

It's a fun rhythm based game that will have you work up quite a sweat the first few times you play it (or more depending on your fitness level). Previously I was using it for the days where I couldn't get to the gym, but with lockdown it's become a great way to get some exercise indoors.

The main issue I've had is crashes. The game image on screen will stop but the audio will continue and you'll have to restart the game. This has happened three times in a row about 30 minutes into a session. I would have said this was happening 2/10 times, but since the 'Extreme DLC' (it's far from extreme) came out I'd say it's about 6/10 sessions which is really quite poor.

I would not recommend buying this game until the bugs have been ironed out, but if and when they are it's well worth picking up if you're looking to get some exercise indoors."

3348,Bryson,"Apr 10, 2020 at 10:33 PM",1,BUYER BEWARE,"Just a warning:  I bought BoxVR when it first came out.  I just saw that Oculus had the ""Stay at Home Duo Pack including Raquel NX and BoxVR (including the new Essential Pack) for just $34.99.  I added it to my cart to see what would happen and it said it would cost me $14.99 since I had already purchased BoxVr.  I made the purchase but the Essential Pack for BoxVR did not load, only the Raquet NX. Unfortunately I will be applying for a refund since they cheated me out of the additional BoxVR songs.  :("
3349,Mistoph,"Apr 16, 2020 at 8:54 PM",5,Even better after last update!,"I'll start with the most important. I got this game to get into shape. Been playing it religiously every single night for the last 4 months and it has changed my life. I got to my target weight (-10 kg) in no time and since that it's been helping my tone my upper and lower body. I have clear muscle definition and combined with weight lifting gained strength and endurance.

In previous versions the sound and track were always out of sync slightly, which led me to mute all sound effects except the music. Couldn't get too locked to the music though since it would cause me to miss certain hits.

Latest update fixed this issue completely and it's a while new experience. The sounds of the hits match with the beats and you can really get into the groove.

Life changing. A bit boring at times due to variation in music quality. A must have for any fitness VR enthusiast."
3350,bhison,"Apr 29, 2020 at 5:09 PM",4,Calorie tracker is incredibly wrong,"I enjoy the game a lot more than beat sabre for many reasons, not least the much better soundtrack, but the calorie counter is incredibly misleading. I hardly broke a sweat for 30 mins and I was told I had done over 200kcal. If I use a treadmill on high incline 10km/h for 10 minutes I am streaming with sweat and it estimates about half of this. I found complaints about this on Steam from 2 years ago with the devs saying this would be remedied, yet here we are in 2020 with the same issue they knew about then. This leads me to believe that it is intentionally misleading to make people think the game is a better work out than it is. Pretty cheap move if you ask me... ü§®

Also I found that the sound was going out of sync on endless mode which is a cardinal sin for a rhythm game!"
3351,HappyGilmoreUK,"Apr 29, 2020 at 4:23 PM",4,It‚Äôs good when it‚Äôs working,This is a great workout and builds up some serious sweat. My only issue is that it would tend to stick and not run smoothly if the game was paused for whatever reason. My quest is a month old so I know the issue isn‚Äôt on my end. If you‚Äôre going into the session make sure you plan on playing continuously from start to finish without going back to the home screen for any reason or taking the headset off for a few seconds as this will seriously disrupt the game and make it unplayable or crash it.

I loooove this fitness app one of my all time favs on my Oculas but the crashes... pretty much what a bunch of other reviews have said regarding crashing. I have spent just over three hours playing and have had five major crashes in that time. Three I could quit out of the and reload. Fourth needed to hard reset my Oculas and fifth just happened then after I attempted my first 30 min + workout with 58 seconds to go!!!!! This is the crash which made me write this review. So annoyed !!!!

Seperate to this I get the won‚Äôt load crash people describe. No music in the locker room means it just won‚Äôt load a work out, screen just goes black. 

Love this title and will change my review if this gets sorted. People have made great suggestions for extra features but for the love of god, fix these crashes as this last experience, to get to the end of a long work out and have to crash out with less then a minute and not record your achievement as a result of the crash is completely unmotivating!! :(

Played again today. 49 min work out. Full crash at 30. Seriously. What the hell. I can bother with work outs past ten mins as there is more a chance it will crash then it won‚Äôt !!"

3356,sitka,"May 16, 2020 at 8:29 AM",3,Not connecting hits,"Disclaimer: I am horribly annoyingly picky, so devs read this with a grain of salt because almost everyone enjoys this game. That being said-

Two things that annoyed me:
1. The special moves with tracers have to be hit in a precise way. If you don‚Äôt hit it just right, you miss. Its extremely annoying to miss all these things that I am supposedly hitting. I wish there was a way to remove the specials and just give me a straightforward hitting experience.  I know, I know, it‚Äôs a BOXING game, I should expect to BOX. But the hit box seems so small that it takes away from the fun. If I had more patience, it would probably work fine.

2. There is no indication for a break. The music just goes silent and you‚Äôre just left sitting there without any ‚Äúrest‚Äù or ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù prompt.  Yeah, it‚Äôs a couple of seconds, but like I said, I‚Äôm unrealistically picky.


The music is pretty good. I like the background music in the lobby. The layout is very well done. The graphics are well designed. The calorie counter is my favorite thing. 

Right now I am on the fence about whether or not to keep this game."
3357,Ellie,"Apr 11, 2020 at 10:05 AM",3,"Great game, needs more love.","First off - this is a really good game, I come away sweating after a 20 minute session which is the exact aim so kudos for that developers. HOWEVER, speaking as a game designer and a human player, there are some quality of life features that I'm stunned weren't in for day 1 and still aren't in now.

Like I said a 20 minute session will leave me sweating - SOME 20 minute sessions. And I can't remember which ones unless I take off the headset and write the name down as I select it because there's no indication/ preview of what workout you're about to do (or have just completed). This is really frustrating especially as some of the workouts are pretty slow, just boxing, just squatting, or some other feature I'd love to know about beforehand.

Secondly, create your own workout is clunky. There's again no way of knowing what box style you're going to get - the only option you have is to put together different songs and hope it works out when you press play - leading to a lot of standing around throwing your fist up once every ten seconds.

Give us some song previews, give us scores and PBs, give us song difficulty rankings and show us what type of play it'll be - leg work, arm work, lots of movement.

As I said, great game, buy it if you want a workout, but don't expect to get something that feels like devs cared about it."

I would like some more intense short workouts and descriptions of each work out, especially showing squats/no-squats but overall it‚Äôs been a vital part of my weight loss that I enjoy so keeps me coming back.

3363,Bigg,"Apr 14, 2020 at 6:46 PM",5,"DLC is overpriced, otherwise love it","As others have said, this is less of a traditional game and more of a fitness app. I've been using BoxVR to work out 4-5 days every week and I really enjoy it - as someone who generally hates working out, I actually have fun with the workouts in this app and it's kept me motivated to work out consistently in a way I've never managed to do before.

I will say, however, I'm a bit disappointed with the Essentials DLC -for $10, you only get four new workouts. I really think the DLC should have had twice as many workouts - reusing the songs from the first four would've been fine, just re-arrange them differently. The base game already does this, so I don't know why they didn't do it for the DLC.

Regardless, I highly recommend BoxVR if you're looking for a fun way to stay fit indoors."
3364,Pu Koh,"May 14, 2020 at 4:46 PM",2,Not worth it. Very basic,"Didn‚Äôt mind the trial. But totally regret getting full game. 

The songs are of dubious quality and you also can‚Äôt calibrate the ‚Äòhit zone‚Äô so most of the time I have to punch earlier than the beat of the music. Super frustrating. 

And I feel they didn‚Äôt get a real person to test the ‚Äòpunch patterns‚Äô because some of them are really ridiculous especially of you have to punch off beat for it to register. 

I wish I knew the return policy was 14 days. Would definitely have asked for a refund."

The game is awesome but I read some critics that sometimes punches are not tracked correctly. I used to do boxing for some time and I can tell you that if you perform the punches the right way it works perfectly fine. 
I think just TUTORIAL IS NOT GOOD and too short. It should show you how exactly to move your arm and fist the correct way to do a good punch. 
TIP: Keep your fisted high all the time like you would protect your face from getting hits (that is what you learn in boxing). This way you see your colors all the time and you perform your punches even better. 
That is something that belongs also in the TUTORIAL."

3370,Haitianeagle,"May 17, 2020 at 3:04 AM",3,Needs a lot more polish,"For $30 I expected a game that works decently well and had a fair amount of polish to it. I know it's a workout first and a game second, but the game part still has to work well. Unfortunately I'm refunding this title after only less than an hour of play. Here's why:
- It's frozen and crashed twice now. Once by starting the first workout and the other when I selected settings in the UI.
- The hit registration is just awful feeling. I've tried moving forward, taking a step back, and adjusting gloves. Uppercuts and hooks barely felt good to pull off. I'd have no problem with this if it were just user error, but there's no videos or well made tutorials to show HOW to make the moves. Like a video would've sufficed at least. Compared to beat saber this feels unsatisfactory when trying to string together a streak. 
- There's only 3 workout maps which kinda sucks.
- The presentation of it all could definitely be better, like the orbs you strike, the block cues, etc all look very bare and don't give real good feedback. 

It's not all negative though, here's the positives:
- A lot of workouts available and calorie tracker. 
- The songs are fun to play to. 
- This game will definitely get you sweating A LOT and you'll feel great after a few sessions. Loved that aspect which is why I'm disappointed in the negatives. 

All in all, it definitely has a great concept and when it works it's great. But the polish isn't there for a $30 game. I definitely think as of right now it is worth it on sale."
3371,Robocor,"Mar 27, 2020 at 6:47 PM",5,Love this!!,"As others have said the aiming and timing of the punches takes a bit if getting used to. (Hint) adjust your gloves!!  Once you get into the swing of it (excuse the pun) you can get a really good work out. The best feature is choosing your own tracks from the fairly extensive list and doing your own work out accordingly. You get stats at the end of a session telling you scores accuracy etc. I would give it an unreserved recommendation. As it is it‚Äôs a very good fitness title.

The music made the session last SOOOO much longer. 95% of the music had a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre on the beach doing yoga‚Äù feel to it. I need to be pumped up with fast music with a nice beat. My request to the developers is at minimum to make it possible for us to either see the playlist in the session before choosing or to be able to select what kind of genre we would like to hear in the session. I came very close to quitting the session today because of the music.  I understand copyright laws and such but whyyyyy is every song electronic. That may motivate some people but we should at least be able to choose or see before getting stuck in a workout. I bought the essential pack as an option instead of making a playlist, with my own workout.  Now I feel like I‚Äôve made a mistake purchasing this if the music sucks."

3376,Vaybear,"May 8, 2020 at 2:18 AM",4,Throw in some Wing Chun for extra fun!,"I was initially disappointed that it didn't feel like 'proper' boxing. I would get tracking issues whenever I put my controllers too close to my chin. To avoid any disappearing gloves I had to keep my fists mostly around chest/nipple height.

This almost made me go for a refund, but after my very first session I realised how effective it was as exercise. I accepted that it's  not going to feel like real boxing, but then I discovered that it doesn't have to. I ended up bringing in different disciplines and it worked surprisingly well!

What do I mean? Well, for example if there are a string of left and right punches that aren't too fast, you can punch with a karate style. This is where your stance is more square and your off-hand returns to your hip area (to imagine this, picture what it looks like when Cobra Kai are doing their training sessions. Please tell me you've watched the amazing TV series).
If the punches come fast? Well you can live out your Ip Man fantasies because it's Wing Chun chain punching time!

Mixing it up like this has made it a lot more enjoyable for me. Now instead of feeling like the game is missing the real feel of boxing, I can mix and match my styles on the fly and enjoy the workout!

That's not to say it's devoid of any boxing principles. When the game makes you duck and weave to lead into an uppercut for example, it feels great.  

The music is a great mix of genres, there's probably something for everyone here and even if you don't like the music that much, the workout is fun enough to put up with it.

I gave this four stars because there are bugs. It seems like this game has been out a while so I'm shocked that bugs this serious exist in a game like this. The first bug happened in my first play session. The game started to choke up and dropped to 1 frame per ten seconds. I wrestled with the menus and finally exited the game and when I got to the Quest menu, it forced a shut down.
It also occasionally hangs up during a session so it will throw your timing off. Poor.


To summarise, if you like rhythm games and working out, you'll probably enjoy this."

3385,D-ROCK,"Apr 26, 2020 at 6:08 AM",3,(UPDATE) my first Oculus review,"(I changed my mind review from 5 to 3 stars. See why at bottom) 

I'm very impressed. It's honestly just as fun as beat saber but I get more out of it. I kept going back and forth on whether I should buy this game because it just seemed like a basic exercise thing but it's actually both fun and rewarding. So far I like the music options better than beat saber and I get more exercise. This just might be my favorite Oculus game so far. If not then it's really close to the top

Reason for lower rating:
MUSIC. While I like the music , you don't nearly have a large selection. It is extremely demotivating to hear the same music over and over again. Each music genre has about 6 songs. if someone only likes Hip Hop to exercise to, then they only have 6 songs to listen to. 6 song is enough for one workout so basically you would hear the same songs every single day. When you are not motivated, it's very difficult to want to exercise which defeats the whole purpose of the app. 

Suggestions:
1. Please allow us to preview music before choosing a class. When you click on a class, it should play a sample of the music. It's such a huge part of the exercise. When I start a class and don't like the music, I must keep searching and it gets annoying and time-consuming

2. Blocking could be improved. Blocking should come from front, left and right. As if a boxer was trying to hit you from all sides which is what would actually happen. This would cause you to twist your body left and right in the blocking position to work your core"
3386,kadejito,"May 8, 2020 at 10:00 AM",3,More like BoxWU (warm-up),"I really want to give this game five stars, but I feel there are several things that need to be improved:
1.) The songs and classes need to be clearly organized by difficulty.
2.) This game needs to be more challenging.  It allows you to create your own playlist (only from songs included) and lets you toggle the difficulty, but even on HARD many of the workouts are soft.  The Extreme pack that was released recently was a step in the right direction, but its not enough.
3.) More customization options.  More stages, more sprites, more sound effects.  That scoreboard also needs a major overhaul.
4.) Allow the player to create a playlist using songs from their own personal library.  That was the most frustrating thing when I first got this game for my Oculus Quesr, that you can only workout to songs already provided with the game.  Granted, some of the songs are very good, but this should have been an option from the get go.
5.) I wish this game could hook up to a heart monitor so that I could see how hard Im working.  Better still, so that the system could see how hard Im working and adjust its difficulty accordingly.

I feel this game has potential, but as it stands now, after about two weeks the game ceases to be challenging and becomes more of a warm-up tool for more challenging workouts.  After about a month, the stages and songs become tedious.  Game needs an overhaul"

3390,Paul,"May 7, 2020 at 11:20 AM",3,"Great idea, but tracking not good enough","This is a great idea, and fitness wise, it's fantastic. However, the game wants to base its scoring on combos and streaks, and the tracking simply isn't good enough to support this.

Multiple times now the game has said I've ""missed"" shots where the orb has just passed right through the glove despite a shot being made. At one point today it completely gave up tracking either glove until I re-centred the view.

For a game so reliant on accurate tracking, this definitely needs improvement."

Dev and Oculus blame each other....that does a LOT to fix the problem.

Needless to say, all the add-on packs are not an option until this is fixed.

It would be nice if:
- you could star favorite workouts
- workouts would have descriptions
- In like the option for the you can custom playlist chosen from the provided library but  the length of the workout is the playtime of the songs.  There is no way to set the time you would like to workout. 
- it would be nice if you could upload your own music or at least if there was an option for something heavier than rock
- there isn't a description of what the different sounds are.  I will be focused on playing and there will be a chime sound and I have no idea what it means"

I have one request to the devs. Can we have a ""full on level"" where the objects are coming at you from 360¬∞ instead of just the front which in turn forces you to move around. You would get such an intense workout then.  This game would then be even more better. 
Keep up the great work"

3399,Sidnuts,"Apr 16, 2020 at 4:42 PM",4,Great work out!,"OK, been using BoxVR for around 4 months around 3-4 times a week trying to get 45-60 mins for each work out.  Just using the BoxVR workouts I have definitely toned up and my heart rate has dropped too which is great. 

As others have mentioned, it really does need the type of intensity adding to each workout as going to https://fitxr.com/boxvr/workouts and checking the level of intensity and whether or the workout contains squats or not is a pain.

I also purchase the 1st DLC for BoxVR and I can definitely say I and not impressed, although does add 60 mins of new songs, it hasn't added enough workouts.  Really disapointed there were so little new workouts and no new 60 min workouts.  I have tried to create several 50-60 min workouts myself but its just not the same, they just don't flow the same (could be me though)

I would definitely recommend the base game, but cannot recommend the DLC as just doesn't add enough to justify the price.  But if they added a lot more workouts I would have been so happy with the additional DLC."

3406,TheBigDumb,"May 2, 2020 at 9:57 PM",3,Needs redesigning. Don‚Äôt buy addons,The original program is pretty good. They need to make it so you can easily adjust the difficulty of each workout. At their current levels they are all too easy and will not get you breathing hard. They should also make it so you can target different body regions. Like a leg routine that has a lot of squats. A core routine that has a lot of switching from side to side. An arm routine that is like using a speed bag.  That‚Äôs the way people workout. The new update music addons are insulting. One hour of new music (that you may or may not like- and by no real artists) with new workouts for $10. It doesn‚Äôt need new music. It needs several workouts of varying levels for the songs it has. They don‚Äôt need people to ‚Äúdesign‚Äù these workouts. An AI should be able to do this easily. I like BoxVR. It just could be so much better.
3407,Stuart Hands,"May 2, 2020 at 8:00 PM",2,"Great work out, but crashes a lot","I had high hopes for this app especially during this current climate (lockdown) and for improving my fitness. 

What I have experienced with this app it is a good cardio workout, however the app crashes a lot. 

I started out with 15 min sessions and these seem to work well but I felt I could do more so I started with 29min sessions. However I have only been able to complete 1 29min workout out of 10 workouts I have attempted. This is very off putting and I felt like I had not achieved anything, as I have nothing to show for my work out. 

FitXR have put this down to the Oculus Quest OS v15 upgrade and the release of the BoxVR Essentials pack. I am still pursuing a support ticket with FitXR so hopefully this can be resolved. 

As it is at the moment I would ask for a refund if I could but the refund policy stats I cannot have a refund, just hope they fix it quickly. 

If they can fix these crashes then it would go along way to being a great rhythm fitness app."
3408,MADMAXMARVIN,"Apr 28, 2020 at 6:08 PM",4,Great concept & workout,"I have found this to be a fantastic workout but it it could be improved upon in several ways:

Better selection of music (I find most of it a little dull).

Notification sounds are confusing as some sound the same as others.

Lobby is a very basic format.

Previewing songs takes too long and I have also found this to be buggy (had to restart Quest as it was unresponsive).

This game/workout could be so much better, one day it could be as good as / go up against Beat Saber but it isn't quite there yet.

Keep up the good work Dev's, and please provide me with some better / more encouraging music options!"

3413,alfrnat,"Apr 12, 2020 at 7:56 PM",4,My fav on quest!,"I love this game; however, I have a few suggestions that would make the game for me much more user friendly. 

1. I would like to bring my friend from oculus party into the game with me, to be able to continue chatting in between the songs, I think that would be more fun, no need to have that for random multiplayer but if you're with your friend I think it would be fun to feel like you're training together, would be great to see them in vr as well. 

2. I would love to see all my high scores for each of the songs, maybe even by date so I can track my improvements. Improve your scoring statistics overall

3. Detailed descriptions that are posted on your website/difficulty levels etc in the vr so I don't have to look it up on my phone every time. 

4. Ability to add the song to favorites during the breaks between songs in the training session to be added to custom list including the set choreography. Sometimes I love the song but it's hard to pause/take off the headset, write the song down.

I did a half hour custom workout and the choreography was repetitive and off beat. I didn't enjoy it at all, same with your survival mode, I felt like it was lagging.

5. When I play multiplayer it shows my husband's photo as we're using his account. Would be nice if instead of the oculus account boxvr could show the additional account nicknames/photo show up in the multiplayer game

6. More detailed tutorial, descriptions and strategies of how the scoring system works and best way to adjust the gloves, as the position affects the score. 

7. Calorie count based on body measurements like Fitbit or myfitnesspal. 

8. Collaboration with Fitbit. It doesn't seem like I burn nearly as much calories in the app as I do according to my fitness watch... 

9. New environments

not urgent but would be nice

some new color schemes/shapes, somehow to see the scores of each hit. Maybe a slow practice mode so we can figure out how to hit to get the highest score."
3414,Dillan,"Apr 13, 2020 at 7:26 AM",4,Great Exercise Game!,"I was first skeptical about getting this thinking there would only be a few levels that didn't even give you a real workout. However, after playing for a bit I realized there are a TON of levels packed with amazing songs including the new essentials pack that just released. This game is sure to get your heart pumping and get you going. You can even choose categories depending on how long you want to workout. I've been playing an hour a day and I already feel so much better. The only problem is sometimes the game lags for a second and that can really take you out of the experience 9/10"
3415,Ofbrun,"Apr 28, 2020 at 6:03 AM",4,Fantastic Workout With Minor Issues,"So I play this game quite a bit and have been using it as a workout. It‚Äôs honestly fun, and it‚Äôll get you sweating. 

The music is good. It has a variety of tracks. I prefer rock music, and they have a decent library. They also divvy it up by genre. Previewing songs doesn‚Äôt work though, which is weird. 

Gameplay, is simple. Punch the correct punch at the correct time. Dodge and block when appropriate. All to a rhythm. It‚Äôs fun and it works. The only issue is that the tracking can occasionally mess up. This is a fast game, and you move very quickly. Sometimes, I throw a punch and it doesn‚Äôt register. It might just be a quest limitation, or might have to do with the room/lighting I‚Äôm using, as some days it seems better than others.

Overall though, it‚Äôs a minor complaint. This game is fun and a great workout."
3416,Shakardi,"Apr 27, 2020 at 11:41 AM",4,Game is glitchy but still good workout,"If you don‚Äôt focus on trying to ‚Äòbeat the game‚Äô, then it‚Äôs a really good workout. 
There are some of the songs that feel broken. On some of them the dodge left is impossible (trust me I‚Äôve almost thrown myself on the floor to dodge them). In some classes one of the songs might lack the music, but then it‚Äôll play the music when the class should be over, and then extend the class with 30-90 secs after we reached 0 on the countdown. Others just feels like an intern gave up on making the ‚Äòbags‚Äô follow the rhythm.
And the pause menu doesn‚Äôt always pause the game üòÖ

The majority of the classes are good though. I‚Äôve gotten plenty of 1500+ streaks. Buuut if you get one of the broken classes without knowing it might be a bit broken, then you will get really frustrated if all you want to do is beat your current high score ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

I sweat a lot but also really enjoy the programs. However, I get a lot of black screens and no loading of certain lessons etc. I have to reload the app multiple times until I can get somewhere sometimes. 

Another issue I have is, maybe it is just me related, but certain punches of uppercut don't register imo. 

Overall, fantastic core experience, some poor app optimisation. I would love to give it 5 stars. And I will change my review as soon as I stop having loading issues and black screens. (literally the first day I could not get into the 'lesson of the day', I tried 6 times, I had to reboot the app)"
3420,Mahk,"Apr 27, 2020 at 8:10 AM",4,Very Good game that could be GREAT,"I am going to be a tiny bit critical because I REALLY like this game ALOT. It is  a phenomenal work out that, from a fitness standpoint, puts something like BeatSaber to shame. (In fact I use BeatSaber as my cooldown after BoxVR) Unlike the Rift version though on a Quest though they won't let you use your own songs. The programming is already there, port it over Please! The intense workouts are fantastic. I am down 15 pounds in 20 days just by slight changes to eating and using this 30 minutes a day. I would prefer fewer instances of repeated upper cuts from the same arm as they are awkward and unnatural feeling. Otherwise I highly recommend it. Totally worth the price!"
3421,Luolin,"Apr 27, 2020 at 2:59 AM",4,It is pretty good,"Ok, I am not an expert in cardio physics. I won‚Äôt write this review in impeccable English which will mean that whoever writes a legit review will make a few grammar and spelling mistakes. I get tired of seeing these canned and perfect reviews which are planted by the devs or their supporters. Please know that this is a review from me, not some person who writes a review to promote their product. 
I like the product. 
I am old so this should answer any questions you may have that comes up when you read my review. 
The music for the most part sucks. 
One song even promotes rape. It states something like I will take it even though it was not mine to take. Doesn‚Äôt anyone listen to the lyrics?
I do like some songs. Facebook doesn‚Äôt promote songs like what I stated above. I guess you have to be a social worker to recognize rape culture. 
I guess because I am old I am not use to this culture of sexual violence. I guess the younger is used to this. 
I like some some songs. 
I does give me a good workout. I hope that there is a more explicit explanation of what each song does for a workout. 
I have not bought DLC. I thought it was a group, a band. 
I don‚Äôt like computer generated songs. I have garage band. I know how to create songs and I don‚Äôt know anything about music. 
It‚Äôs ok to have bands or singers to create a song with the mapping. I would pay for it. 
Please create better workouts with better bands or singers. I will buy it.

3422,Stnbssr,"Apr 30, 2020 at 2:27 AM",3,Buggy as F*CK!,"Awesome workout, good music selection, lots of fun yadda yadda.. you can read all that in all the other reviews.

What I feel is not mentioned enough is how many BUGS this current version (30th April 2020) contains!
There are so many bugs with the targets just sometimes overlapping or changing position to where you actually are in the room (sometimes adjustable by long pressing the home button but not always). 
The awful tracking ruins the flow of the game enormously. If it wouldn't be so infuriating it might actually be funny when you lose your glove and it just keep flying off across the room when you're trying to hit something but sadly it does ruin the flow and just results in missing many targets that's not your fault but the games buggy code.
So better just pause the game - but oh wait often that just results in the pause screen popping up in front of the screen while the game is still continuing and more balls/hurdles are continuing to come at you.
Also if you wanna make your own Workout Playlist, plan an hour to do so because often loading to the music in the library to give it a listen to chose what you wanna pick might just take about 1min each, so bring a lot of patience or just go with the preset Workouts.
But if you have made your own Playlist, saved it and wanna open the game maybe on the next day you might be shocked about it not being there anymore, don't worry. It is - just restart the game and if the length is showing 0:00 just click on it and it'll show the actual length. Perfect.

Additional Note: This game would be perfect to use with bluetooth headphones (you can enable pairing those under your Quests All Settings > Experimental Features > Bluetooth Pairing) because cables are really annoying with that much movement but the sound of hitting the targets gets delayed so much that either you disable that sound or just go for the cable option, this isn't really the game devs fault but still - what I have also noticed is that the timing of the targets often doesn't even fit the music itself, that's a big difference to Beat Saber, so because making your own Playlist with the available music is such a pain in a*s anyway, I usually just put the Quest on silent and connect my wireless headphones to my phone and play music from there, this way you can also continue to listen to music and not have to wait a minute between the old track finishing and new track starting which also just destroys the flow for me every single time.

Overall SOO much potential, SOO many annoying bugs - this would be understandable if the game would be new but it's been out since June 2017 so really WTF?!"

After a few minutes of playing I started to notice that sometimes the game can have a hard time telling whether you hit the target or not (I missed quite a lot of hits because of that). I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs due to my sense of rythme as I‚Äôve been playing the drums for more than 10 years now (and I really succeed when playing Beat Saber haha).

These are things I need though.
For the love of all that is holy let‚Äôs me pause and continue with my workout!!!! I need to wipe my brow or change headbands ok!? Doing this should not shut my work out down just because I don‚Äôt want to sweat through onto my headset electronics.
(Update... I‚Äôm so dumb! Because there is no ‚Äúresume‚Äù  button I assumed I could not continue the workout but all you have to do is press the oculus button to resume! Duh I guess but I would still say put a resume button there so morons like me don‚Äôt slag the absence of a feature that is actually included?)

I would also like to see the name of the currently playing song in my heads up so if I like it I can customize my own workouts.

Workout descriptions (no squats etc) and intensity should be included also aside from the length and instructor in the main menu. Difficulty selection should be available for the same work outs.

3428,EauMan,"Apr 28, 2020 at 3:28 AM",4,Enjoyable & effective & I‚Äôm aching now!,"Before current restrictions I was training in the gym 4 times per week, consisting 2 upper body 2 lower body mostly free weight sessions & 1 or 2 cardio/mountain biking sessions per week. Struggling a little with motivation at home & having recently got a Quest I researched fitness apps & opted for BoxVR to get my heart rate up & maybe perform a little upper body exercise.  

I found the menu interface fine & easy to navigate & jumped straight in with a 30 minute workout. I also recorded the session on my Apple Watch.  The session was enjoyable & easy to follow though I struggled landing perfect upper cuts! Afterwards I was pleased to see that my workout had a average heart rate of 137bpm & a peak of 163, & that average is exactly where I want my cardio to be! 

Fast forward to the next day & my shoulders & upper back were aching, in places they hadn‚Äôt ached before, yet I was back in the app trying to perfect my upper cuts (which can take time)! Surprisingly I clocked up another 30 minutes of workouts without seemingly trying! Needless to say I am enjoying this app. 

My suggestions would be more workout environments (one outside at least), a better tutorial for nailing the upper cuts & heart rate monitor integration & maybe improved statistics on the new so you can track workouts/performance over time. But definitely recommended to get your heart rate pumping & some muscles aching!

** Update (2 days later) ** I have nailed the uppercuts now, whether it‚Äôs a timing issue or technique not sure but by my 3rd session I mostly hit them. As others have said it can be buggy. I turned off passthrough as if you accidentally turn on that during your session, your progress is lost, this is also the case if you go outside your play zone & passthrough appears both of which are annoying if your nearly at the end of a 30 minutes session. However I record the workouts on my Apple Watch so I can so see a more accurate calorie burn & heart rate. I bought the latest DLC which is ok but didn‚Äôt seem to provide much content. Still enjoying the game & it still makes me want to play/exercise longer than I‚Äôd planned.."

1:people said the hit boxes were bad 

When I first loaded up the game I thought this kind of review was right however after about 5 minutes I learned that the hitboxes were not bad the game is designed to make you think about how you were swinging your fist to keep people from flailing around like fools

2: people were complaining about the soundtrack

This one is quite simple if you don't like the soundtrack turn down the volume on your quest and turn on your own soundtrack. Duh

The bottom line is this boxvr is a fantastic workout tool that gets you up and moving with alot of options I would add this to any routine any day it is fun and thought out"
3435,Skruffy_Seff,"Mar 21, 2020 at 6:21 AM",1,Good attempt. But this game is crap.,"The calibration of this game is horrible.  It will not register an uppercut or hook unless you throw it really far from the body.  Sometimes it won'teven recognize a jab or cross even if I throw them correctly.  Sometimes the game continues if I pause it.  It takes me two to three times of starting a game then having to quit and restart it because it puts the area I need to stand in next or beyond my VR boundary.

3453,Vakuro,"Apr 8, 2020 at 6:18 PM",3,"Good work out, when it works","Overall: Great at keeping you active, but with a large caveat and a few minimal nags.


Actual problem!
In the two days I've had this game I've done just above 60 minutes of playtime each day (or at least of the time that registered). In that 2 + hour time, I've had the game experience a bug (at least 4 times, possibly triggered by head movement) in which the screen freezes then jerks around even after you stop moving, eventually freezing permanently and causing you to restart the game.  Being a game based on working out and playlists this is especially annoying because it doesn't always seem to track your time when the game does this and you have to start your playlist/lesson from the beginning or choose a new one. The frequency of this has entirely prevented me from attempting a 60 minute lesson all at once because I'm nearly sure it will happen in that time

 Given other reviews I'm seeing I wonder if this is only happening for me, but it hasn't happened with the other games I've played.

Minimal nag:
As a game, I feel like it handles more loose than I would like, or at the very least I'd like a bit more input as to what constitutes a hit and I want to feel some weight of the hit. Vibrations were on during one lesson, but oddly haven't been on since, maybe I'm missing a setting or it's at the discretion of the lesson creator. I typically end my lessons with above 90% in all aspects, but I don't understand some of the misses that occur, I see my fist go through the object so it seems it should be a hit. This can throw you off a bit, but doesn't really interfere with you being active. It is just annoying from a score perspective."

The only method of quitting a song is to close out the entire game. It‚Äôs a poor design feature that if you don‚Äôt like a song, or if your controller battery dies, you are stuck until the song ends or you quit the game.

I would also say the game does not track about half of the movements on my left hand as well. A number of times I will swing and it will not meet, but my right hand works just fine and has the same movement.

3461,Ilan,"Apr 20, 2020 at 3:25 PM",1,Good concept - poor execution,"Edit: changing my rating to one star. 

I find it annoying that developers release a minimalistic product and then focus on selling add-ons instead of fixing bugs and improving the app. 

This is what I think needs to be done to make this app awesome.:

1. Fix screen freeze bugs and crashes. 
2. More intensity: most lessons I‚Äôm barley moving. I find games like Pistol Whip much more physically intense. 
3. Add intensity indication: Lessons are categorized only by length. There‚Äôs no way to choose lessons by intensity. There is also no way to know the intensity of a lesson. 
It would be nice if there were difficulty levels per lesson (easy, hard). 
4. Terrible graphics for moving objects. The worst I‚Äôve seen in VR. Needs to improve. 
5. Colors of balls are similar. Problem for people with minor color blindness because you need to punch balls by colors. 
6. Add some visual feedback when hitting targets. Would be great if hitting harder will have different visual effect. 
7. Add some feedbacks when successfully hitting combos. 

Bottom line, please work on the basics before focusing on making fast money by selling add-ons. 
There‚Äôs lots to be done to make this app both fun and good for workouts."

But this game gives me a workout that makes the time fly so fast yet I break a sweat and get a great aerobic workout that has helped me lose 12 lbs in 1 month. of course, as soon as I started exercising, I decided I didn't want to eat like crap anymore so the combination of the exercise and eating better has contributed to My overall weight loss. But it all started with this wonderful game.
I have crappy ankles and arthritis so the normal types of activities like walking and running don't really work for me and I'm a terrible swimmer so this has been a real game changer for me. I'm a middle-aged woman and not a gamer so I really don't care about making any major strides or leaderboards, I just like having fun and getting the workout so this is perfect for me.

3467,Orange Hawkweed,"Apr 22, 2020 at 4:46 AM",2,Needs accessibility improvements,"I enjoy the workout related to this game but have to give it two stars as it does not allow the same level of access to content across abilities. The developers state that it's exercise for everyone so while they develop some boxing routines to have no squats, there are many sessions that have them with no option of removal. This does not provide those of use who cannot squat the same level of content that everyone else has paid for.

To improve access, would suggest:
1. Height adjustment option (this would allow people to duck rather than squat; also when sitting, the low punches tend to hit the knees...)
2. Remove squat option
3. Test with disabled users.

Emailed the devs a little over a week ago about this and will update if I hear anything.

Update: April 21, 2020. Devs got back to me and said they are looking to have these features in a future update. Fingers crossed."

I am giving this a 4 star from 1 now.   We finally got this app working again no thanks to support. I opened up a support case on Monday, it‚Äôs not Friday no response. It‚Äôs followed up earlier today too on the auto-reply, no response there either. 

This game is great for working out and really deserves a 5-star rating but due to lack of good support, I‚Äôm docking a star. 

The game broke after the last update so after a couple weeks of not being able to play it, I figured why not try to uninstall then reinstall. Voila, it works!

Previous review:

It‚Äôs been over a week I think since the last update. It‚Äôs now completely useless on Oculus Quest. This is my wife and I‚Äôs favorite game but since last update the game won‚Äôt start. You can select a work out, but once you select an environment it takes you to that environment and then greeted again with an environment selection. The game won‚Äôt start at all. I wrote support about this no answer there either. I want my money back if possible.  I think this game deserves a 5-star when it works again."

3476,Giancarlo Surla,"Apr 18, 2020 at 4:25 AM",3,Great App with Some Issues,"Update #2:  Although Box VR is still as solid a cardio workout as you can get on Quest, I have to dock it another star based on the DLC.  Considering how much they are charging, the included songs should not be generic stock music.  Beat Sabre in comparison includes top hits as part of their DLC.  The song quality would be forgivable if the workouts included anything new...but no additional functionality is included as part of the DLC.  
Update: After hearing from the devs regarding the ability to reset your position.  This makes the app so much more useable.   I've added an additional star.  Unfortunately there are some inherent issues with the hardware that make it difficult to track hands close to the head which is the proper form when you're in your fighting stance.  Not much the devs can do about this other than possibly provide a 'cooldown' in registering misses after the first one.  This makes it less frustrating when tracking goes wonky during a densly notetracked section.

Older Review: The PC version of this app is absolutely fantastic.  I'm a daily user and was excited to use this for Quest.  Unfortunately there were quite a few issues.
As mentioned by others, the tracking was pretty bad, but I believe the user can compensate for this.  The main issue for me is not being able to move my default position.  This is an issue for Quest where there isn't a canonical center...so I believe the user should be able to adjust this in the 'settings' menu.  I had one instance where the standing position was right at the edge of my guardian wall without any way to move this.  Along the same lines, the settings menu should also allow the user to set a height offset due to the iffy nature of the Quest calibration. 
Hopefully these issues get ironed out because the PC version is the best VR fitness app."

I‚Äôve enjoyed playing BoxVR for the past couple of days. It‚Äôs good for getting you moving and exercising your hand-eye and body coordination.

I‚Äôve not explored everything yet but;

It would be good to have a more detailed tutorial explaining what gets the best points per hit. 

A dedicated punch bag area would be a nice addition.

BoxVR lets me get lost in the music while I punch, jab and squat my way into better shape. I have played everyday since purchasing and will for the forsee able future. Jan 2020 BoxVR is doing a fitness challenge with daily spotlight classes. This is a great way to stay motivated and on track with a good cardio workout in your own home.

Edit: If you are having trouble hitting correctly, try adjusting your gloves in the settings. My husband who is a lifetime martial artist was hugely disappointed in this game because he kept missing, until he got the gloves right. When you adjust there are visible controller bands that you align with the gloves. Align the oculus symbol on the bands with where your inner wrist bone would be on the gloves. If done correctly, putting your hands up in the classic boxing position should look right in the VR world too."
3483,LeeAndo,"Apr 26, 2020 at 9:45 PM",2,From Vive to Quest,"This is now the second time I have bought BoxVR, I put in roughly 45 hours on my Vive version and so far after exactly one week since I bought the quest I have put in 3 hours.

BoxVR is easily my favorite VR experience for fitness and I have not grown bored.... and now with the quest I get to experience a quick start to the game as well as using it cordless which honestly makes a difference as having a cable previously is massively annoying when switching from left to right. Naturally this version visually is not as polished as its PC counterpart but that makes little to no difference.

The ONLY downside and this is the only reason I gave 4 rather than 5 stars, Is the  inability to add and play to my own music as is possible on the PC version... I crave this feature more than anything else, If they wanted to add some more environments that would be great as well.

PS: I have wacked myself in the head so many times doing the uppercut.... this is not a con of the game as much as it is my own stupidity and improper form.

UPDATE: Still love this game but I think adding DLC instead of the Custom Songs has more or less shown they have no intention of adding that feature, I'm not keen on the in-game music.

UPDATE: so I thought this was maybe a licensing issue but audioshield have found away to do it. Soooo any excuse there FitVR?"

There are no modifier settings, so you can't slow it down. The other two classes, under 9 minutes, are paced out more, and I don't get the sense of being overwhelmed. 

I tried a few more of the > 11-minute classes, and I faced the same frustration with the symbols coming way to fast to interact with.

3500,Pail,"Apr 16, 2020 at 8:23 AM",1,Decent workout but lacking polish,"Pros:
- Great workout: combination of jabs, hooks, uppercuts, block, dodge, and squats
- Wide variety of workout playlists and has simple (almost too simple) custom playlist

Cons:
- limited stages (3), very simple design. The futuristic one causes lag
- I‚Äôve experienced random crashes due to this game
- Custom playlist allows you to add a wide variety of music but the design is lack luster, simple preview system but no music player (just off/on)
- Glove adjustment is atrocious, difficult to align your controllers with the gloves, no default setting
- Haptic feedback is very weak, needs better visual cue
- Might be due to the poor glove adjustment but I found the tracking is hit and miss, I‚Äôve gone straight through targets without it registering
- Music sometimes stops in the middle of a playlist or ends before the level does

*reduced to 1 Star as it crashes all the time now. I suspects it‚Äôs caused by the music player when adding to a playlist"

3502,Dutchie70,"Mar 11, 2020 at 2:23 PM",5,A unique title and a great experience,"Hesitated because I recently bought a few other titles, but I am glad I bought this. 

Whilst I still think it is more expensive than most titles, I love doing this. 

It is not massively strenuous but still a nice enough workout made better with the beats and general choreography of the experience. 

They could improve the moves to make the ducking etc more strenuous. Am sure they will do more in V2.0 

Great one!"
3503,JophesSpreas,"Mar 3, 2020 at 3:03 AM",5,Fun Workout!,"This is a great VR game to get a great workout without realizing how long it's been.  I like the different length workouts available and the variety of punches.  Some improvements good be added. One might be adding in a 360 option to get your feet moving more. Also I'd love to see knees and kicks included but since those are tracked I understand that may be difficult.  But otherwise,  I enjoy using this almost daily now as a workout."

It is awesome, BUT, it crashes on me at least once a workout with no predictability, totally frustrating!!! I literally have a gigabyte (up and down) and the fastest router available - there should be nothing holding me back... So why? I agree with the addition of certain improvements such as a pause feature and the hopes for new playlists/workouts. This could be so much better even though it is an awesome concept already. I would pay for an expansion pack if the developers took it legitimately to the next level."
3505,willn,"Apr 10, 2020 at 6:16 PM",3,"Great workout game, but buggy & crashes","I love the game, and the classes are great. But I can only get through about 1/3 of the classes I play because the game randomly freezes which means to keep working out I have to close out of the game, then restart and replay the entire track. This can be very frustrating when I'm over halfway through the class and it crashes randomly. This happens almost every day."

I do wish there was a pause feature just so I can have a second to whip away the sweat without losing time or possibly messing up your score when doing the longer workouts. All in all though I love it and have noticed a difference and am motivated to get up that extra 30-45 min earlier to get it done and start my day off right."

Also, it sometimes fails to accept punches I think are good, especially in the side/angle cases.   It might be useful to have floating text that says exactly why a punch is rejected...   & a ‚Äúforgiveness‚Äù setting that allows more leeway in what to allow."

Which I find to be useful, it's certainly a workout. But you don't really get to customize much. You choose 10min - 60min sessions. They start slower and get faster.  Just like in the video: jabs, hooks, and uppercuts, come at you like beat maps. 

Every stereotypical song about ""never giving up"" and ""being a phoenix rising from ashes"" is programmed in, but I understand you can sideload custom songs?

3 backgrounds. 1 type of single player mode (punching to music). Not the most fun but definitely useful."

I never ever write reviews for anything (including amazon purchases) but This totally deserves it.  I would highly recommend this, but make sure you get some sort of cover for your fave cause you will sweat a lot!  Only thing I wish the developers would add would be low barriers that you have to jump over akin to jumping rope.  Other than that I can‚Äôt give it enough praise!  If you want to get your heat rate up and have fun doing it...get this game!"

3531,HH,"Mar 3, 2020 at 1:34 PM",5,A real workout!,"If you really want to break a sweat, this is the game for you.  Personally, I was looking for something that would really get me going.  And like most people, I hate going to the gym, I hate weights and I'm not so fond of machines.  what this game does is it gives you a real workout, and I mean really real, in the comfort of your home.  It's entertaining, the music is good and you really do have fun.  I started off using the shorter routines but within a couple of days moved up to the 45 minute routines, for the sole purpose that I was really having fun exercising.  

Now; a couple of tips:  first of all, it is not a fighting game, so relax and don't make it about power punching.  This is about focus, speed and consistent vigorous movement.   If you punch hard, you will become tired very quickly, so just try to make it about speed not power.  Secondly, don't rush it trying to be accurate and don't stress over missed punches.  Within a few minutes, you will have found a rhythm and before you know it you will be focused and more accurate and more relaxed.  You will find that time flies and before you know it, your workout will be over, leaving you drenched in sweat.  Honestly, out of all the times I have ever worked out in my life, this is the first time I look forward working out.  Enjoy!"
3532,Sarah,"Jan 15, 2020 at 6:30 AM",5,BoxVR is my gym,"Like many other reviewers, I am just not a gym person. They‚Äôre smelly, they take time to get to, they cost money, and most of all people can see you doing your thing. Yuck. 

So I bought a treadmill. That I still don‚Äôt use. 

But since I got a quest for Xmas and bought this game, I‚Äôm ‚Äúworking out‚Äù every day. Making exercise a rhythm game was the perfect motivator for me and I‚Äôm super glad to have found that out! 

I do have some requests/suggestions for future updates. Custom glove/target colors or even different glove styles. If Beat Saber can do it, so can BoxVR. I‚Äôd also like some indication of each workout‚Äôs intensity level- whether it‚Äôs upper body only or very squat intensive, is it beginner, intermediate or hard?That kind of thing. 
I also second the need for custom music. I‚Äôd happily use my computer to side load songs if that was an option. 
I would also love to see more arena environments. I want to box on a glacier in the arctic. Or in space floating on a platform. Or in the rain maybe. I dunno, I just get bored of the scenery. 

I‚Äôm also at a loss when it comes to pausing the game. If I take off my headset (mostly because I‚Äôm sweating too much and need to wipe it down) and then put it back on, I have to start from the beginning of the workout. Same goes for if I use the menu button to pause. I can‚Äôt seem to figure out how to pause and resume a longer workout without having to restart the whole thing. I‚Äôd love to do the longer classes, but after 15-30 minutes my headset is sliding all over my face and I need to take a second to wipe it down. 

All in all, it‚Äôs very nicely done. And honestly, anything that motivates me to actually get my heart rate up? Pure gold. Worth the price of admission for getting the quest just for this game alone. Hands down."

If you put some effort into the punches you get a proper sweat on. I‚Äôm looking for some wrist weights to try with it. Struggled a bit to start with missing a lot of the targets, but this has improved with practise and a bit of an adjustment to the glove settings. I got a silicone cover for the headset so it can be cleaned easily. Good fun!"
3536,wbukegirl,"Mar 2, 2020 at 3:01 PM",5,Holy cow! What a workout!,"I was debating buying this versus Ohshape. I decided on this one due to the reviews on oh shape about body composition is not fitting through the slots (I am trying to lose weight) and I am so glad I did!! Well I‚Äôve only done a couple of the beginners, but I can honestly say that this is getting me moving. It was a fun full body workout with lots of different punches, squats, and leans. So excited to take this further!! I will say that the tutorial needs to have a section on WHEN to punch as I had to figure that out on my own. Buy it! You will be happy you did!!"
3537,Kelly,"Jan 26, 2020 at 5:20 PM",4,Excellent exercise programs,"I love this app for the great workout I get every time.  I have used most of the 30 and less workouts so far and they are all great!  

I have only 2 complaints. 

1.  The system has glitches out mid-workout a few times (5-6 x) since I have been using it.

2.  There is no good way to pause the system if you need to and then resume the workout where you stopped.  I can recalibrate the gloves and restart the workout or quit.  It is frustrating to have to stop for a second within a few minutes of completion and loose all of the progress.

Otherwise (and in spite of problems), totally worth it!"

The difficulty only really increases with duration, but that‚Äôs fine. I was really looking forward to moving over to the Quest so I wouldn‚Äôt be encumbered by the cord. 

However...
On Quest: 1 Star. Rapid movements aren‚Äôt picked up to the point of being incredibly frustrating. I‚Äôve tried about a dozen times to play but abandon shortly in because it just wasn‚Äôt picking up the hits. Gloves are precisely where they need to be but the contact isn‚Äôt registered when you have to do multiple hits in succession. I‚Äôve watched multiple tip videos (made sure enough light but not overhead or direct, arm position where tracker can see, making sure punches are clear, played with tracking settings, sensors clean, etc). I don‚Äôt know how people are having a good experience with this game on Quest at all. I certainly don‚Äôt recommend it"
3543,Chivonne,"Mar 28, 2020 at 2:32 PM",4,Great workout!,"Box VR is my go-to fitness app. Having done box-fitness for years, this is a great alternative. It's a bit of a learning curve trying to get the hooks and uppercuts, but once you adjust your gloves and get the hang of it, it's awesome. 

I do wish it had more environments to work-out in, outside for example. An easy way to make a list of favorite trainings, a warming up and cooling down would be a great addition too. Possibly even a Tabata training.

But those are just extra's. If you want an app which gets you in shape while you forget your working out because it's fun? This is the app for you!"

3558,Mike,"Mar 25, 2020 at 11:04 AM",2,Rhythm Game Rather Fitness App,"This is more Rhythm action than fitness. The songs have clearly been transcribed to match the music which causes some major issues from a workout point of view. Firstly, higher tempo songs group moves together so quickly that it forces you into poor boxing form. You end up having to do more wrist movement than full arm and upper body workout. This reduces the effectiveness of the workout. The tempo of the songs makes for an uneven work out. Just as you start to get some high intensity work the tempo will change and you will lose the cadence. Also, the hit box and force feedback is all geared to rhythm action. If you hit the orb dead on you get feedback, if you don‚Äôt then there is no feedback. Again, for a workout this will throw you off, acknowledge that I threw the punch and maybe display a %value for accuracy. The cal counter is very simple and significantly off. Again, the small wrist movements count as significant movements when actually your body is not exerting itself at all. This could be a great fitness app it they drop the rhythm action and transcribe the orbs more like a VR instructor. Maybe in the future, they can add a fitness option which contain proper workouts, and the music is there just to get you pumped up for the work out."

Once you get past the initial Beat Saber-ness of the mechanics (and how many rhythmic games do we need?) and you start going into 20 minute sessions, 30 minute sessions, and beyond, it really becomes a legitimate cardio boxing session. After a month with this as my morning workout I‚Äôm feeling the difference, I‚Äôm seeing a difference, and am pushing harder every day. The timing and angles of your punches take some practice to get down, but before you know it, you‚Äôll be throwing some rapid fire combinations.

3574,Mega Prawn,"Mar 19, 2020 at 7:40 PM",3,"Good enough, but not without faults","The video on the store page tells you pretty much everything you need to know about the game: you punch orbs to music and dodge floating orange girders. It is definitely capable of elevating your heart rate and working up a (lot of) sweat, which is obviously the most crucial factor. It‚Äôs also quick to get into a session, and fun enough that time flies by relatively quickly when you‚Äôre playing.

However, it also suffers from some irritating hit-detection problems, and the scoring system left me feeling annoyed and unsatisfied. Visually it‚Äôs perfectly fine but nothing to write home about, and the experience lacks the polish and visceral satisfaction of some other games (e.g. Beat Saber and Thrill of the Fight). Overall it‚Äôs just about worth the asking price if it sounds like something you need in your life, and on balance I would recommend it, but I feel it could be miles better with a few tweaks.

Have much more to say but the word count is too small!"

3578,mikemartin76,"Feb 17, 2020 at 3:27 PM",5,‚ÄúGame‚Äù changer!,"I‚Äôm 43 years old. I used to be in great shape, but I‚Äôve never been a fan of the gym, I always found lifting or doing cardio to be excruciatingly boring. However, I could play hours and hours of basketball, football or any other competitive sport without batting an eye. Since My wife and I had kids and the demands of my job changed, sports have fallen completely off the map and have taken away my only source of enjoyable exercise. In the past few years, I‚Äôve gotten fat...and now I feel old! I‚Äôve tried walking/running, but it induces instant boredom. Now, with a combo of this game and Thrill of the Fight I‚Äôm back to moving and enjoying myself. I‚Äôm still new to it, but I can tell that this is something that will never bore me. The best part? I can do this in my home, on my Quest, with no wires, earbuds in, 4:30am and not wake anyone up like I would if I hit my heavy bag! It‚Äôs an awesome game, and a very good workout - even my 13yr old son breathes heavy with this one!"
3579,Joe,"Jan 5, 2020 at 12:28 PM",5,Don't forget your towel,"By far one of the most exhausting experiences in VR (in a good way). Ok the concept is basic but sometimes the simple things really are the best. It's a boxing rhythm game that challenges your fitness levels. 

The collision detection seemed a bit off at first but once you get the hang of it, it's spot on. You throw various punches including jabs, hooks and uppercuts while also performing blocks and doges. 

I play this almost everyday as part of a workout but also because I genuinely enjoy it. It requires minimal investment of time and brain capacity. Throw it on, hit stuff for X amount of time. Sweat loads. 

The ability to create your own playlists with the song library is a nice touch but I would love custom songs. Perhaps this could be done via an API call to Spotify or maybe even using the microphone on the quest to detect externally playing songs. Obviously there are legal hurdles that prevent somethings but custom songs would be fantastic."

3582,Khal33si75,"Mar 11, 2020 at 5:42 AM",4,Awesome game,"I really love this game. It really gives you a good workout. The only issues i've experienced is the gloves sometimes move around on its own so its distracting and sometimes when I pause the game, it keeps running which gives me missed shots. It takes several pushes of the button before it pauses. Not sure if it is an oculus issue or game issue. 

It would be nice if they added additional environments like a beach, mountain, waterfalls, etc. 

I would recommend this for anyone that is looking for a good workout. It goes from beginner to a more extensive workout. You can set goals which is great and fhere is a daily routine you can complete as well."

I use it when I get bored at the gym & can continue exercising because box VR is fun and elliptical strider is monotonous after 30 minutes, as is the treadmill."

3597,Markton,"Feb 2, 2020 at 1:28 PM",4,Great Workout!,"54, trying to lose weight and regain some shape, and tried a few boxing apps. This is awesome for me! Burning more calories per workout than treadmill or stationary bikes, and challenging muscles without weights. Two improvements would be to allow importing of my own music in quest, and tuning hand tracking as I lose the left hand on occasion. While I am able to reposition, it breaks streaks and momentum."
3598,IIURDooMeDII,"Feb 25, 2020 at 11:37 PM",4,Intense and structured workouts,"I would say firstly my only gripe is that the collision detection can sometimes be a little off and it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter how you adjust the gloves it makes little difference. That being said, this title offers workouts of varying difficulties and lengths for all ages. you can set your exercise goals and weights and age and then either  create your own workout or take the ones that have been professionally choreographed. The longest workout ive seen is 60 minutes but unless you are in the upper fitness bracket id stick to no more than 15 minutes a session, possibly 4 sessions a day would burn off about 450 calories so definitely worth it!"
3599,yawzway,"Feb 14, 2020 at 2:30 AM",5,,One of the best games in terms of cardio. I'm more exhausted playing this than even 12 rounds of Thrill of the Fight (another amazing game).

3600,TabersmashOT,"Mar 9, 2020 at 3:47 AM",4,Gets old,"This is a fantastic workout, and the songs can be enjoyable, and I can usually burn about 12 calories a minutes, but this game just gets very old, very quickly.

Asked for a refund"
3616,Paul Gregory,"Feb 18, 2020 at 12:36 AM",4,Awesome! Perfect excuse to buy a Quest.,"This is without a doubt the best fitness focused game I've played in VR, it really feels like a serious workout, my watch tells me I'm burning some serious calories (more than the in-game estimate), and it's engaging, I actually look forward to working out, as does my 15 year old daughter, both massive fans.

There are some things that could make it an even better experience:

1. The main complaint, the feeling of involvement isn't as good as it could be. When you punch the orbs, they just stop and fade out, with a number of some sort floating above them. The number is so close it's totally useless, can't read it anyway. The effect destroys the illusion of interaction. Compared to Beat Saber, where the cubes break and fall when you slice them, this gives a much more immersive and satisfying effect. I think it would be great if the orbs smashed as you hit them, and shot back in the direction of the punch, this would enhance the feeling of involvement immensely.

2. The music, there is an amazing variety of music in here, something for everyone. The ability to make your own play lists is great, however, it's very difficult to find favourite songs. It would be great if, at the song changeover, the interface just showed you what song is playing in game. This way, as you play the predefined workouts, you could identify and remember your favourite songs. Also, why not show the artists? It would be really nice to know who the songs are by. Finally, I'd certainly pay for song packs by well known artists, that would be awesome.

3. What on earth are the rings on the left display supposed to represent? I've  been trying to work this out since I started, they don't seem to make much sense at all.

4. Finally, the calories calculation seems to be way off. When I enable YUV in game, it's calculation is much closer to that of my watch."

3619,Matrixsleeper,"Feb 4, 2020 at 5:16 AM",5,Exceeds expectations,"I was looking for a new way to warm up before exercising and also something to fulfill my cardio requirements and BOXVR fits the bill perfectly. Great music and selection of workouts. Easy to pickup and get right into the workout. It's also alot of fun but this really is geared more towards exercising than a game.  There's still leader boards, so you could treat it like a game but overall it just makes exercising so much more fun. Being in a VR world also does make it feel like a real gym. Great app for anyone looking to get in shape."
3620,Elaina,"Jan 20, 2020 at 7:13 AM",4,Almost perfect,"This is one of the most effective entertaining workouts I've ever had the pleasure of doing.   The targets are pickey about how you hit them in a good way.  The music selection is fantastic.  The graphics are surprisingly decent. The whole affair is very engaging while giving you a powerful full body workout.     

This game has one glaring omission from the PC version of the game, custom songs.   If they were to implement that feature into the Quest version or even allowed custom songs from the PC version to be imported it would be hands down the best rhythm game out there. It would also be nice to have more than the three environments that are currently available. All in all the issues I have with this title are fairly minor considering all that they have done right with this title."

One thing I really appreciated since Oculus doesn't yet have an option to sign in different users this game allows you to create different user profiles which is what I needed for my daughter and I to use it. 

I love that you can create different playlists of the built in songs to create different workouts."

As long as you take the moment to calibrate your in game gloves, you will hit the targets with practice. Some levels are very challenging which gives me something to train towards. 30 minutes in and I have gotten a great workout. I just need to figure out how to keep my Oculus from absorbing too much sweat üò∏

For future updates I would love to see the following:

-A level builder where you can select your targets/obstacles and also the ability to add your own music.
-accurate calories burned based off of time, activity level, and user weight/age. I also use my Fitbit to guage calories burned, and while I understand accurate calories would need more incoming data (weight, age, heart rate, etc), using the current user profile metrics should affect the in game calories burned!

Still, it is a great game!"
3637,TurnerThree,"Feb 3, 2020 at 9:33 PM",3,"Love it, hate aspects of it","I start by comparing this to Beat Saber. 
Beat Saber - better music that gives you a sound clip preview of the song, varying levels of difficulty, way more mentally complex, never glitches
BoxVR - simplistic interface with no sound previews, loads slowly, sometimes fails to load the first time, when it glitches its bad enough to make me almost fall over and puke ... I keep expecting to have a seizure

That said ... I love it despite the flaws/room for improvement ...  and try to put in at least 40m a day. I put on an 8lb vest and add .75lb weights to my wrists and by the time 40m are up I am dripping with sweat."

I swear the side effect of this app is that it has made me more focus outside of VR, strengthening those neural pathways as much as your reflexes and core. If getting in the zone to good music while working out is for you, then this is the app for you. Developer note, I'm still not entirely sure when and why I get a 900 point hit and almost the same hit will get me 125 points the next time, my hits are getting better and scoring higher so there must be some logic to where you hit, when and how hard but I haven't been able to make an exact science of it yet, maybe that is half the fun..."

One of the best fitness app around that also motivates you to get into the game rather than the feeling of dragging your feet to the gym.

However, I have problems with the boxing part, every now and then I will still miss the punch, even though I am very sure I punch them correctly. I am not sure if it‚Äôs due to quest tracking system or the boxing mechanism, hope this will be further improve. It‚Äôs frustrating when you have a long streak and  your punching glove suddenly disappear or not  hitting the target as expected."

I‚Äôd tried it at my sister‚Äôs place last week, and while I pretty much sucked at everything but blocks and straight-on punches, I purchased it, anyway, because after reading the reviews here, I was encouraged that practice would help. It definitely has! I played so hard the other night that I had seriously sore arms and shoulders yesterday. üòÇ Went back to it this evening, and I found my accuracy to be much improved. This is my go-to cardio workout going forward. It‚Äôs fun, challenging, and brings a decent calorie burn. The music tracks are perfect and keep me moving throughout each session. I look forward to exercise, now, and that is a good thing! Now, if there was only a way to get my barbell into the VR world, my life would be complete."

3650,FireMaster,"Feb 10, 2020 at 2:39 AM",5,Love it!,An active game that tracks calories burned and motivates you to keep coming back. Allows you to create multiple user accounts so that each person‚Äôs stats stay separate.

3652,katy.eaton.14,"Jan 22, 2020 at 4:24 PM",5,Not a game,I was looking for a fitness app and got it. After playing it two days on the run for 30 minutes my whole body was aching. The previous review is right. It‚Äôs not easy and your not going to hit every target but if you pay attention as to how your standing and the heights of the targets I guarantee that you will feel like your playing completely different by the end of the week. Best thing I‚Äôve bought so far. Really excited to see more fitness apps.

3654,DC,"Jan 12, 2020 at 6:03 PM",5,Fab workout,"I've had this a few days and love it. No tracking issues for me, the occasional right hook misses but that's probably me! Music is ok but would be awesome with music packs like Beat Saber.
Punches land on the beat, the variety in each workout changes very quickly so it's not just jab after jab and you have to concentrate on what's coming next. Looking forward to doing small 15 minutes bursts a couple of times a day and working my way up to the longer programmes. Recommended purchase."

3657,EdNigma,"Jan 13, 2020 at 3:53 PM",1,Wish I had read reviews about tracking,"Bought because I enjoyed the Vive version and wanted a mobile version. WHAT A MISTAKE. This version is a completly different game. Literally even the colors dont match. Would be like if beat saber made a quest version and didnt give you red and blue notes, and changed how the notes look, and the hit detection on notes. It's just awful. I tried to like it. Mapping the gloves a little further out from my hands helped a bit bit I would still miss hits for no good reason. Very discouraging when you're trying to enjoy a game. And for $30... no. Keep your money. I'll keep working out in other VR games."

3663,Aaron,"Jan 25, 2020 at 11:35 PM",2,Audio/visuals not synced,"I really wanted to like this game‚ÄîI have beat saber and it‚Äôs my absolute favorite game, as I can have fun and work off calories. I was hoping this game would be similar, but a better workout. I played it for an hour, and it‚Äôs definitely a good workout; however, if you‚Äôre the least bit musically-inclined, you‚Äôll notice that the beats on which you‚Äôre supposed to punch are just a tad later than the targets, so you always have to punch *just* before the beat, which makes it incredibly annoying and close to unplayable. The game is such a good idea and I would give it five stars if this wasn‚Äôt an issue, but because of that syncing problem, the game is hard to really enjoy."
3664,Pirsuit333,"Mar 29, 2020 at 1:57 AM",5,Excellent game,"I love this game. I'm convinced it gives you the best workout for burning calories. The new metal tracks are my favorite to work out to. If this game lacks anything, as Christopher Walken once said on Saturday Night Live, ""more cowbell"". But seriously, the metal genre works great for this game. If possible, I would love to play this game to a bunch of artists I actually listen to."
3665,Spiralnyne,"Feb 21, 2020 at 3:11 PM",2,Did not like this,"After playing Beat Saber I was looking for another game for working out. After reading reviews on this game it seemed like a good option. Unfortunately the user interface isn‚Äôt very friendly and the game feels like it was designed by a novice.

3670,JCBnPDX,"Jan 19, 2020 at 5:16 PM",4,Brilliant but issues on Quest,"We find it a great workout with a wide variety of skill levels. I found the UX wasn‚Äôt overly intuitive but once I figured it out we‚Äôre good to go. PROBLEM - 3x BoxVR has crashed  in the middle of a workout AND on crash it doesn‚Äôt keep the stats up to that point. Not sure if it‚Äôs a Box or Quest issue. Fix that, we‚Äôll upgrade to 5 stars."
3671,Cody,"Jan 5, 2020 at 7:39 PM",5,Fun and challenging workout,"The whole family loves this game! Tips for new users: adjust your glove position and watch for your gloves in front of you. It requires good form for jabs, hooks, and uppercuts. Your gloves need to be in motion as it touches the target. You also have to be in the correct motion for the target type. Take a few minutes and practice the easiest levels. Before long, you‚Äôll be hooked!

One suggestion for improvement: give a video tutorial that shows what the punch motions look like and allows you to practice them."
3672,Finch-que,"Dec 17, 2019 at 3:18 PM",5,A total workout,"After using beatsabre for a while I found it enjoyable but not an all over workout. I wasn't  sure if I'd like Box Vr but I have to saw I was pleasantly surprised.  Okay, at first I was like wth is going on as I missed all but   straight forward moves but after a few tries I manage to workout my timing issues not 100% but I'm getting there. It seems like there are a few different levels to try and I'd like to be able to remove the block option as this is annoying  as gell for me, maybe when I'm more advanced it will be easier but for now it's too hard to transition. I saw options to tick off n on like beatsabre but now can't find them??? 
So I'd say 9 out of 10  with the Hope's content is added and kept free. 
Enjoying this and most definitely a WHOLE body workout  seriously sore for days after. 
Good job."
3673,Lynxie,"Jan 26, 2020 at 8:37 AM",5,My favorite workout!!!,"I workout to this everyday. At first I didn‚Äôt do very well because I wasn‚Äôt punching at the correct time, but once I figured it out, it‚Äôs great! If you‚Äôre looking for a good workout that‚Äôs fun and the time flies by, get this!"
3674,RocFlanagan,"Jan 6, 2020 at 10:28 AM",5,Great work out.,"I haven't played this but a few hours, but I think I' have the good sense of it.  I like this VR gamercise. It really keeps you moving.. the work outs are varied and tough.  I see a few reviews complaining about the accuracy of the controller mapping. I think that's mostly incorrect.   It's actually pretty good and I can't really find fault with it. I would say keep your punches short and shallow, you don't need to take as big a swing for the hooks and uppercuts.  
Positives are great work outs and the Music is suited perfectly for the work outs. 
Whenever, full body mapping is developed, this game will wipe you out. 
Negatives I would say aren't that much of a problem, maybe being able to choose your own music, and more varied workout settings. (perhaps that's an rewards/unlock feature I haven't got to yet.) 
Improvements I would maybe recommend for the maker:
More separation for the right and left punches. Have the left punches come a bit more to the left and the right punches come in to the right. They come in just a little be to much toward the middle than I think they should, IMO. 
The tutorial could be a little bit more detailed in explaining the best motion punch the targets for each type of punch.  Maybe add the function of running a free form training where you can freeform practice the punching at various rates of speed.  have a basic beat playing that matches the speed of targets. 
Change the shape of the targets for the type of punch.  For example have the jabs be square, have the uppercuts be a triangle pointing down (at the same angle the round ball does now) and the hooks can keep there current form. (or some variation) 

anyway I recommend this. it's a great work out and kind of fun and challenging."
3675,whosgotmymoney,"Mar 26, 2020 at 4:53 PM",4,Good App to sweat indoors.,Yeah good app if you need to burnt some calories each day indoors.

3677,goturbo,"Jan 12, 2020 at 3:08 AM",5,"NOT a Game, Much Better","Skip this app if you think this is a game, and you're just going to use it for fun, like Beat Saber or Synth Riders. Nope. Unlike even Expert levels on Beat Saber, this will take away your breath in minutes and give you a real, actual workout. Proper form is rewarded precisely (unlike BS, which is much more lax). Unlike Synth Riders, the punches actually land on beat. It's awesome. Yes, it takes some time to master punches and form and I wish the tutorial would go more in depth here to prevent new user frustration - because you not hitting isn't a bug (for once! in VR!), it's bad form, bad timing. Poise yourself for a general boxing experience, not creative flailing (which is fun to be fair, but not a workout) like in Beat Saber. BoxVR is a workout, where the rhythm is just one thing to keep you going and make punching air more appealing. I also recommend proper weighted gloves to intensify the workout, specifically those with weights on the back of the fingers (instead of on the wrists). Highly recommend, but just keep in mind that this is not a game."

I wasn't sure how intense the exercise would be in VR, but you definitely work up a sweat! I'm a gym enthusiast and train with weights often, so the boxing aspect I find really fun and engaging. 

The music is good and there's plenty of workouts to choose from ranging from 1 minute to 30+ minutes. Fair to say my body is sore!"
3680,Foxer,10/13/2002 0:00,5,5 Stars for Cross-Buy,"Thank you for having this game available for cross-buy! I understand that it costs time and resources to develop a version for the Quest and it would be easy to try to get more money by charging twice (like Beat Saber).

As far as the game, I love it and don't want to rehash what all the other reviewers have mentioned. If you are looking for feature requests - I would love to have a trainer designed workout plan for 3 months where I can track my progress. Either that or a ""Campaign Mode"" where you need to get a certain score to advance to the next workout. This would make it as much game as workout.  I would also love to see DLC (I'd pay) where you can download new gyms instead of the 3 (which, let's be real, it's just 2). I'd pay a dollar to workout on a mountain or something, and that should be extra revenue and not hard to implement."
3681,Nicks75,"Jan 9, 2020 at 1:04 AM",1,Too easy. No custom songs.,"I had great hopes for this game. In short,  its way too easy,  im 260 pounds, out of shape and 44 years and i barely broke a sweat after 30 minutes of playing multiple songs on hard setting. 

Having no way to increase the intensity beyond the hard setting makes the game useless to me as an exercise game as i get a much better workout on other games that aren't designed to be a workout game."

Developer says it's a Quest issue, but all the other and similar games work. Another review says it's about the style you hit the notes, but this shouldn't be the way a rhythm based games works in my opinion. Got it in a bundle, so no refund possible."
3684,Dougie,"Mar 4, 2020 at 1:13 AM",5,Freezes up,This game is great except it keeps freezing up. The past 3 times I‚Äôve played the game freezes up and I have to turn it off and start back.

3692,Spiral Desora,"Jan 4, 2020 at 12:41 PM",5,<3 workouts have a re kindled flame,"The craziest thing about this game, honestly is how much you sweat after a round or two. 
It's a great place to work your cardio if you are a beginner, and also a great play for a cardio vet to have some fun.

Destroys the arms lungs and mid section, helps your mental focus (if you train it) and it always a blast to play or watch. 

If you want a GOOD workout without too much stress, this is the game to go with. 

Maybe add later:
A multiplayer mode would be fun, like a tetris sort of thing, just two people going at once to see who gets a higher score vs (your score was better than/worse than) ect ect



All in all, I love this game. 400 calories every 45 minuets."
3693,eso,"Dec 26, 2019 at 12:56 PM",5,Good (and precise) workout,"For me, this game is the best workout app I have tried so far on the quest (and I have tried some). The tracking is point-on, even on faster levels, so I think the people complaining about that are missing something - pun intended :-). You need good eye-hand coordination though. Nice music collection that fits the purpose very well. Haven't tried multiplayer yet."

Anyway this is an excellent rythm game that rewards players for speed/power and accuracy, firing off secuences of jabs, hooks, uppercuts dodges, blocks and ducks to get you squating your way to fitness.

New content keeps getting added, and I have to say tracking on the quest is excellent and ease of setup just makes the perfect harmony of app and tech, this is now a daily morning routine for me to pop on the headset, box some balls."
3696,Seth Heinzman,"Jan 4, 2020 at 6:41 AM",5,Great game,"I‚Äôve been using it for about a week now. I have had no tracking issues, pretty sure people who have those issues are holding it in the wrong spot for boxing anyway.  This game is a perfect mix between a workout and fun. The music makes time fly by and keeps you pumped and having fun the whole time. 

Wish there was a way to box people. That would be a cool addition to the game."

3698,TigerTerritory,"Jan 24, 2020 at 3:41 AM",4,"Love this game, but...","EDIT #2:  changing my rating to 4 stars for the following reasons:  I would like to see a rating for each workout that states it‚Äôs difficulty, and whether it‚Äôs heavy on upper body or lower body exercises.  It would also be nice to be able to ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù some the workouts so that you can easily find them later. Regardless, this game is fantastic. I bought a Fitbit Versa 2 to see if my calories burned were close to the game, and to my surprise, the Fitbit registered 100 extra calories burned than the game (980 cals on Fitbit vs 886 cals on BoxVR) - which honestly, I thought would have been the exact opposite. The game/workouts are so fun that it really doesn‚Äôt feel like work. Buy the game, you won‚Äôt regret it!

EDIT:  updating my review to 5 stars after following the suggestions provided by the developer below. It seems that it is vitally important to stand exactly where the game tells you to stand, otherwise there are some hit confirmation issues. After making the adjustment, I managed over 1,100 hit streak and 100% on a few levels. Thanks devs!

Original review:  First off, let me say that I absolutely love this game. The music is fantastic and I get lost in it for over an hour every day that I play. The frustrating part, is that sometimes the ‚Äúblock‚Äù function and ‚Äúlean/crouch‚Äù mechanics seem to not work properly. I have no problem with any of the punches, and I‚Äôve managed to get a streak of 500+ hits in a row, but then lose the streak due to a block or crouch not properly registering, even though I clearly did the move correctly. This of horribly frustrating and I find myself wanting to throw my headset across the room when it happens over and over again. Devs, please fix these issues so I can update my review to 5 stars!"
3699,Martini Mcfly,"Jan 13, 2020 at 9:35 AM",5,This is the real deal!,"Dont cheap out, this is absolutely worth the price!

I had zero problems with tracking!  It took a little practice on the timing of the punches, but less than I anticipated. I play this every morning as my workout and would recommend it to everyone who likes active games. It helps me get out of bed in the morning because I look forward to it. New workouts have been added since I purchased which I‚Äôm really happy about since other games you have to purchase new content."

Highly recommended for anyone wanting to start working out in the comfort of their home and in a fun way that motivates them to continue doing the exercise.

If you are looking for a rather based game to score points and compete with friends, then this is the worst option I‚Äôve played. The tracking is absolutely horrible. If you can focus on the fitness aspect of this game, and forget about the points, and the objective to hit targets, then this game is amazing. I burn 1200-1500 calories a night playing this game, but I had to focus on the motions, and my goal of fitness. Once I got past the fact the tracking is terrible, I have learned to adapt to the game to hit some of the targets. Play this game for burning calories, not for a fun rhythm game."

3716,tonyhaydar,"Dec 29, 2019 at 5:25 AM",5,Fantastic!,"Just got the game, played 20 minutes, left out of breath, best workout I had for years! Definately in my top 5 games list! Thank you developers! (A tip for those who complain about tracking issues; you need to hit ‚Äúwith an impact - not touch it‚Äù right on the white) (Advice to those who ask for more environments; do you really have time to observe it? If so, you are not concentrating!) Happy 2020 all!"
3717,Ravengus,"Jan 13, 2020 at 5:19 AM",5,Total workout at Home!,I was drenched in sweat when I did an hour of this game. Totally worth it! Excited to see what else they can come up with ? Maybe a skipping rope mode? Or an even more hardcore mode? Amazing guys my wife and myself loved it !
3718,Kris M,"Jan 10, 2020 at 4:55 AM",4,Great workout,"Great game, awesome workout. But there is what Id consider a pretty glaring flaw. There's no indication of difficulty on the workouts. While they might go up in time there's no way of knowing how intense they are, nor is there a way to resume it if you pause.

This makes it incredibly difficult to workout with the same intensity in a day. I want to gauge my progress and consistently move up in difficult and intensity, but you just can't do that in this game."
3719,Scrumming with Mike,"Jan 15, 2020 at 1:49 AM",5,Love it!!!,This game is a must have for people that love fitness or just want to shed some pounds. Once you learn the form of the punches you wont want to stop trying to get a perfect score. Its a fun way to stay i. shape.
3720,Grizzlyval,"Jan 23, 2020 at 4:24 AM",5,Love it!,"I got the Oculus Quest because of this game. For the past month, I have been playing it on the  the PSVR and loved it. I purchased the Quest because I want to workout during my lunch breaks."
3721,Wama,"Dec 30, 2019 at 2:10 PM",4,I had to live to play another day,Before I got this app I had watched a lot of reviews on it and haven‚Äôt played the creed demo I wasn‚Äôt really expecting much. So I set my daily goals for 45mins hmmmm nobody taught me before I changed it to 30mins it was getting my heart on the fast lane. The next day and day after my body was sore which meant I worked my whole body pinching and docking those bars. Gym membership is on hold for now have got something I can work with.

3724,Jeff,"Dec 29, 2019 at 3:02 PM",5,Fun Exercise,"This is a Must Buy exercise/game for the Quest! It's a blast, it makes work outs fun an easy, without having to hit a gym. Plenty of workouts at different speeds an skill levels. Would like a way to import personal music into workouts too, Industrial Metal would be great to workout to."
3725,supergiantmonkey,"Jan 8, 2020 at 6:03 AM",4,Good for cardio. Not for boxing.,As a pure cardio workout boxvr is excellent! The workouts can get hard and really push your stamina! If you are a boxer looking for a shadow trainer or someone wanting to learn basic boxing techniques then this game might not be the right choice. For that I would recommend the pad trainer on knockout league or creed. Those games will have you throw punches in the correct positions. Notwithstanding boxvr is one of the best cardio workouts on the quest.

3727,Dazzler,"Jan 9, 2020 at 4:44 PM",5,This will kick your butt!!!!!,Any tracking issues are quickly fixed once I learned to punch the chuffing objects. This takes no prisoners!!! It‚Äôs brutal but fun!!! As an operational firefighter this has quickly become part of my fitness regime. Fantastic

3729,slythehangedman,"Jan 1, 2020 at 1:59 AM",5,Definitely recommend.,Good exercise and if you do it right and not beat saber style just trying to hit orbs you could actually even learn some proper technique.  Also this app has taught me to box southpaw even though I'm orthodox so now I can switch stances and still be comfortable boxing.

 I didn't know I had. It's a full body workout. The boxing is so rapid you don't even realize you are doing squats in between punches. I am 47 and getting younger."
3734,Thomas,"Jan 8, 2020 at 11:53 AM",3,Slightly disappointing,Could have been so much better. Dosent warrant a refund. By all accounts still half decent. Timing and tracking is somewhat terrible. Ie when your squatting and you come up too fast as you have to prepare for hooks and uppercuts as the tracking so far off. Half the time I feel like a robot just sitting there lithargically swinging arms because if I try to put speed and power into them they have whipped past and I have missed half of them. You can't turn or get power or technique into your hooks and crosses as you miss them. More of a hold your hands out and hope you get lucky. Come on devs fix this please
3735,CloudyWithAdance,"Feb 8, 2020 at 7:36 PM",5,REAL WORLD RESULTS,Translates into real world results.   Nothing virtual about that.
3736,ZenPigeon,"Jan 2, 2020 at 6:03 PM",3,Too much like a boring gym workout,"I was after something that was a game first but also a workout, like Beat Saber. BoxVR is a workout first and barely a game at all, which is really boring. But if you like a regular gym workout, this might be for you. It's a workout, but with a couple game elements like tracking your score. It seems pretty well made, polished, and set to good music. I had no issues with tracking and didn't see any bugs."
3737,Michelle Cunich-Colton,"Dec 28, 2019 at 2:01 AM",5,LOVE IT!,I have had no issues whatsoever! It's so much fun to play and has actually helped me to be a better boxer! It is also a great cardio workout as well! I use this to warm up before I go into "Thrill of the Fight". I would definitely recommend this for sure...worth every penny!
3738,DutchSamoan,"Jan 18, 2020 at 8:29 PM",4,I HATE cardio!,"I hate running! I hate treadmills! I hate spinning class! I LOVE BoxVR!!! I can spend 45 min doing this and time flies by. I‚Äôd never last that long doing traditional cardio methods at the gym...BORING! I like to run in place at the same time and that really gets the heart pumping and the sweat pouring. Would love more gym options and more difficult levels with faster combos etc. Would also love if there were some cooler effects and graphics when punching the circles..maybe some slo-mo or explosive effects etc. And please let us choose more than one song at a time when creating a playlist. Annoying to have to go back into the song list menu every time! As-is still a great way to burn off that late night donut binge üòÅ

P.s. There‚Äôs a glitch when you have more than one custom workout profile. Have to close the game after my wife in order to select my profile."
3739,Moritz,"Jan 18, 2020 at 7:27 PM",4,"Good, fun workout.","Bought the app for a fun workout. The gameplay IS  fun and it keeps u in shape. 

But: it takes some time to find a workout with fitting music for you. The workouts are listed by duration time, not music genre. And there is no possibility to see which songs are part of the training. And if u have found a training fitting for u, threres sadly no option to bookmark or favorize it.

So my wishlist for quality of life changes for the game is as followed:
1. Give us a possibility to check which songs are in a preproduced workout, idealy with the option to hear a part of the song. Or at least show a overview of the music genres used.
2. Please implement favorites. For whole workouts and single songs. The song could be liked during a workout after pausing the game. This would also make making ur own playlist much easier. Play some included workouts, like the songs u like and afterwards stick together ur own playlist.
3. Custom Songs. From what i've read on the web, for the PCVR Version there was (or still is?) the possibility of using ur own songs. Would be really nice on the quest too :)"
3740,Nighteye,"Jan 24, 2020 at 1:39 AM",5,An amazing workout!,"Not only is this game fun, but it's an amazing workout.  I hurt in all of the right places."
3741,DJ Oz,10/7/2002 0:00,4,I really wanted to give this 5 stars,"Everything about this game is GREAT! The backgrounds, the tracking, and most importantly, the workout! The only thing I really wish was better were the song choices! Full disclosure, I'm extra critical of music because I'm a working DJ. I've been doing it for twenty years. I play weddings and other private events, and also play techno and other EDM styles at clubs. This absolutely does not make me an expert on music, but I have learned how to control a crowd based on which songs keep a momentum on the dance floor. Also, I do understand that because it's a rhythm based game the songs had to be integrated with the workout motions (I guess, I'm also not a game developer). Now don't get me wrong, all of the songs aren't THAT bad; they have all the qualities of a solid studio produced track that you would hear in a top 40 playlist. Unfortunately for me, most of the songs make me want to sit down! A lot of the songs start very slow, some have too many long interludes, and some are just plain boring and anticlimactic. I know ""to each, his own"" when it comes to music one likes, but if I'm working out I want upbeat selections that keep me going. I suppose since these are actual workout sessions they have moments where you peak, then cool down; but overall the majority of the songs just seem very 'meh', some of the sessions I can't even do because the music completely unmotivates me. I love this game because it is what it says it is; a fitness game, not a streaming music app. But I'm blindly hoping for some possible future updates that may offer new music. Maybe hire the guy over at 'Beat Saber' that selected those tracks, because those types of tracks should be on Box VR (*excluding the 'Imagine Dragons' and 'Panic at the Disco' packages.... Those are not bands to work out to either!)"
3742,Nichole,"Feb 12, 2020 at 4:56 AM",4,Great workout,I was looking for a game with a good workout and I found it. I am usually exhausted at the end of a workout yet it‚Äôs so fun I wish I could keep going. Highly recommend!
3743,DiDDLY,"Jan 16, 2020 at 8:55 PM",4,Awesome,"Oh my gosh - I love this! I have been trying to find an effective fitness game for ages... Wii, Nintendo Switch etc, which never really worked for me. But this, this is different... I feel like I‚Äôm in a fitness class - and I love it. The music is pumping and the moves are challenging. Many different ‚Äôclasses‚Äô to take separated by intensity, plus a daily class.
If you‚Äôre looking for a VR fitness app I would recommend.
I have deducted 1 star as on the quest I don‚Äôt think you can import your own music which is a shame."
3744,Gpo67,"Feb 9, 2020 at 1:05 PM",5,Funny and usefull for boxing amateurs,One of the best fitness experience on vr.
3745,Gas√≥n,"Jan 15, 2020 at 12:49 PM",4,Great workout! Ugly graphics...,"I'm only beginning with this and will probably update after some time but I find this perfect for cold gloomy winter days when going out is not so fun but I still want to move.

Pick q workout and you'll be sweating in no time. Surprisingly good for the legs as well as it requires you to go up and down a lot.

My only critiques is that I still find it hard to hit from down... Not sure if it's about my posture or a design flaw. Maybe some videotutorials would be helpful.

And also I would LOVE the environments to be a bit better looking. It's not really important but it would make the experience much more enjoyable for me to not be looking at a horribly low res building while I'll train.

But overall I'm happy and I would recommend this to anyone looking into VR fitness"

This has been a valuable tool for taking steps to improve my cardio"
3752,Awsum,"Jan 9, 2020 at 5:05 PM",5,Great workout,I love this app as an alternative to the gym. It's so much easier to squeeze in a quick workout with this and it's so much more fun. I love this app!  It is a legit workout. I love it!
3753,ronnietucker,"Jan 13, 2020 at 8:27 PM",4,,"Just played my first game of it. Played the three beginners classes and the first class after that. It was good and fun, but just a shame all the beginner classes are music that I'm not into. It'd be nice if the classes were around different genres.
Also couldn't see a way to do a random playlist. That'd be a nice option.
I do like it though."

3755,CJnMeeks,"Dec 31, 2019 at 9:21 PM",5,Fantastic Once You Get the Controls Down,Awesome game!

3757,Cody,"Dec 23, 2019 at 1:05 AM",5,Spot on,"This game doesn't let you slack.  At first I thought the tracking was off because of frequent misses.

3759,Drakill,"Dec 16, 2019 at 3:27 AM",5,Need good technique to hit,"I was worried when reading the reviews about bad tracking. I found if you keep your hands far enough away from the VR headset and have good technique you can hit everytime. (As long as you are not tired) I love this game and actually use it as a work out supplement. It give good cardio and you work up a sweet. If you like timing games, are into boxing, willing to practice and get the technique down, you will enjoy this game."

This sort of no-frills lightweight workout is exactly why I got a quest. I was a bit worried from what I saw online that made it seem like the Creed game was all there was, but very happy to find this. Haven't been this sore from a living room workout since I tried Insanity a few years ago."

3764,Jason,"Dec 12, 2019 at 11:03 AM",4,Best boxing Sim since The Fight,"You need to have quick hand and eye cordination to actually enjoy this, or with substancial practice you will become proficient. There will be a big learning curve if you have never boxed or had time with a speed bag. Most of the tracking issues mentioned are non existant and are a result of improper hand placement, slow (inaccurate) punches and encroaching on your wireframe boumdry.

 I have found only one error on a 44 min workout where a song doesn't play and will continue past the 00:00 timer. 

This is the only exercise sim I look forward to running everyday as a part of my workout program and makes the price I spent on the quest worth every penny.

One thing i wish they would add is a totals counter for squats, dodge, blocks and punches."
3765,Oynx,"Jan 14, 2020 at 2:29 AM",3,Ok but,Coworker talked me into getting this because it had multiplayer.  I paid 30 dollars only to not be able to use multiplayer.  I got a "disconnect" message repeatedly.  I have not seen that in other multiplayer games I have.  With that said I did work up a considerable sweat.  Fix the connectivity issues and I'll upgrade the rating.
3766,Forasp,"Jan 13, 2020 at 9:24 AM",3,Not as good on the Quest,"If you‚Äôre used to playing this game on a Vive or comparable headset, skip on this purchase until the kinks get worked out. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the quest hardware or the port, but way too many solid hits don‚Äôt get counted, sometimes dodge/squats count as misses when they shouldn‚Äôt, and sometimes blocks randomly count as both a hit and a miss. Am I still happy with this purchase now that I‚Äôve bought the game on two platforms? Yes, it‚Äôs a great game even if it‚Äôs a bit broken. Would I recommend it though? Only if you can‚Äôt get it on a desktop.

Developers: add the latency slider from desktop back to the Quest version. It‚Äôs REALLY needed quite badly. In fact, if it were in and it resolved the same problems like it did on PC, this would be 5 stars. Please be considerate of variance in tracking latency due to environmental factors as is always the case with CV object tracking and allow the users to adjust the latency setting to their liking.

Potential buyers: GET THIS GAME! If not on the quest then on the rift or Vive, you will not regret the purchase. The game is a five star game in general that suffers only in its port or the hardware it‚Äôs on. I can‚Äôt for sure say which is the issue, but of all the games I have on the quest, this seems to have more problems with tracking than any other, and so I‚Äôm leaning towards thinking it needs some TLC from its AWESOME developers. PS it‚Äôs cross-buy so if you decide you just can‚Äôt deal with the quest port, you also get it on the Rift (S) for free."

3768,daedalux,"Nov 23, 2019 at 6:40 AM",5,A true workout,"I takes a little bit to get the hang of how to strike the targets, but when you do, you realize that it's promoting good form. You do have to anticipate the beat a bit as well. The faster you strike, the higher score you get. That with all the ducking and squatting makes for a real fun, sweaty workout."

Sometimes doesn't exactly score when I block, and it would be better if the block icons were different color than the Right Punch icons which makes it confusing. Probably an easy fix for the developer. Also would be good if we had different choices for boxing gloves. And not sure if I saw this but is there a way to add in our own music? Otherwise really great!"
3777,Brycebrycebaby,"Jan 3, 2020 at 7:05 PM",4,An actual workout!,"Box VR is great! Beat Saber is nothing more than a warm up / cool down compared to this game.

 The game almost forces you to improve your form by the way the you have to hit the targets. I work a up good sweat in the first 2 minutes, sweating profusely by 10 minutes, and dead in 30 lol.

My only gripe is that I wish they had better music. Some nice upbeat hiphop songs would be great."

3779,SmokeyJohnny,"Dec 18, 2019 at 4:31 PM",4,"Great for Cardio, yet..","it's great and I love it, but it needs the customer song sorted on the quest, and (for me, more importantly) the multiplayer needs to be really implemented. Imagine you select a ""room"" and there are real time 10 others doing the same session as you do with the same songs, with probably a virtual instructor shouting in your face when you miss, how cool would be that? 
Those who complain about tracking issues have the wrong technique (slow, inaccurate).
I really feel like the calory counter goes too fast, I'm just back from a 31 min no-squat (knee issues :( , medium session, and it told me ~130 calories?

3788,tetram78,"Dec 28, 2019 at 7:51 PM",4,Great ! Need 2 more features,"Very exciting to practice fitness with this game !

I would have 2 sugestions :
- adding a Kcal burn multiplier: I plan tu play this game with elastic bands. Should be great to add a multiplier for this. More, we could add in our stats how much kcal were burnt with other activites.
- the possibility to modify the height of the targets : we should punch at an ¬´ oppenent ¬ª head. At this time the targets are too low. The workout could be even more efficient in this way"

Its a shame because i really started enjoying it and after the price i paid for it i would expect freezing not to be an issue."
3790,Frank,10/7/2002 0:00,5,Fitbit gives me Peak when playing this!,Start with Beat Saber for a few months to get your squats perfected. Then go to Boxing VR! This gives you a better workout. Get a standing fan and point at you because you will need it to be cooled down with all the sweating you are going to do! Then get Thrill of the fight to be able to use what you learn on a real fight. Boxing VR is now my go to program for great endurance exercising. Just ask Fitbit... I get over 50% Peak every time!!!!! Oh and I use 2.5 pound hand weight while I am boxing. Feels like I have heavy gloves on! Fun!

3794,Olivier,"Dec 12, 2019 at 7:11 AM",3,Best workout app but can be frustrating,"I have a love/hate relationship with this app. I say ¬´ app ¬ª and not ¬´ game ¬ª because it‚Äôs not a game, there is no win or lose conditions, it‚Äôs only made for workout. And this part is great, you really sweat. I have been using it almost daily, sometimes for over an hour. But man, the hit detection can really be frustrating at times. People in other comments say ¬´ hit detection is fine, you‚Äôre the one doing it wrong ¬ª. But I‚Äôm sorry, sometimes it‚Äôs just BS, I reach 400 hits combos which are broken because it randomly fails to register a blocking or a squat (the easiest moves, almost impossible to mess up). It seems that the longer you play, the more messed up timing gets. And no, it‚Äôs not because I get tired, restarting the game fixes it. I also noticed that resting the oculus position mid game will also mess up the detection.
So yeah, once you look past that (that you pretty much have to reset the game every now and then), it‚Äôs a really good workout, when you need a quick fix and don‚Äôt want or can‚Äôt go to the gym.

Then there are little things that could be improved : it would be nice if the name of the current song was displayed somewhere so you can easily find it again later if you liked it. Also, some song are easier than others, even on the same difficulty level, it would be nice to have any indication of that. Same things with coaches, you have a name and photo but no more info, and it‚Äôs hard to remember which is which"

Good sweaty workout
A lot of fun highly recommend it

Did the tutorial first and had 0 problems from there"
3798,Ronald,"Dec 25, 2019 at 7:30 PM",4,"Nice work out game, room for improvement","I just got it in the Christmas sales and it does work you up to sweat as intended.

But there is a lot of quality of life changes that I think is easy to implement and would polish the game A lot. 

1. Return to game button when you are in the pause menu
2. Confirmation when you wanted to restart or quit the class

I know you can press the Physical button to return but it wasn't intuitive. Better to give more option to return to the sessions with a button in your menu. And when implement that button, it should be bigger than the restart or return to menu button since it will be the most used one. 
And the restart/return button needed to have a confirmation since user might accidentally hit those buttons and abandon the class by accident. (Which is the worse when it happened where I was just trying to grab my water mid session and now should I start over or just call it a day...)

3. 3 seconds timer when return to session from pause menu

All rhythm game should have this function, period.

4. Incentive to proper dodge the blocks
The dodge mechanic is there so that you needed to squats right? Then it should only be count as one when you squats and return standing position. It happen when you face multiple blocks and if you are lazy you can just do one squats but I believe it was design so that you do multiple squats in quick succession. Either enforce it by breaking the combos if not return to position after each block or give a higher score if you do so.

5. Calculate calories Burn with weight addition
Hoping to use some weight wrists with this for a more intense work out in the future and I hope to see the corrected calories burn with the weight.

6. The adjustment in menu
The parameter input using just a minus and plus and only change one tick at a time is bothersome to input.
It happened when I wanted to change from default 60 mk in workout to 30 and I need to click the minus button 30 times!
A dynamic button when you can just hold it to adjust would be far more sensible. I understand it rarely need to change once you set it up but it is a quality of life change.

7. More background and skins. 
The graphics on background and notes skins leave a bit desire compare to other rhythm games. And as a daily workout, you really want to have some refreshment once in a while.
The three background is basically two with one day/night on the same place and a cyber one. There is no notes skin implemented.

The background doesn't need to be too fancy or up close. It could be just a open stadium like in steamVR starting area and have a 360 sratic scenery on the far side. It should not be hard to implement. 

8. Music import for quest
I understand it is going to be implemented but I really hope it would have Spotify integration. If not I hope it have more than mp3 format since most of my songs are in either FLAC or m4a.


To other users
To correctly register a hit, you need to aim for the white ball inside the grow, the color grow around the ball does not register the hit.
And if you intented to use this daily. Do yourself a favor and buy a silicon face cover. Trust me, you do not want the original face cover after it soaked in sweats."

3803,RickC,"Dec 22, 2019 at 10:52 PM",3,"Great start, needs update!","Dec 2019 update : OK this update includes 12 new workout sessions/songs. That's it. No changes to the ui no new environments, no enhancements that have been requested. And these new songs, I've done about 8. They seem to me sessions they decided not to include in the original release. Can't stand the metal ones and the others just don't have a flow about them. I don't know Box, hope you can offer some real enhancements soon. More offerings of this quality isn't the right direction. 
Original review. 
Let me start by saying I use Box VR as part of my exercise routine several times a week. I really like the concept and idea behind it and have fun while doing it. I'm giving it a 3 because it needs an update! Its too much of a one trick pony. A few things I'd like to see: 
* more environments
* wider selection of music
*scoring of hits is impossible to discern during a session don't know if one hit is better than another. Needs better visual que or removed 
* add another option such as a shadow boxing area where an avatar spars with you 
* right hand target and block should be different colors both are pink now. 
* let the user set their own patterns 

Anyway let us know your still working on things dev's and those of usthat have found vr and especially the quest a great fitness tool will support you!"

I get more sore from this game than I do going to the gym in the best possible way. I'm already feeling stronger and  losing weight. I have a love/hate relationshipship with this thing because it kicks my hind end, but I need it. 

To take this app from good to great... need more premade classes with songs that people know. 

Would also like to be able to join love multiplayer classes where you can see each other, maybe compete 1:1 through user search/ friends list and be able to talk. 

So far this is genuinely helping me get healthier. Keep some new stuff coming so I dont get board and stop playing. It could save my life.

3817,MonkeyFish,"Oct 20, 2019 at 3:56 AM",5,Fav fitness app,"This is a great fitness app. Like other reviewers mentioned, it takes a few 'classes' before you get the positioning and timing right to actually hit any of the targets (except jab and cross which are easy). Once you get the rhythm, it is great. Lots of squats so I have sore legs and sore arms and back from the boxing which is good. I find this works me much more than beat saber which I will play for an hour at a time and then 16 minutes of box vr has me sweating and sore.

Note: I never work out or exercise. I am just lazy in those ways . I got oculus a week ago and use these fitness apps for at least 1.5 hours every day and find it fun and endorphin releasing. I think this is such a great idea for unfit/overweight people who would usually not exercise!"

3819,Stretch,"Dec 11, 2019 at 4:57 PM",2,Beat Saber (even DDR) is better!,"The music selection is horrible.  There's probably only 3 good songs on the whole game.  Most either are gangster rap, heavy metal, southern rock, and some sound like they're directly from the Doom soundtrack.  Basically, I wouldn't pay money to be in an exercise class and have my instructor put on the music.  They would be booed out and forced to change it.  Maybe the company (FitXR) was so strapped for cash they would allow anyone to record their music to the game, in the artists' hopes of becoming famous?

Also, it seems the developers have stopped creating/supporting content for this game.  There's no one in the community section to compete against, and the music and levels never get updated.  Beat Saber is constantly receiving new DLC packs, and Box VR is just the same as day one with no improvements."

3826,senthilrameshjv,"Dec 8, 2019 at 7:08 PM",3,Worth a buy,"This is my second week with Oculus quest and this is the only app that I bought as I want my vr to keep me active and all others require room scale place and I don't have big space. I've been using this for three days now and 30 min goal daily. I would recommend to buy for anyone who likes to become fit with VR.

Now, coming to the reason why I gave three stars. 1. 50% of the time the app opens and stuck in BoxVr loading screen. I need to hit oculus key and quit and the resume it. This didn't happen to me with any app. Sometimes in these times if I go out and just resume I get only black screen.
2. Taking sometimes misses especially upper cuts. Say my left foot is forward, I'm tilted right side which means my right hand is behind. So I'll have to wait for the ball to come closer to me to hit and most of the time it misses. I'll have to make sure I hit it earlier which gives me less score. Vice versa in other hand when I'm tilted left. 

If these can be fixed I'll give the app 4 stars.. One star less as the graphics are passable compared to many other apps and also it looks pixelated compared to similar apps like beatsaber."

3830,atiratha,10/10/2002 0:00,5,Good challenging workout,"The game is immersive and apart from a missed punch or two per hour due to minor tracking glitches, is a great workout for me. Would appreciate more workouts arouns 60 mins for variety, even longer up to 90 mins. The game should also contain a tutorial with regards to posture, because it can get really intense and someone might get injured or have lasting effects due to incorrect posture.

Update: the workouts should get at least a short description or we could be able to review the workouts. Noticed bug in one of the 50+ min workouts, where one song dropped out and you punch in silence. That workout also made the game crash once."

One major issue I have with boxing gyms is the lack of one on one mitt practice in regular memberships. I‚Äôve found most places want you to take personal lessons for mitt sessions and the price tag is high. 25 dollars for half hour session. So, I bought a Bob and did some workouts in my apartment but I was bored and wanting a more involved striking style workout. This game is the next best thing, in my opinion. Once I got used to the timing and changed my striking posture a little I‚Äôve achieved as high as 96 percent connect rates in my first few hours of playing. Tip, keep your fist so you thumb is pointed horizontally when throwing hooks. This is a bare fist style hook so it may take some getting used to. But with my thumb up (boxing style hook) I missed most of the hook prompts.

Anyways 10/10. Can‚Äôt wait to get back in shape so I can put a little more pop in the shots. Good work here."

At least it‚Äôs a fun workout, or it would be if the boxing glove didn‚Äôt stick to your quest headset if you get too close to it. But only with the left hand, for some reason. And god forbid you accidentally change the angle on the gloves, which despite YEARS of community requests still has no way to reset the angle without a complete uninstall of the game. Oh, and one of the buttons has a hidden feature where both gloves become free from controller alignment (when only the trigger is listed), so good luck resetting that.

I want to love this. It‚Äôs an amazing workout, but I can‚Äôt recall how many workouts I‚Äôve had to quit because the music is just so irredeemably awful. I used to just be able to dodge those playlists, but nope, not anymore!

Fox your bugs! Listen to the community feedback for startlingly simple features which people have wanted for years. The Devoa have pushed some major overhauls to the game without little things like a glove position reset button which drastically impact gameplay."
3853,Regi,"Oct 23, 2019 at 6:50 PM",5,Just do it!,I almost didn‚Äôt purchase this because of some of the negative reviews. When it comes to spending $30.00 I‚Äôm careful with my purchases. After much debate I downloaded it this morning. Wow what a workout! The comments about the tracking being bad almost scared me off but I must say I had zero issues with that. I can see myself coming back to this over and over again. If you have tracking issues it‚Äôs probably because you‚Äôre not squatting down low enough and that‚Äôs where the workout comes in. As stated by a couple of other reviewer‚Äòs some variation in background choices would be awesome! Perhaps sometime in the future?
3854,Piotr,"Sep 28, 2019 at 10:25 PM",5,Revelation !!!,I have been exercising for several months. At the beginning it was very difficult. I started with a few minutes because I wasn't fit. (I'm 44 years old) Now I do workout one hour a day and additionally put 0.5 kg on my wrist to squeeze out bigger sweats. I tried with 1 kg weights but they stick to the wrists poorly. I would add that I practice boxvr sometimes after normal strength training and then sleep like a child (tired to the max). After a few months I lost only 12 kg of fat alone.

I can‚Äôt imagine doing 45 or 60 minutes but I‚Äôll work up to it. 

It took a couple of sessions before I figured out how to hit all the different targets. The challenge now is just keeping up with them when they are close together. 

The only thing I can‚Äôt find is the way to view the achievements I scored.  Otherwise, it is perfect!"

I quit the game and restarted it but it came back on pixelated again.  I was very disappointed as I was really enjoying it. I will try it again tomorrow,  I have read other reviews where there system did this so I hope it's fixed as I would hate to return it. It is 2 stars for now as the crashing is a huge issue for me.

Yes I've been to http://bit.ly/Quest-Tracking-Issues. None of the other rhythm games actually need a webpage to explain tracking issues.  That shows you that the devs know its not a polished game.

I leave it 4 stars because there is so much more potential to it:
 Custom songs and workouts. 
Training in groups.
Tracking progress on website.
Integration with heart rate monitors.

I would also would like to see a better tutorial on the actual moves and emphasis on proper form. So far I'm kinda winging it.

3871,Kev,"Oct 9, 2019 at 8:30 PM",1,Will it ever be fixed?,"I have owned this for about 3 months and it has always had those moments were it stops for half a second or so during the course of the session which is annoying. But then about 6 weeks ago it started literally locking up and looping on a bout a 2 second stream and there is nothing left to do but stop it as it is stuck. It is really hard to get excited about using it as workout tool if 1 out of every 3 times it is going to lock up somewhere during the workout. This stuff is not free. We pay for it.

3873,Nobody,"Nov 13, 2019 at 7:50 PM",3,Hate the music,First of all the game play is fun once you go through in calibrate your gloves. it took me a couple of tries but once I got them calibrated the game seem to play pretty well. Actually enjoyed the concept a lot. Unfortunately I went through and listened to most of the music on there and I could only find two or three songs that I actually could not hate. This game used to allow you to use your own music but I decided to give it a chance anyway hoping that the built-in music would be acceptable. Unfortunately for me it was annoying so I'm actually returning this game until such time as they bring back our own music. I heard the PC version still allows music if that's true I'll probably buy it and use the quest link cord to play it that way. I'm not sure why they dropped the support for user music but it's a bad decision because music is what makes a work out enjoyable. hopefully that issue will be resolved and will bring the music back because I really had high hopes for the game and I enjoyed the game play but the music just irritated me so much that I just couldn't take it. Some of you may find that not to be a problem in which case it is a good game.
3874,Cam,"Oct 8, 2019 at 2:49 PM",5,Love it for the workout,"Terrific VR experience. It‚Äôs the closest you can come to shadow boxing in VR. I do hope they add more music (licensed music would be great - I would for sure pay for music DLC like Beatsaber).

My only gripe is that hit detection can feel kinda wonky sometimes."
3875,Nick,"Aug 26, 2019 at 1:00 PM",5,"Great workout, no tracking issues","Like others, there are no tracking issues, it just takes time to get your form right. I've never boxed, done a VR workout or anything like this before and it only took me about 20 minutes to get. I love this, I just wish there were similar games for the quest like this. Only thing it needs to add is clear indication as to how difficult a class is and maybe whether it involves full body (squats) or just upper. Well done"
3876,LQDghost,"Sep 18, 2019 at 4:18 AM",5,VR Got Me Back Into Fitness!,"This app was the catalyst to me getting back into fitness and working out on a weekly basis. Yes, the tracking is still not 100%, but that can be forgiven given what this app is designed to accomplish. The included tracks and difficulty settings make this perfect for any level of gamer or fitness enthusiast.

Some items I would love to see, which would make this the definitive workout solution would be:

1. Include a 360 mode (i.e. Beat Saber)
2. Ability to add your own music and have the beats analyzed to help with hit points
3. Add daily/weekly challenges, including friend/custom challenges and leaderboards
4. Allow for multi-height barriers (to allow for much lower squats) 
5. Add in the option for jumpable barriers.

That last one may be tricky to pull off, but for those extremely versed in VR, pulling off this action would be pretty simple to achieve.

Thank you so much for making working out fun again and for getting this 37 year old back into shape. I would gladly buy this app all over again."
3877,Achillesss,"Sep 26, 2019 at 7:19 PM",5,Great workout partner,I love working out with this app. For someone who doesn‚Äôt like to go to gym this is a perfect alternative.

3879,Amanda,"Aug 25, 2019 at 6:04 PM",5,Great,"I really appreciate this game. Nevertheless, here's a bit of feedback:
1) Please make it like Beat Saber in that I'd like every workout (not just just a separate section at the bottom) to have the option of not making you squat (in case you have knee problems). 
2) I feel that it gets a bit monotonous after a while. I would love someone to invent a game that's a bit like Beat Saber and Box VR but with more variety in the types of things you have to do in the game, in order to keep your mind engaged more. 
3) Also, one thing that really irritated me in the beginning is that in many of the songs, there seemed to be diagonal walls that were only leaning in one direction. Meaning, you were made to lean only right, never left. It wasn't balanced. This annoyed me to no end. 
Other than that, thanks for this great app, great workout!"
3880,domrau,"Nov 3, 2019 at 11:38 PM",2,Timing and Feedback not optimal,"The idea and the concept are great. But there is room for improvement where it matters most
1) If the punshes are synchronized with the music, they miss very often.
2) The visual and vibration feedback of hitting the balls is bad and not rewarding. It feels like punshing through the balls and they explode a moment later where your elbow is. The vibration the is too late. The ball shouldn't pass through the glove. 
3) There should be combos that make the visuals more exciting when the combo is long."

All this is to make it understood that when I say the timing is off - IT IS GENUINELY OFF. You have to condition yourself to time your punches earlier than the BPM of the song which makes it really awkward and frustrating when you miss. And second, there is no way to adjust the strictness of the beat to account for this issue.

BOXVR developers, please go play SoundBoxing or Beat Sabre for a game that handles BPM correctly."
3884,AstroJaguar,"Sep 5, 2019 at 5:45 AM",5,Delay,"I absolutely LOVE this game, but there is a delay between when you punch the orbs and the beat of the music (the orb-punching is about 1 second or so faster than the beat).  This really hurts the experience and needs to be fixed soon.  I have already emailed the developers and waiting for a reply back.

UPDATE 9/4/19: With the new tracking update, the delay has mostly been fixed.  Now, I am back to enjoying this game and have put it back to five stars!"
3885,Kashmo,"Oct 30, 2019 at 2:43 PM",2,Tracking issues!!,"I love the concept of this game. It works well except for the annoying tracking issue that has been mentioned numerous times by other reviewers. I sent an email to support a couple weeks ago to ask if it was going to be addressed and received no response. Very disappointed that this has neither been acknowledged nor addressed.


Update 10/30 This is an update after the developer‚Äôs response: To the development team, have you guys seriously not seen this issue! The circles reach the gloves before the beat! So, you have to hit them ahead of time. Based on your link, I do not have an overhead light or bright light source nearby, I‚Äôve tried adjusting the gloves, etc. If there were a simple timing adjustment in the game it would resolve the issue. There are other rhythm games such as Beat Saber that doesn‚Äôt exhibit this issue."

I enjoy the music and have chosen different songs and lengths of routines for the mood that i'm in.. I do a quick half hour at work for my lunch break just to get a quick exercise in.. I've lost 15kg in a short period of time and find that this gets my heart rate up to an average of 140-150bpm.. I like BeatSaber for exercise, but this is a steady and guaranteed workout with no interuptions... 
As with the PSVR, you have to adjust the gloves for this to work well.. Once you have them adjusted, it's quite easy to hit the targets and get the good (green) scores..

- Rhythm seems a bit off, not so fluid.
- I am sure I am hitting the ""notes"" in time but it does not register. I am seeing my hand go through the note in beat but nada. It is still a workout but makes me frustrated and the sound for ""you missed it"" is annoying when I DID NOT MISS. Flow suffers from this."

However, once I saw all the options on the PCVR version I wonder why this ""game"" cant be more than what it is on the Oculus Quest? Why cant you see previous attempts on workouts? So that you can strive to do better the next time.  The graphics are very minimal and likely well below the capability of the Quest. Is there going to be an upgrade?"
3898,Cartographer-Local,"Aug 31, 2019 at 8:32 PM",5,Best VR workout app so far!,"The workout experience is awesome!  You can customize your glove placement (lining up your actual fists with your virtual gloves) which is perfect and improved my accuracy.

I feel that the easy, medium and hard options are all balanced well.  During a hard workout you will surely be sweating by the time you're done.  This means that this game benefits your heart health, which adds great value IMO.

There are preset workouts and you can create custom workouts.  I would like more room options than the existing 3, but the value is in the workout, which is actually fun and rewarding!

There are virtual objects that come at you in the form of punch, hook, jab, block, dodge and duck.  You don't have to punch hard, just make sure to add some force and hit the virtual object with the correct motion.  On hard mode,  there are many in rapid succession that will have you performing short and rapid  punches in order to hit them all.

After your workout, you get a percentage readout on all of your punches (hook, jab, etc...) along with calories burned.  It's so rewarding playing the same workout and watch the stats raise.  That actually adds to the replayability, trying to achieve 100% on each stat...

I played the Beat Saber demo and like this game better.  This is still fun, but I feel like the workout is more practical.  I'm not going to be using a sword anytime soon that I can think of, but you never know when you might need that punch accuracy in the real world hahaha.

This is a must have for anyone looking for a fun, challenging workout that will have you burning those calories and maintaining your heart health.

Improvement suggestions:

- Add tutorial
- Add more rooms"
3899,Joni,"Jun 14, 2019 at 2:31 PM",5,Wide Learning Curve,"I almost didn't get this app based on the reviews about tracking issues. I purchased it because of some of the positive reviews. After the first hour or so I almost requested a refund due to not being able to hit most of the beats. It was frustrating feeling like I was never going to get it. Then something really cool started happening; I found myself having to try harder, and to challenge myself to pay better attention to my form and how I punch. After repeated trial and error I started to see better results in my form and punches and went from missing most beats to getting almost 100% every time. If you stick with this game and keep practicing the payoff is awesome! After a half hour I have sweat dripping down my back. You will punch, squat, and dodge your way through an amazing workout. This app isn't for sissys who give up easily and complain about every little issue. It will reward those who are patient and can commit to a learning curve. I still miss beats here and there, but I'm toning my body in the funnest way, and it's awesome."
3900,Emil,10/12/2002 0:00,1,"Hit box too small, NO custom music","If you hit too early, you miss. If you hit too late, you miss. To the devs: play Beat Saber for 5 minutes to understand how to fix your app: even if my glove is a bit late, you should consider it a valid hit if it touches the circles. How it is now: my glove goes right through the circle but still misses. It happens a lot on hard level, when my hands are moving very fast.

I do have the following requests that I believe would make BoxVR even better...
1. Being able to sort according to trainers.
2. Crosses and Jabs to the opposite side for more variety and difficulty.
3. Boxing timed classes - IE 12 rounds of 2 minute rounds with small rest in between. This could lead to even more variety and perhaps 'surges' at the end of each round.
4. Bonus points based on punch strength. I notice I get lazy towards the end. Adding bonus for correct form / stronger punches would be great.

3909,Himaji,"Oct 13, 2019 at 1:35 AM",4,"Good for Fitness, but..","BOX VR is great and gives you a great workout.  The music choice, albeit limited (without custom song support), is decent and motivational.

For this to be an even greater success, however, it needs more gamification.  In-game achievements, more pronounced leader boards to compare yourself against friends, game types and challenges that you can come back to daily or weekly.  Unlike going to the gym, or going for a run, BoxVR has the potential to stay interesting in the long term and not fall into the pitfall of traditional exercise.

Excited to see features and improvement in the future from the developers."
3910,JB,"Sep 9, 2019 at 7:08 PM",3,"Decent game, still needs some work","It's frustratingly close to being a full recommend. They need to fix the timing of the hits. You have to punch just a tiny bit too early to hit the targets, which throws off the rhythm. This isn't the case in beat saber, so I don't know why it's a problem on this game since they're extremely similar. It'd also be nice if there were more than three (basically two) workout areas, and if you could set them to switch during your workout. A sixty minute workout can get pretty monotonous."

3913,Gene,"Sep 22, 2019 at 10:17 PM",1,Please fix this,"Loses tracking deep  into long workouts. I think it has a memory leak that starts to cause problems if you play longer than 40 minutes. Crashes occasionally. 

There is no way to pause without having to restart the entire workout. 

No way to tell what a workout will be like (counts of jabs, hooks, squats, dodges). No way to favorite workouts or rate them.

Dodging doesn‚Äôt make sense. For squats, you duck under the bars, but for dodging you lean into them?

That being said, I keep coming back to it. Fix these problems and it‚Äôs 5 stars from me."

3917,Moze,"Aug 29, 2019 at 7:15 AM",2,"Great concept, a bit flawed execution","I really wanted to love this game; a solid boxing workout on the Quest would really help get me back in shape. Love the concept (basically Beat Saber with boxing gloves), and I used to do some recreational boxing for fitness.

THE GOOD:  I found no loss of tracking, game interactions seem good.  (HINT: if hits aren't registering, start your swing a bit earlier!)   It gives a solid workout, even with the early levels. A good mix of game + guided workout.

THE BAD: Only 3 boring backgrounds. No option to avoid squats (I have a bad knee). No idea what each workout is like (music, intensity, squat-heavy or mostly punches, etc.) until you actually play it. Music is kinda lame, no option to add your own.The biggest issue is the lack of description of the workouts. I don't care who designed them; I want to know how intense they are and what they focus on!

I will be returning this game (after about 1 hr of use), but I will be watching for updates and would love to rebuy it if the above issues are addressed. Easily a 4- or 5-star game if the shortcomings get fixed."
3918,Highyena,"Oct 2, 2019 at 10:07 AM",4,"Great game, some issues:","I do not understand the issues regarding missed beats. I have done some strike training and the connection is fairly decent! That said, there do seem to be some small misses where I am fairly sure with a physical target I would have hit...

Thats acceptable! There are some changes I would appreciate seeing. Not being able to add to quest is a HARD HARD HARD loss. I can imagine this is somehow being remedied. But... ow!!! 

I think overhand right and lefts need to be added. You have hooks and straights, but what about overhand shots curling from over to under from left to right? I know you can hit the straights like that, but as for an option for expert modes, this would be a great expansion! 

FINALLY: For another expert function. Since this is more a fitness game and not a boxing game entirely. Why not add jumped hurdles? Beatsaber did it? Jump rope is a standard training in boxing gyms. Make people get into the full experience!!"

3923,SmittenFaun,"Aug 16, 2019 at 5:08 AM",5,Highly Recommended,"If a rythm/exercise game based on boxing sounds appealing to you, this app is a must buy. The quest recently had a patch that improved tracking drastically so those complaints are not relevant anymore. If I had to complain about anything, the app does not teach you correct form so learning the proper stance and how throw these punches ahead of time is recommended. Also a way to hear songs before you choose to play them and a little more organization by difficulty would be nice. That being said its an excellent work out and extremely satisfying. Hope there are more games like this in the future, VR for exercise like this is awesome."
3924,I hate Meta garbage,"Sep 19, 2019 at 11:57 PM",4,Excellent workout; flawed game,"Jabs have to be hit with a fairly straight out motion.  This causes hits not to register if the motion is that of an uppercut.  If you're coming up from a duck and punching out at the same time, you may not get credit; same thing if you aren't keeping your hands up.   The  game is picky about what motions it will count as a hit and some of the faster combos make it difficult.   It also helps to hit the target farther out because the motion is clearer.  These are why people complain about tracking but tracking is fine.
My main complaint is that if I duck too exaggerated or fast, the geadset thinks I'm falling or something and cuts out.  My headset has also gotten pretty nasty from sweat but I guess it is a good workout."
3925,Leonidas3000,"Sep 28, 2019 at 3:42 PM",3,Too fast to twist into punches,"I'll give this game 3.5 stars. I love the concept of this game. And I do play it often. It's one of my go-to's because I purchased Quest to get off the couch more often. 

I'd say the downside is that the workouts aren't designed around good boxing technique. The targets come way too fast to twist into your punches. And that's where your power comes from when you throw a real punch. This also encourages you to drop your hands low and to the sides, while in real boxing you want your hands up and ready to block and parry. 

It also doesn't reward you for following through on your punches. So the mechanics always feel like a quick rabbit punch.

I'm surprised by this because they engaged many trainers to design the workouts and I can't believe nobody mentioned this. It makes me question how much testing was really done. Have you played your own game? 

All that being said, if you drop your hands and shorten your punches, the game is a great workout. I add 1lb wrist weights to increase the burn. And I often use it on my rest days from my actual workouts because it's low impact enough to burn calories without inhibiting recovery too much."

3927,BlinkEGO10,"Sep 24, 2019 at 5:42 PM",4,Does NOT have tracking issues.,"I was skeptical getting this at first because of the ""tracking"" issues. I come from a boxing background and had a short 8 fight career in the ring. The game feels fine and it does not have any tracking problems. I set my wife up on it. She is not athletic or a fighter by nature. She had a hard time landing the shots with a bad stance, technique, and timing. I can see why some people feel it's the game's fault.  Practice and improve your technique. Watch videos or get with someone who can coach you on punching. This game will make you sweat, but feels like aerobic gym boxing by coaches that's never slung leather at another person. It would be nice for a real boxing coach to get on board  to create realistic combos and workouts. Other than being critical of that the game does a good job."

3933,ThePeck,"Sep 20, 2019 at 4:10 AM",3,Could be much better,"The degree of precision is annoying. I've played this awhile and it's just not good. Tracking is fine but you must be in motion the correct time to land hits. I found that holding my hands still and making small movements to hit it works better. Maybe I'm not a boxer and not good at it but when the targets get fast I'm just not fast enough to extend my arm as if I'm hitting and come back in to hit again. Resulting in many missed hits. Again maybe it's just me being older and slower. There needs to be, in my opinion, a little more range in landing a hit. Especially for someone that's not trained.

But after my gripe I do like it, I wish they'd add a couple more Tron-ish areas. I'd love that instead of only one."
3934,Bethy,"Sep 23, 2019 at 6:33 AM",5,Love,Makes you sweat fast and its challenging. Just keep good form while doing. Im a fan of boxing games and this one did not dissapoint.
3935,Colin,"Nov 15, 2019 at 1:43 AM",4,Fantastic game. Couple of tweaks needed.,"Let me start by saying I absolutely love this game. If you throw your punches correctly, have proper form, etc., you get an intense workout. I‚Äôve never liked the gym or working out in general, but this makes it fun and I look forward to playing and challenging myself each day. The different workout lengths and difficulties are great, and the three different locations are solid. However, I am hoping that more are added in the future. It would be really cool if there was a beach or other outside locations.

There are a few things I‚Äôd like to recommend though:

1) I see many people complaining about the tracking. My tracking is perfect, but only because I adjusted my gloves perfectly. You have to go into settings and do this right away or else the game will be a huge failure. With that being said, the first time you start the game, this setting really needs to pop up and be explained better so people know about it. It‚Äôs doing people a huge disservice to not show them this right away.

2) I think the above info should be followed by a brief tutorial that loads automatically, rather than having to find one on your own in the various workouts. Make it easy on people!

3) Finally, I think it was be super beneficial to have a few videos showing people proper form to maximize their workout. Many people have never thrown a punch or done a squat in their life, and by showing them technique, their experience and results could greatly improve.

Again, outstanding game, but I would love to see a few of these changes made!"

- Something to make us jump during the workouts (maybe some box to hit with headset)
- More scenarios
- Different heights for hits 

(I bought the game after last OS update so I don't know how was the experience before. For me now the tracking is almost perfect, no issues when gloves are near the headset)

BoxVR is a much better full body workout with the incorporation of squats. And the long sessions are much better for not having to stop in between songs. While Beat Saber is game first, BoxVR is exercise first. My one complaint is that you have to be really accurate to hit uppercuts and hooks. While that's fine for a game, for an exercise it's a little disappointing when you miss and break your combo by just getting a little off. Personally I would like the hit boxes for those to be a bit bigger.

Update: I take back my complaint about the hitboxes. You just have to be more deliberate with your punched and you'll get used to it in an hour or so."

Just two humble requests, as upon reading reviews here, and on the other VR versions of this game (except PSVR), apparently there was a way this game used to be able to analyze your own music files and create a Box VR course out of it?, PLEASE bring that feature into this version of the game, My parents actually used this game for a bit as part of their routine, but they wished they could use their own generation of music in the game, (i know the track quality wouldnt be as intense as the ones in the game, but just being able to box to their music would go a long way for them to just be more active and motivated)

And if possible, maybe include an option to adjust the size of the ""hitboxes"" on the punches? as the uppercuts and side punches do take getting used to at first, and being able to have the option to make those more generous to hit, would go a long way for again, my parents to be more involved in using the game and to stay motivated in using the game. 

But other than that though, fantastic game, thank you all so much for bringing something like this to the Quest."

There are still some issues with tracking where my glove would fly in the air without me purposely doing it.  It does get frustrating when that happens, and I lose my high score.  I wish we can import our own music.  I don‚Äôt really like most of the music on here.  I think having my own favorite songs to workout to would bring this game to another level.  Overall it‚Äôs a decent fitness game that is a good low intensity cardio workout that I can do daily."

I almost passed over it because the song in the trailer made me cringe, but now that I've played it I'm really liking it and it genuinely gives me a great workout. Oh and the music is a lot better than it led on. Honestly it should remind players to take it slow and don't forget to stretch, because it didn't cross my mind and I ended up pulling muscles, particularly on the squats. Honestly though it just makes me like it more; it tells me it's the real deal and makes me want to push myself."

Lately, it‚Äôs been crashing far too often for me, though. Puts a real buzzkill on a good workout when you get dizzy from the tracking breaking and then the app crashes.

It‚Äôs been crashing at least once per 30 minute workout on the Quest. Devs, please fix this and I‚Äôll update my review to 5 stars!"

You can‚Äôt just put your hand on the target and expect it to register a hit, you have to be precise and have good form. Also, didn‚Äôt notice any issues with the gloves flying away or disappearing. My initial impression is that this will be a good way to get light to moderate cardio accomplished. I hate treadmill, stationary bike etc so this is exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for. Possible to scale difficulty with the addition of weight vest and wrist weights as well.

Maybe some of the other reviews about bad tracking are from previous versions? As of 16 jul 2019, the tracking seems accurate and consistent to me. I‚Äôll report back after I get some more play time if I notice any issues."

That said, it only forces you to commit to form while playing and boy does that burn calories. I have lost 45 lbs doing this, running, doing some bowflex and watching the food a bit. This by far makes me sweat the most. Anyway, I just think this one needs a fair shake."
3977,Laxlad,"Jul 14, 2019 at 7:01 AM",5,Great game legit workout,"Awesome game, highly recommended.  I will say if there is one issue with the game it is that is that it caters more to right handed boxing styles vs southpaw and it is impossible to change it in the settings.  That being said almost all of the lessons have you switch to south paw during the lesson this time is short and not equal to the amount of time in the right handed stance."
3978,mantanz,"Oct 29, 2019 at 6:12 AM",5,I was wrong!,"Updated review:

I had previously left a scathing review stating that the tracking was way off - and it was - but since relocating to the garage so I have more room the tracking has become just as good as the PC version I was using before and BoxVR is once again my go to form of exercise.

I can only put this issue down to lighting as nothing else has changed - so if you're having tracking issues, try in a different environment. Anyway, I'm back to loving this now FIVE STAR app.

Previous review:

This was my go to fitness app on PC (WIndows Mixed Reality) but the tracking is severely broken on Quest. Gloves randomly disappear even when not outside of the cameras' view. It's really frustrating. No such tracking issues with Beat Saber so I'll stick with that for shedding pounds."
3979,FamiComplex,"Jul 12, 2019 at 3:20 PM",5,No tracking issues - A few pointers.,"I just purchased the Quest version of the game after having played on Steam for quite a while, and there's no real difference between the tracking on the two. It is working entirely as expected.

Some important things to remember for a good experience with this game:

First, follow the directions. Always be in the stance the game requests. Not just the direction you're facing - take a boxer's stance.

Secondly, box. This isn't a rhythm game where you're concerned about high-speed taps for score, this is a workout. So, when you're punching, punch for real.

Lastly - and this is the one that threw me the most when starting out - the uppercuts and punches to the sides. Yes, they're hard to land at first. The thing is, in VR you're used to getting big results from tiny movements, so you FEEL like you're doing a huge uppercut but you aren't. Reset your brain on these. Take what feels like a huge, sweeping movement - uppercut like you're in slow motion in an action movie - but make sure your glove is in the hit zone at the end of the movement. Scale back the ridiculousness of the movement as needed until you're consistently getting the hits.

Above all else, enjoy your workout! That's why you're here."

3982,BentMyWookiee,"Sep 24, 2019 at 2:34 PM",3,Tracking Issues,"I really like BoxVR but the tracking issues are ruining it for me.  I tried to ignore the scoring and the streaks that are broken by a glove that just hangs in the air when tracking is lost, but that takes away a big part of the experience - improving on previous scores.   

I would also like to be able to favorite a workout or create a list of workouts.

Update:   Since the last Quest update the tracking is much better.  I‚Äôve added a star to my review to reflect that.  I would still like to see a few UI improvements, such as showing my ranking after a workout vs sending me back to the main menu after a workout ends.  But I now feel it‚Äôs worth the price.  BoxVR provides a good workout and the experience is much less frustrating now.

I know this is also bc of the quest controller tracking issues, but when a standard boxing form requires you to return your hands close to your face and the above is the result it discourages you to keep up proper form.

I've needed relief and It left me more frustrated that i was before. So here you go: my frusration - im giving it back ;)  Hands Tracking is unacceptable, delays and not responsive gloves are nightmare for smooth workout. Additionally synchronization of music with targets is moved too fast. At least in 3 songs that ive tried.  I dont really care about the graphics, so that raw environment and repetetive photos are ok with me...but to be honest for $29,99 (!!) you should have some respect for your customers and at least build or buy proper 3d models.

3987,vinh.ung,"Jun 25, 2019 at 12:53 AM",3,Flawed but hopeful developers listen,"I use this app everyday.  Makes for an excellent workout.  As far as tracking, don't know if the developers can fix the issues. For me, my right-handed glove misses quite often and I don't know if that's a function of the right controller or another mechanic and it will also get stuck in mid air at times.  This in turn ruins the whole experience of it all.
However, I did find the ""adjust gloves"" feature in the options helpful since it increased the accuracy of my hits once properly adjusted.  Took me some time to figure it out, but just make sure your controller matches your gloves in how they are oriented.
Again, loving this app but can't wait for improved tracking and possibly more workouts.  An increased tracklist would also do wonders for replayability."

The game is fine, with minor tracking issues from time to time. I have lost some weight and started toning up. This is the by far most fitness oriented app for the quest but.......
Each update causes issues. My playlist of multiplayer workouts is random at best. Originally it was 15 pages, then 13, then 12, now all the workouts above 46 minutes have completely disappeared.  This is just frustrating.  I would like to see that fixed and it seem like it should be a simple issue."

It theoretically makes for a good workout, but ultimately leads to frustration over the poor tracking.  While playing, my gloves will often stop tracking and stay in one place or float off to the opposite side of the screen.  Other times they won't move until just the moment before impact, which makes for a very disorienting experience.  When in a boxing stance, gloves should be near the temples of the head, which almost always leads to the loss of tracking.  I regret having spent 29.99 on this.  Hopefully fixes come soon."

3991,BiggyDizzle,"May 24, 2019 at 3:11 AM",4,I stood up & did exercise...no sh!t!,"Before I start, I did work up a sweat playing. Should be 5/5 stars however....the devs need to sort out a way to allow us to change the lag with our punches. I see many people complain about they miss some shots, but after playing, it is apparent that the timings that I play are slightly out of sync with the beat. I punch in what I think ‚Äòis‚Äô in time but I‚Äôm told I miss. It works if you hold your hand out early, but defeats the point of the music...If there was a way to allow a slider setting for punch delay (or the opposite) to ‚Äòhit‚Äô the targets it would seem to solve the problem (If you‚Äôve played the latest Guitar Hero it allows you to change your press timing with the beat to sync up your personal delay and this would make this game great!). Nevertheless, back to the game, simple but enjoyable to the extent you forget you‚Äôre actually doing exercise (albeit the lag in your punches to the music as described above which is frustrating when you move out of time to the actual blocks). There‚Äôs great future with updates to this game and you‚Äôll need a replacement foam padding once you‚Äôre done as it does get the heart pumping (#sweaty! üòÇ)...maybe one day they‚Äôll bring out hamburgers to smash, pizzas to block, or some other fun modifier such as holes in the floor to (pretend to) swap feet which would help burn the pounds, but until then, just 4 stars due to the ‚Äòpunch early (before the beat)‚Äô system. It is good fun though and will burn the spare tire...definitely get it for exercise, there‚Äôs no better fat burning comparison out there on the Quest (take as you will)...

Oh, and it‚Äôs not Beat Saber, it‚Äôs a workout app. So buy to burn the fat and don‚Äôt hesitate if you‚Äôre worried you have already bought Beat Saber! (But do take my review into account, BS is on point with the timings of the block smashes, you just have to ‚Äòmodify‚Äô your timings with this..üôÑ.)"

Here are some things I would like to see to improve the game. 
1: A better tracking log. Not just one day but a decent log that you can compare how you are doing.
2. How bout shots at the head where you just dodge your head from side to side so its like a punch.
3. There should be something where you can change the height or have it random so it reflects fighting smaller and larger opponents.
4. More music tracks.
5. Speed bag and a Heavy Bag. With the heavy bag it can just light up where you need to hit it."

My muscles were sore and I felt good after the workout too. There are many songs to choose from and I appreciate the customizable option to fit my need. I choose BoxVR over Beat Saber for exercise. However, I do have some problem of losing my glove several times during every session. It seems to happen on my right glove more often than on left glove. I also couldn't tell which pre-made lesson is advanced, etc. But those problem is not a deal breaker for me, as I know I'm getting a good & fun workout even if it shows that I missed some punches because of ghost glove.

I think the 'tracking issues' from other reviews have to do with timing, not actual software issues. As with real boxing, you have to get your timing just right. BoxVR requires you to work hard, as you must throw your punches with purpose and learn the timing to get a successful hit. This game is fun and a good workout!"

It would be good if the workouts had difficulty ratings and/or were categorised on what areas they focused on. But hopefully, it will continue to develop.

4006,ims,"Jul 22, 2019 at 1:56 AM",3,Great potential - but needs polish,"It gives a good workout which is quite fun and can be hard work. But it could do with some work on many areas. Initially it seems like the tracking is bad but it just needs some getting used to and after that is really pretty good.

It needs some sort of new user introduction as the UI is pretty limited. It can be hard to find good workouts too as there really isn't much info about each one. I'd love it if it had obvious classes that focused on introducing combos and getting harder and harder over time. I think more ducking, weaving, combos and maybe stepping around a little should be added.

It would be great to have a more gamey mode that keeps you coming back. I find I tend to choose beat saber over this as it's a bit too much work to use and not as much fun.

Custom community created tracks/workouts could really help too. Possibly the PC versions allows for some of this.

In short it's a great start but could be a lot better. I hope they polish it over time. I'd pay for DLC enhancements too."
4007,SunEater,"Jul 29, 2019 at 9:03 PM",4,Good Fitness App,"I love using this app, when it's working correctly. With regards to the tracking issues I've encountered, they are frustrating and frequent especially when in the middle of a good streak. The most common and most jarring issue is when the glove appears stuck in a position  despite moving the controller around. To be fair this problem is rectified within a few seconds, however because things get a bit intense in some of these workouts, this causes a lot of missed hits. Another issue that is also rather frustrating is how a recent update wiped all of my progress and stats. Besides these issues, BoxVR is a great VR fitness app.

EDIT: With the recent updates for the app and for the quest, a lot of the previous tracking issues have been significantly mitigated and now this app is one of my favourites. I have added an extra star to my initial review in recognition of the changes. There are still issues but they are substantially fewer than before and I would recommend this app to anyone with a quest."

It is so good I cannot put it down. I‚Äôve been sedentary most of my life and started working out everyday because of this app. Just a tip, don‚Äôt use your normal ‚ÄúCreed stance‚Äù  or defensive stance with your gloves in front of your face. Rather, It should be on neutral level, in front and just below your chin: ready to block, uppercut, jab, or swing. I think they designed it this way for the game to be played properly. I am loving the game as much as Creed and Beat Saber. The workouts are properly paced and segmented in such a way that you can approach it on any skill level.

I don‚Äôt have the tracking issues that other mention - possibly because I don‚Äôt know proper boxing form and keep my hands too far in front of me :). For the timing issues others mention, it seems like the game tries to play the punch sounds in sync with the music which is a reasonable design choice.  So the challenge is to have your punches line up with the music more precisely. The trick to that seems to be to contact the orbs nearer to your chest vs. as soon as they are within reach.

I do have frequent trouble scoring on the uppercuts but this is probably more on me than anything else.  Perhaps the game could be more forgiving here?  It doesn‚Äôt really matter though... I‚Äôm having fun and burning calories regardless of the score."

Fortunately, BoxVR is a better cardio experience. By far, the cardio you get out of this work out is well worth the time and money. Therefore, if you already have Beat Saber and you are looking for exercise, I strongly recommend BoxVR! I love the display calories burnt during an exercise that tracks ALL of the movements during an exercise, even if they are not related to the objective. I found that time to calorie burn ratio is equivalent to an intense cardio exercise. During the exercise, the time flys, so it does not feel like a chore. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because I think there is room for improvement. 

To address VR tracking issues; when I first started, I had missed numerous hits for whatever the reason. Then I realized that the tracking is very specific. Meaning, it is vital to hit precisely as it directs you to hit. I definitely noticed improvement as I had participated in more exercises. However, be mindful, do not hold your firsts/controllers near your face, Oculus reported issues with tracking on their end when they are near head device. Also, in the setting menus of BoxVR you can adjust your gloves to fit your holding style of the controllers so that the hits in exercises are precise. 

My suggestion to improve the application: (1) please display estimate calories burnt for each exercises, otherwise I noticed that 15 minutes exercises some stones yields less calories burnt than 8 minute exercises because the 15 minute exercises do not include dodge and or squats moves. Therefore, noticed that I waste time on exercises that are not as beneficial FOR ME. Maybe even adding an image of targeted muscles groups or type of exercises. (2) Also, I think adding jumping moves may add more to the exercise. (3) I noticed that the trainers that are displayed for an exercise don‚Äôt actually coach during the exercise. I do not understand why their picture is even next to an exercise if they are not part of it. I wonder if adding a virtual version of a trainer mimicking the moves during an exercises may benefit better understanding and improve motivation during the exercise. (4) I have yet to participate in an online event but I wonder if it is something available more frequently with different goals."

Installed on the quest and OK with minor tracking freezes.

Haven't tried on rift S yet.

Seems expensive for such a simple game but with crossbuy  its like I spent 11 pound on rift s and quest so not so bad."
4020,ImSofaKingLazy,"Jul 18, 2019 at 10:33 AM",3,Gets Boring Fast,"Not much to the game except a repeat of combinations of punches and dodges. The levels are just longer periods of it with different songs. The pace doesnt feel like it always follows a rythmic beat so it feels more like you are shadow boxing with music on rather than boxing to the song. There also isnt height adjustment so the punches feel low. It would be better if there were more creative game modes, this feels too repetitive."

4022,Tim,"May 27, 2019 at 5:46 PM",5,Exceptional and highly addictive,I owned this on steam and loved it so much I had to get it again for my oculus quest. Super addictive game. So much fun you forget that you are working out.  You will want to come back to this everyday. In my opinion this game is up there with beat sabre and superhot. I have had no tracking issues whatsover on the quest with this game so was suprised to hear some people have (can only assume they are holding the controllers right up to their faces) but I guess anyone can potentially have different experiences based on size etc. This is one of my favourite vr games to date and I intend to come back to it all the time for my daily fix.
4023,Fred,"May 28, 2019 at 5:06 AM",5,Love it. Huge potential.,"Wow love this game. Great workout. I wish I could upload my own music since at the moment it is only unknown tracks.

Otherwise I love it and will show it to all my friends ‚úåüèºThere is huge potential to make this game even better. Wow"
4024,Hax,"Jun 2, 2019 at 5:49 PM",5,Sweat inducing fun workout!,"Bought this game to try it out expecting to return it due to reviews about bad tracking.

I find that for the most part, the tracking is quite acceptable. The quest will lose track of your hands if it's too close or out of sight and will make the gloves appear wonky, but it will quickly regain tracking once you punch. It also helps if you put a little distance between your hands and headset when waiting to punch instead of sticking it right to your face.

I think the problem most people are having is due to half hearted punching and timing or at least that's what my problem at first. You have to punch properly and do a full straight quick jab and swing fully when doing hooks and uppers, and it has to be a straight up quick and not a half hearted one like you forgot to have breakfast. Do this and I swear you'll enjoy it better.

Price is a bit steep I think but definitely keeping the game as I can see myself using this quite often."

I thought that i would only use the quest to play beat saber but now I play box vr all the time. But the experience is let down by really bad tracking, and a lot of other small bugs. For now i ignore the tracking bugs and just keep playing, but the developer really needs to work on it. Also it has nothing to do with quest tracking problems, because I see the glove hit the target on screen and it still does not count. restarting the app usually fixes it."
4027,JAMES,"May 26, 2019 at 6:37 AM",3,85% glove tracking 999ms audio hit delay,Super fun game but the audio for punching is very delayed causing the punch sound to become not synchronized with the music.  I am professional musician so my I‚Äôm confident in my timing.  Also the gloves 15% of the time lose tracking and foot in front of face.  Game seems to chug a bit when more than 4-5 punch queues appear on screen.  Still a good game but needs to be refined.
4028,wormslayer44,"Jun 8, 2019 at 12:26 AM",5,Great exercise,The game is well built and works great. The best part about this game is the moment you get lost in boxing it's been an hour. You just need to go all in and forget about your surroundings. The music is also fire. At first when you get into the game the meun a little confusing but you pick it up after a couple games.good luck all you heavyweight champions!
4029,steve.weave.56,"Jun 7, 2019 at 12:09 AM",5,,"The core gameplay is not a million miles from Beat Saber, but the menus and interface are all built around your fitness regime. This is Wii Fit on the Quest. I probably prefer to play Beat Saber, but this is the title I intend to ‚Äúplay‚Äù every day. After all, it will help me justify all the money I spent on the Quest itself. I have difficulty hitting some of the uppercuts for some reason - not sure if it is me or the tracking, but this is only a minor glitch - as I am going for calories burnt rather than high scores. This is a solid title that does what it says and achieves its goals."

The workouts are amazing and I am suffering with the DOMs while i write this. 
It feels so good to be working out on the quest that I will not be going back to my rift to use this app any time soon. I cannot recommend this app enough, if you want to get ripped in VR then buy this app, you will not be disappointed"
4032,NiolK,"Jun 3, 2019 at 1:07 PM",5,Phenomenal workout,"Best workout game on quest by a wide margin. User friendly interface, great selection of workouts, no tracking issues as long as you don't put your hands to close to the headset.

4033,Robert Polk,"Jun 16, 2019 at 2:53 AM",4,Worth buying! Minor issues,"This is a great exercise VR app and I recommend it for people who want to get a bit more cardio or even fit people who are looking for interesting cross training options. The two issues I‚Äôve experienced are, I have some martial arts and boxing experience and my hand positions reflect the positions I was hard wired with. That makes for tracking issues and the Quest looses my hand position if my fists are too close to the head set. I don‚Äôt think most people will experience this as low hand position for those without experience will likely drop their hands. Also, music selection is not there. Not to say it‚Äôs bad. It‚Äôs great for the routines, but you can‚Äôt sample the workout music and the Quest headset speakers can‚Äôt handle the base unless you turn down the volume. I‚Äôm hoping for improvements. It‚Äôs definitely worth buying though."
4034,J,"Jun 23, 2019 at 6:32 AM",2,Tracking and Lag are serious issues,"I love the concept of this game, but there are significant lag and loss of hand tracking issues. I‚Äôve done a lot of boxing, and when throwing hooks or uppercuts, it‚Äôs just impossible to land them on beat due to the lag issues. They just never seem to connect unless you go significantly offbeat which is hard to do. Also, with boxing, the hands should be close to the face (to protect yourself) but when doing that with this game, tracking is consistently lost and the few seconds it takes to get your hands back is jarring. Unless you keep your hands out in front of you, which is contrary to real boxing, it just doesn‚Äôt work. Maybe I‚Äôll try again after improvements are made, but for now, it‚Äôs too troublesome to enjoy. Sorry!"

Is just more difficult like at best saber. U definitly need to hit at the right moment, at the right position... If u are to slow it will not work, if u are to less precise it will not work... In short, more precise and more concentration is necessary

4041,FiestaTony,"Jun 28, 2019 at 6:30 AM",3,Great idea that needs a little work,"I really like the idea of this app, I love beat saber and this is kind of like that with more body movement. That being said there are some tracking and sound issues that need a little work. There‚Äôs a delay with the hit sound that really takes you out of the experience, and the hit tracking on anything other than forward punches can be iffy (maybe increasing the hit box would help). If these were addressed with an update I think it would be an amazing workout app and a cool platform to keep building on."
4042,Jason Dale,"Jun 27, 2019 at 12:55 PM",3,"Good, but not quite right.","I absolutely love this concept or VR exercise - I've played for hours over the last few days and it really does make for a good work out.  I'm a sweaty mess after a few minutes - which is exactly what I wanted.  However, there really is something a very wrong with the timing.  Beat saber is flawless in its 'feel' of timing your swings to the music.  BoxVR just feels wrong.  I have learnt to ignore the beat of the music as its not perceptually matched to the graphics and useless for timing my punches.  It feels unnatural so I have learnt to focus on the graphics and not get distracted by the beat.  A setting to adjust the timing between the graphics and music, even by just a ~few hundred milliseconds might transform the experience for me."
4043,Birb,"Jun 5, 2019 at 2:07 AM",1,Detection is off by almost a full second,"Hitting the targets in this game seems to be at the games will and have very little to do with your form or what you are actually doing, unless it is straight punches which will always register. Fun to get in shape but terrible to actually play beyond a few beyond a few songs because of the frustration level.
Edit: Lowered to one star as the developers suggestion to fix the lackluster tracking is to just ""hold your hands further out"" which will only make playing the game harder and more frustrating."

4051,Russell Morgan,"Jun 20, 2019 at 6:04 PM",3,Bad tracking and collision,"Great software, great concept and a good workout but for the love of God FIX YOUR COLLISION ISSUES! I watch my glove sail through objects several times per session which wrecks the immersion and my attempt at a high score. It's clearly an issue as most of the time the game never even registers the first hit you make.

My guess is you are doing something custom to account for hit speed, direction, etc. So maybe some sort of ""fat gloves"" mode where you increase the hit box size that some of us can activate."
4052,James K,"May 26, 2019 at 11:39 PM",5,Friggin Awesome!!!,"Great boxing simulator game with a  straightforward approach to techniques once understood. And yes there is still quite a bit of quest issues, but am going to continue to add it into my rotation."
4053,Ken Ross,"May 31, 2019 at 10:15 PM",4,Great app with some Quest issues,"I have enjoyed this app on the Oculus Rift for quite some time - it‚Äôs pretty awesome there! I was thrilled to see it was available on Oculus Quest and the fact that I didn‚Äôt have to repurchase it helped push me to buy the Quest. 

The gameplay and visuals overall are great - the developers did a really nice job on porting over the experience from Rift and keeping all the important events in place. However, this IS a boxing game and if you stand in guard position, gloves up and near your face, they‚Äôll lose tracking and just seem randomly placed. It‚Äôs VERY distracting, but doesn‚Äôt stop you from playing - tracking picks up as soon as you move your hand out to punch. 

More than likely this is a mixed issue; probably a limitation of the proximity of the controllers to the headset, as well as the app logic. For example, a work around in the software mingle be to look at the last known track position and if moving towards the visor, default to a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù default guard position instead of it feeling random. 

Hopefully these are just early days growing pains for the platform and refinements to the SDK and application tweaks can resolve these sorts of issues. Overall though, very much recommend this app!"

Very frustrating to miss shots you know should have made contact. I try to keep my form and technique correct to boxing standards but the best way to make sure you hit the crosses and uppercuts seems to be to kindof ""fake"" shots which is unfortunate. I'd rather build a subconscious habit of correct form than get a higher score tbh. The timing of the music and hit markers seems to be a tiny bit off too, which fixing would really help to alleviate the problems mentioned above- I felt I was singing and jabbing at the correct tempo but the hit boxes don't get to you in correct time. I'd gladly give a glowing 5 star review if these issues were polished up a bit. Oh also, some extra stages would be cool"

I felt like I got a full cardio workout without the feeling of doing a chore that most cardio workouts typically gives me. 

Only thing that keeps this from being a perfect 5/5 is that, like other reviews have mentioned, there seems to be a slight tracking issue. I would do the same motion on a combo that had me doing multiple of the same hit and sometimes the glove would disappear and not register the hit. It only happened with the right glove, and was very infrequent. It doesn‚Äôt make this unplayable to me because I mainly wanted it for fitness, but it‚Äôs worth pointing out for people that like to do perfect runs as it might be a deal breaker for them.

4087,Mike,"Jun 3, 2019 at 7:26 PM",2,Could've been a contender...,"Cool game, but the tracking issues and hit detection problems are forcing me to get a refund.

My glove will randomly move around / lose their place even when I'm holding my hands perfectly still directly in front of me & away from my head for the external cameras to see.

Also, half of my hits don't register.  I can see with my eyes that my glove is going THROUGH the target, but it doesn't count as a hit.  I get that my technique/timing might not be perfect, so I'm not expecting a perfect score... but for it to act like I didn't touch it really ruins the immersion (and just makes me frustrated).

I'm hoping the developers can figure out some these issues (that many users are reporting) and then I'd gladly give the game another try.

This is the only game I've even considered refunding so far. :("

4089,wamwam,"May 29, 2019 at 8:45 AM",3,Super fun and super great but...,"(Update 1 - 05/28/19: Ok, after a few days, it's still super fun - that hasn't dissipated. But it's starting to get borderline unplayable as you start to hit the higher paced levels as a movement as simple as winding up to get a swing, the tracking drops, & once you're in rhythm and that happens, you're thrown out of rhythm immediately - not fun in the midst of a deluge you know you're nailing. Anyhow, I may just hold out until the 13th day of my refund period and see if a quick update is released. If not, I'll probably be releasing this game until it's fixed & come back then. I've also regrettably downgraded from 4 to 3 stars for now...PLEASE FIX!)

Original Review: 
The game itself is a LOT fun. Yeah, some might compare it to Beat Saber, and truth be told, the developers would probably be lying if they said they didn't draw at least some inspiration from it, but this is a whole other beast unto itself. It's much more of a workout and had me legitimately sweating and huffing and puffing after several 7 minute rounds (yes, that's a good thing...). 

However, it DOES need some help in the tracking department. 

I don't know if there's a way to utilize a wider angle of the bottom tracking cameras, but the glove gets lost and ultimately end up missing several punches you'd actually land in real life if you move your hands just below eyesight. I know the workaround that's been suggested below is to hold the hands further in front of your face, which absolutely helps in registering landed punches better, but also just as absolutely feels much less natural from a real boxing stance. 

In any case, the game is super fun, and I will be keeping it with the hopes that the tracking issue is somehow resolved in a future update/patch. If that happens to be the case, I've no problem upgrading my review another half star. (Allow me to add my own songs to the playlist so I can do this thing to Run the Jewels or Rage Against the Machine, and that'll be a full star!)"
4090,seb,"Jun 12, 2019 at 11:27 AM",4,Good but needs improvements,It's a good workout however clear hits are sometimes not registered which can break a stride. Very annoying. Bit overpriced.
4091,Dreambird,"Jun 2, 2019 at 4:38 AM",4,Technical Difficulties,"I really like this app, but I experienced three blackouts in the middle of different sessions.  The room went sideways and blacked out, I could still hear audio and see the guardian boundary.   Please fix, and I have to register for app support (?)"
4092,michael.caoile,"Jun 3, 2019 at 3:44 AM",4,Great- but some delay issues,"This game is wonderful and engaging, aside from some audio/visual synchronization issues which add friction to the experience.   I only hope that the audio issues can be resolved soon.  Until then, I can‚Äôt give this a full five star rating."

4094,twistednips,"Jun 17, 2019 at 8:00 AM",3,Unfortunate Tracking for Punches,"I noticed that the punches weren't tracking well, which adds frustration to the repetitive gameplay. Beat Saber is more satisfying for hitting objects coming at you, and Creed for boxing workout."
4095,CoZmicShReddeR,"Jun 5, 2019 at 1:06 AM",3,Issues with gloves,I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a height issue I‚Äôm 6.2 or what but only the straight punches work or track the best and I tried to readjust the gloves just made it worse and I see no way to reset the controllers back to default
