0,Vigilante,14 days ago,5,Much improved! UI + AR + hand tracking,"I tried this when it first came out and was underwhelmed. The UI was not good... the hand tracking was NOT something you'd want to use... and the pass-thru AR was non-existent. My how things have changed! I tried it after the Litesport rebrand and was very surprised at how much better it is now. The UI is much better, you can navigate around easily and everything is intuitive... the hand tracking actually works and works really well, which is very useful when dumbbells... AR pass-thru is amazing (granted I'm using a Quest Pro, which has color and better resolution than the Quest 2)... and they added strength training, so you can use dumbbells, and it shows you what muscle groups you are working. Not yet sure if the premium is worth it, but I'm convinced enough now to try the 7-day trial. Great job to the devs!"
1,Agent M,11 days ago,3,Not mad at them. It's Meta!!!,Be warned: If you do the trial Meta will charge your card bright and early on day 7 and deny you a refund when you try to tell them you just wanted to try the program. I wasn't sure if I wanted to use it often. Now I'm locked in for a year. I hope TikTok finishes kicking meta's crooked a$$! That was so low down and dirty. They didn't give me an option to pay monthly. They just took my money..
2,Liz,Mar 15 at 4:15 PM,4,"I like it, but ...","How to rate Liteboxer? It's kind of tough, because there's actually 2 versions: the free version, and the premium content version. I'll give the free version 5 stars easily, because it's free and it's quite fun. But when I decided to try the Premium version, that's when it sort of fell apart.

It's just a little too expensive for what we get. This costs almost twice as much as FitXR, but I feel like I get more out of FitXR. And maybe the music is better, but there's not nearly enough tracks available in the punchtracks. I really do like the full body workout and the trainer mitt sessions, but once again, I don't see why I have to pay this much for it.

The playlist feature is really great, probably one of my favorite things, to be able to chain together different types of workouts. I wish other apps would incorporate this.

But the most frustrating thing is actually the user interface and the responsiveness of the screen. It's REALLY hard to select things. I have to tap it at just the right speed and withdraw my fingers at just the right time. There was one time it took me 30 seconds of tapping to start a playlist. As a whole, the UI feels clunky and not that intuitive. I can forgive it in the free version, but not the premium version.

I think there's a lot of potential. If they polish the UI (significantly), add a LOT more punch tracks and even more types of activities in the full-body workouts, I think it might be worth the $. I like what I see here, but I'm not willing to pay that much for it, not yet at least."
3,Geofreyg,13 days ago,5,Outstanding,"Blown away….
Finally a VR workout where your not just flaying your arms around hitting targets.  The update is a game changer.  You guys have done an amazing job incorporating weights in a safe, effective and practical manner.

Actually feel like I’m training one on one."
4,Heebs33,Feb 26 at 4:30 PM,5,Still feeling it 3 days later!,I am a 45 year old mother of 4 who most definitely needs to get back into fighting shape and knows what it is going to take to get there! Liteboxer is a great app that will get your blood pumping and your muscles sore!  The instructors tutorials are helpful. The only thing I would recommend is maybe a short tutorial on how to use your core and other muscles to get the best benefits from your workouts! Thank you for creating a "free" and fun app to get us up and moving!
5,Meenimynimo,2 days ago,4,Almost there!,"I was excited about filling out my FitXR cardio with more strength-training oriented workouts so got a Litesport trial. 

The Litesport strength is fun, and the total body is good as well. But I was disappointed with the boxing format compared to FitXR boxercise or actual shadowboxing of TToF. 

Not to diminish from the other two, just would like more quantity/variety there, and is not a good complete cardio replacement yet but does seem like they're working on it.

Oh and the music is great! Lots of fun songs on there.

Finally, especially for strength - would be killer to have adapted and dynamic training programs and not just the individual workouts. The reason I still subscribe to a more holistic strength training site is the programs so we're not overtraining or missing something. If Litesport improves these aspects (more, and some structure) I'll be happy to switch over. 

Looking forward to keeping up with the updates and hopefully making the change eventually!"
6,Brian Anthony,Mar 13 at 4:42 PM,5,Amazing workout!,"I was looking for a way to get some cardio in, in a fun way, and Liteboxer checked all the boxes! I'd never tried a boxing app before and I really enjoyed the way the app was set-up - it was easy to use and the excellent trainers made the workouts fun. I liked the fact that you could choose different workouts based on length and intensity. It's become a staple in my workout routine."
7,Sharktic,Feb 2 at 5:35 AM,5,Fun and Easy Exercise,I just started taking a real interest in my own personal fitness and came across Liteboxer VR when I was looking to do stuff at home. I tried the free version and was absolutely hooked and ended up buying the subscription. It's an easy and fun way to burn calories almost every day and since I've started mixing it into my workout routine I've lost over 20 lbs in about 2 months and the constant flow of new content means it always feels fresh again and again. I can't recommend it enough.
8,Weaver,Jan 15 at 7:35 PM,4,So much more than a boxing app!,"Free version! The total body work outs are wonderful!  Just what I was looking for!  I like boxing, but wanted a bit more of an overall workout… this is perfect!  Might need to rename in some way so people know it isn’t just boxing!  So excited for this program!  I do agree with previous reviewer of adding an option for us to purchase add ons.  Subscriptions are an automatic negative for me. I am not planning on a subscription, but do love the programs!  I’ll just keep the free trial version. Make some additional money by offering add ons!"
9,Emma,Mar 3 at 9:09 PM,5,A workout just from the tutorial!,I did this for the first time last night. I did all the free videos they had (so I think like 4) and I had A LOT of fun with it and now the next day I’m so sore which is an awesome feeling because I know it worked and that I got a good workout form it! I’m looking forward to doing it again tonight !
10,MikeSanchez831,Mar 2 at 4:19 AM,5,Awesome Boxing training,"I always want to join a gym or boxing gym to workout my body and to strengthen my punches, tone my muscles and raise my stamina. When I found this on my oculus I got it right away and I'm glad that I did. It has awesome training courses and hard up beats that give a good work out. I recommend it to you all . From young to old any one can do these awesome training. So why do u all give it a try you won't be disappointed."
11,CaineyP,Jan 16 at 8:16 PM,3,Great but …,"Worked out for the first time last night. Me and my son were sweating by the end of a couple lessons. It’s definitely a good workout and I’ll buy additional in app purchases

From other reviews and playing Beat Saber. It would be nice to buy add ons. Monthly subscriptions can be pricey this day in age. We already paid HUNDREDS for the actual device"
12,Mahindi Masai,14 days ago,1,Does it even work?,This game is completely useless with Oculus 2. If you can get it to work…great. It does nothing for me but freeze and crash. Totally useless!
13,Mark,Dec 4 at 2:02 PM,3,Take my money!,"Here's the problem. Right now, I'm bored with the free stuff, but I don't want a monthly subscription, so let me BUY a new workout.

Right now I'm gonna stop using this cos, bored, and I WANT to give the company MONEY, but there is no way to do this beyond a, frankly, costly subscription model that I don't want, so me, my money, this app, part company. 

Beatsaber does not require a subscription. Beatsaber makes money selling add ons. I want to give you money. You are a company. Make the bit where I give you money an option.

You don't even need to get rid of the subscription option,  just add a third option for individual add ons. Easy."
14,Moly,Jan 25 at 12:46 PM,1,Taking a full year payment is NOT cool,"My wife bought this to use on my meta as part of a to get into shape 

She really liked it and decided to purchase it for £7.99 a month. However I got charged £150 ?!!!!!!???  As she had used a 7 day trial I couldn’t request my money back - so a very naughty tactic in play here 

Thankfully I got onto mega support and they sorted it for me as a gesture of goodwill due to the mistake 

If we could pay monthly, we would pay and keep it, but meta says you do not have that option?"
15,Adem,Mar 2 at 10:06 PM,5,Great workout!,"We got the app through an enjoyment of boxing games on VR, but this game is so much more! We have done full body workouts and the game has got all the family getting up and giving it a go, with great music, atmosphere and clear instructions it is a fabulous app for a workout, even if it's 10 minutes or a longer built up workout."
16,Megan,Feb 23 at 6:00 PM,5,Boxing and more,"I can’t believe the variety that they provide. I initially thought it would just be a boxing program, but was pleasantly surprised to find out that they offer full body workouts as well. I love that they label their workouts/trainings by the number of songs and provide the time. I also love the variety of different music genres they provide. I haven’t come across a trainer yet that I haven’t liked. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone looking for a fun way to get up and moving!"
17,Makipyu,Feb 23 at 2:56 PM,5,This app is great,"I'm easily able to learn a good amount of calories with this, and if you are willing to pay a small fee, you can get a lot more features to it that help you get full body workouts, my favorite to do on here is the box to the beat, I love to play that overall, I say this is a great way to exercise burn calories and have fun"
18,Devine,Feb 25 at 12:30 AM,5,Great workout for me!!,"This game helps me focus and encourages me to get up and move. I love working hard to beat my own score considering I’m not in the greatest of shape. If I get too tired I rest but I do try to complete at least three different training a few times a day. Be sure to have a fan, water and FUN!!"
19,Lilmiss,Feb 22 at 9:21 PM,5,Entertaining and Does the JOB!,"I don't have much motivation or time to work out on a regular basis. I downloaded this app and was skeptical at first. After my first try, I was immediately in love! Not only does it give you a wicked work out, it is actually fun! The time just sails by and you don't even realize it. Well Done Liteboxer! I will be doing the full subscription based on my experience thus far! Totally worth it!"
20,Bryson,Feb 22 at 10:36 PM,5,Best Experience!,"I recently lost 20 pounds and get overwhelmed at a gym. I purchased this set for my family but I needed to set up an account and i clicked on this app out of curiosity, and it has completely changed my daily workout routine, breathing, and all around just a great experience! It has me moving and improving my breathing and building strength!"
21,kurohuku,Feb 21 at 4:32 PM,5,Great instruction,"There are many instructors and full-video instructions. I think this is the No.1 app for instruction. Class construction is so great.
But need more improvement on Hitbox and UI/HUDs. My punches are not recognized and through or ignore targets. UI/HUDs seem 2D like planes, videos too. Mitt Drill instructor videos like 2d video feeling. Some of the classes relay physical Litebox machine eg, grab the machine and stretch, it's bad we can't touch the virtual machine. Hand-tracking is still unstable but it's hardware limit so they are dedicated to implementation. And this app supports LIV.
The basic plan is free. You can play many classes, just try it."
22,diego,Feb 23 at 11:41 PM,5,IF YOU DONT OWN THIS YOUR MISSING OUT,"Not only is this a home workout, but I had a hard time imagining it could supplement my fitness the same way my usual studio workouts do. However, boxing has been gaining popularity as a highly effective personal workout.The best workout for those who hate actual physical working out"
23,Pagans1213,Feb 23 at 9:17 PM,5,Very fun app for the whole family,"This app is great for adults and kids, my kids love to play to challenge themselves and it's a great way to get a quick workout. Easy way to be active while being inside. The free version is great we are going to get the full version to see how much more fun we can have with it!"
24,Erika,Feb 4 at 12:36 AM,5,LOVE THIS PROGRAM,"I LOVE this program.  I am brand new to VR, and am probably THE least motivated person on the planet.  So, finding this program has been awesome!  It's varying lengths of workouts, which is great if you only have 5 min until the kids wake up, etc. It is fun, it is easy to learn and use (I'm old, I need help), and I really love that the stats are displayed for you each time.  I HIGHLY recommend this!"
25,Ben Moynihan,11 days ago,4,Really Good,"Really good and a good price too for what you get.

Only niggle is that it doesn’t look like there is a way of changing the weights from lb to kg."
26,nutterbutter,Feb 23 at 6:28 AM,5,This Truly Saved My Life!!!!,Ok let me start by saying thank you last March my Mother died of a heart attack. No goodbyes or I love you just gone forever. I was just over eating daily didn't care lying around dying daily. For Christmas I got both my son's the quest oculist 2 VR SETS. THO EXSPENSIVE  WHEN I USED it for first time I was blown away.Then I found  LITEBOXER this game saved my life. Gave me a reason to get off  my butt and find the man that I was n more. It's challenging and pushes you to do better every time. I'm now a better man than I ever was my cardio is insane my love life well let's say my wife loves the game alot lol. If you need any reason to get back your get back try LITEBOXER it's a life changing game. Thanks LITEBOXER you saved my life better man father partner Sincerely Will Snively SR
27,Connie J,Feb 28 at 5:33 PM,4,Great workout for a newbie,"This workout is a great workout and really made me sweat! I felt it in my arms, shoulders and legs for several days after my initial workout and find myself looking forward to the next workout. While I have not yet committed to the subscription, I may need to at least do the trial to see what other workouts are there but think the $14.99 monthly fee may not be worth it in the long run.  I like the workouts with the trainers as it keeps me motivated with their encouragement and the free versions don’t offer many options with the trainers so I’m feeling forced to pay if that is the only way I’ll have more options and not get bored with the few workouts that are free."
28,Forma,Feb 26 at 9:25 PM,5,Love a workout app with AR,"I don't have much space on my gameroom, so be able to use AR to workout it's a must, works awesome even on a quest 2. I'm sweating without the fear of breaking something. Missing some Luis Miguel songs, but other than that, it's a great workout app."
29,Kathleen,13 days ago,5,Kathleen,Excellent work out program. Many varieties! Fun! Great music! Definitely recommend!
30,Cat,Mar 2 at 1:48 AM,5,Love it!,I’m new to gaming and bout the Meta Quest Teo for exercise. I downloaded Liteboxer and LOVE IT! Love how realistic it is and the ‘real life’ trainers. It really makes you work up a sweat! Buy it … you won’t be disappointed
31,Crystal,Feb 3 at 6:12 PM,4,"Game good, pricing bad","I personally enjoy target games that use regular main stream music. Listening to upbeat and fun music seems to be the best motivator for me to stay committed to a game. I've tried Supernatural, Beat Saber, Audio Trip and LiteBoxer. 
I am concluding Supernatural aligns best for me. The price is similar $179 for annual membership but I've never heard the same song twice in that app. They also offer boxing, targets, stretching and I believe yoga. I never have to buy any expansion packs for more music or workouts. New content is uploaded daily.
Beat Saber is fun, purchased once, but only includes about 30-40 songs, most of them I hate, none of them are familiar to me outside of the game. But you can purchase expansion packs for more music. I like that Beat Saber has the online community where you can compete with other people. 
Audio Trip comes with about 30-40 songs as well. It also comes with a virtual fitness tracker watch that you can view while working out. You can download an app on your phone and it will put all of your work out data on the app as well. But after beating the beginner level I was disappointed to find out it didn't unlock new songs for me. That's when I started to try out LiteBoxer.
LiteBoxer is really fun but I try to keep away from games that charge monthly and I couldn't really try enough to commit to purchasing an annual subscription. Supernatural gives a full 7 days free trial completely unbridled with full functionality of the game. All that being said, I think I'm just going to stick to my first choice. The only part that annoys me with Supernatural is the trainers talk too much. I'd like if they STFU so I can just focus on the music lol"
32,Tracy,Mar 1 at 5:56 AM,5,Addictive and enjoyable,"I find I am almost immediately ready to try to beat my last score. I love that I don't have to move too fast , as I am still recovering from a major surgery last summer I addition to a chronic illness. This is still challenging and fun."
33,Tash,Feb 23 at 6:34 PM,5,Love the app! Get paid you won’t regret!,"Been using this app for a week now and I love it! So easy to use, display is great and it gives a great workout!!! Loads of songs to choose from and trainer workouts too; the large variety keeps it fresh every session. Play this at least 3 times a day!"
34,Jorge Mata Jr.,Feb 23 at 5:30 PM,5,Pretty great start,"New to VR and wanting to try everything it has to offer, checked out Liteboxer and had a lot of fun with it. Punch tracks are great, the full body workouts were fun too. I'll be subscribing to a premium membership to get the full experience. Thank u"
35,Henry,Feb 24 at 2:02 AM,5,really good work out,i have the free version…so i was looking for a work out that i could do with my herniated disc in my back! so happy i found this i havent even tried everything but i “play” everyday for about 30 mins and i am sweating when im done! i love it!
36,fjpfjp,Feb 24 at 9:46 AM,4,Karate black belt got sore muscles 👍🏻,"I hold a Karate black belt, do barefoot running and consider myself a sporty and fit person. I only use the free version of the App but the exercises really have a punch (pun intended). After the days I used it, I really felt some sore muscle ache, partly in body parts which I didn’t even know they exist. Of course, new movements in a different way cause the body to react, even if the body is properly trained. Altogether I can say that if you really immerse yourself into the exercises, you will definitely sweat, get out of breath, and your body reacts. It’s really a workout, not some wimpy game movements, but at the same time it’s fun!

I second the suggestion of many others to offer exercise packs besides the subscription model, just like the music packs in Best Saber (-1 star for that)."
37,Jen,Feb 24 at 4:16 AM,4,Fun way to workout,"I've enjoyed this app so far.  Unlike others where you might get a quick demo, LB offers enough free content that you can get a feel for all it has to offer.   The workouts are interesting and keep you engaged. My only complaint is it can be really glitchy at times.  Sometimes it works great and other times, I have to restart 5+ times to get it working."
38,Istikhar,Mar 1 at 5:39 PM,5,Good,I like this because I don't like doing exercise but vr has made it more fun and now I like doing and I am trying to do this twice a week and I like it and I would definitely recommend it to all of people who play vr
39,Keliel23,4 days ago,2,No access,I. Guess the “Basic” is a bait and switch. Can’t edit my profile are workout.  Very disappointed
40,VikaStorm,Feb 27 at 4:31 PM,5,Free version,I can’t really afford to pay for a subscription soon stick with the free version and I use this app at least theee times a day to supplement my workout routine. It makes working out more fun that it used to be for me
41,tiff,Feb 23 at 12:07 AM,4,Cool concept,"I have only tried this game out a few times, but I really like it so far. It's a really cool concept and different from the other apps I've seen. I'm only doing the free version right now, but may subscribe in the future. The only issue I have is trying to hit the buttons. All of the continue, start workout, go back, etc. are a pain in my butt. I try lightly touching then, going so the way through, double-tapping, holding them down, and it takes forever for them to work, even though they're showing they're being pushed down and make a clicking noise. That's my only complaint with the app, but it really drives me nuts. Otherwise, a good boxing app!"
42,Ada,Feb 28 at 10:48 PM,5,Great sweat,This is definitely my favorite even the free version will have you sweating and sore for days. Perfect for all levels a fun workout out with out feeling like you’re working out. I definitely recommend this one.
43,Reincarnation cc,Feb 22 at 9:05 PM,5,Suprised in a good way,"I was sceptical first seeing the ads about this VR Game.
But it is very nice and highly motivating.
I now use it often as cardio instead of on the treadmill or stationary bike. 
Haven't tried the full version yet due to the monthly price"
44,Aj,Feb 24 at 5:04 PM,4,,The free stuff is great but it’s the same 3 or 4 workouts that we have access to. I feel like there should be more free content for users who don’t want to spend more money on the app when people have spent hundreds on the console. Other than that the app is a great workout
45,Diana,Feb 27 at 3:56 AM,4,Really cool..!!,"I love this game so far, the trainings are great and it’s really fun and amazing workout, my only complaint is that the paid version is a bit pricey, I wouldn’t want to be paying that much each month, It would be great if you could come up with a different model."
46,Rory,8 days ago,5,I have 6 pack now,This help so much
47,Summers,Feb 23 at 5:40 AM,4,A fun and easy way to move!,This has been a fun and easy way to incorporate move my in my day. Easy to follow and modify to my personal comfort. Would love to see the possibility of add on purchases instead of monthly subscription. Love the free version but not ready to add another subscription at this time.
48,Meagan,Feb 22 at 9:38 PM,5,I use this app daily,I use this app daily in my workout their whole body workouts are a great way to warm up for you whole workout. It's fun and easy to keep up with! Would recommend this product to anyone needing a new app to workout with.
49,greg,Feb 28 at 3:24 AM,5,Love it,Although I wish I had enough money for the premium the free version is good I Especially like doing the punch tracks and trainer classes and it doesn't hurt that the ladies are nice looking too
50,Splatbeyonce128,Feb 24 at 2:50 AM,4,some problems i have with this app.,"its nice, i like it. Really gets thw sweat outta ya but the premium... yeesh 1. too expensive. 2. why put some items and workouts behind a paywall, its not right. 3. the design of the whole thing seems old timey. So yeah, thats what i have to say. but great app though!"
51,Emmett,Mar 1 at 4:22 AM,5,Loads of fun,Really like the music and the workouts. I’m pretty competitive so I like that there are scores for how well you did. I can either try to beat my previous score or someone else’s.
52,Pearceo628,Feb 14 at 8:04 AM,5,Lite boxer is THE BEST!!!!,"I have had liteboxer for only a month and I am loving it. Their full body workouts are better than the gym and the mid sessions are magnificent. I only use the free plan and it’s better quality than any paid for workout. 10/10, would definitely recommend"
53,Logan,Feb 28 at 9:26 PM,5,LOVE IT!,This has by far been the best workouts that I have had on the oculus especially considering you can do a lot for free! The paid version also adds a ton of flexibility and perks!
54,The Weirdly Amused,Mar 9 at 5:24 AM,5,fun to work out,liteboxer has made it fun to work out and i love it. The hand tracking makes it like real boxing and dont need to use the controllers
55,Choley,Mar 3 at 9:50 PM,4,Love it so far!,"I have the free version right now but the full body workouts are enough to make you want to buy the advanced version! It really is a good app to have especially if you are trying to get in shape, or back in shape."
56,Edwina,Feb 3 at 12:58 AM,5,Great boxing exercise,I really like the game the only down is that it cost a month;-( There is so many applications I like and they also charge monthly subscription.Otherwise it’s a great boxing experience I used to play fit xr but I can tell Honestly that this one is much better I will for sure but the subscription maybe not for every month
57,Alex,Feb 2 at 12:02 AM,5,The Best App Ever,From the first time I started this app I have been getting my butt kicked  with each workout. This is one of the best workout app ever and with it being on the oculus make it a game changer I told everyone who I know that this should be the first app  purchased when on Oculus. I say Keep it going and the music hits different  I love it

Liteboxer appears to be a VR rhythm-based boxing game that allows players to physically punch and dodge along to the beat of popular music tracks. The game has received positive reviews for its immersive experience and its use of full-body movement to enhance the workout experience. Some players have also praised the game for its variety of difficulty levels and for being an enjoyable way to stay physically active."
59,Kris,Feb 1 at 9:58 PM,5,From a non-boxer,"I love this app!
The trainers are fun and even with the ‘basic’ package they have personality and make every workout or mitt drill fun!
GW and JD are my favorite. I have to remind myself I’m not in the gym with them sometimes when I catch myself laughing or really getting into the groove.
It doesn’t feel like a trainer with forced motivation - it’s like fooling around with friends, getting a good workout, and seeing the leaderboards to throw in a little competition as well.

5 star recommend.
Oh, can use with hand tracking too if you don’t like holding the controllers - I thought that was neat."
60,George,Mar 3 at 9:10 PM,4,Great workout,"Great workout, either all over body or just arms. Gets you motivated and moving really enjoyable, great way to work out at home.
Sucks that you have to pay monthly for premium to use most of the game content"
61,Got em,Feb 23 at 9:24 PM,4,It's pretty good!,"If you're looking for a way to get started on your fitness journey, I think this is a great way to do it. I've been in boxing/ training for over a year and I definitely see some crossover between the two. The only limitations is the headset itself"
62,Freya,Feb 28 at 12:37 PM,5,Amazing,I recently got a VR and started to use LiteBoxer to get my daily workout in - I loved in so much I have upgraded to premium and it is absolutely worth the money!
63,Danny,Feb 20 at 8:37 AM,2,Amazing but costly,"What an awesome way to hammer out a workout. I am content with the free version but 18/mo for premium is great if you are living on money. I’d hope they would drop the price to 8-10 a month. 

Edit:

Used to work. Now it just stops at the main screen. It’s a great app, when it works."
64,Sara Treen,Mar 9 at 5:39 AM,5,Awesome app,The free version is very nice.  There’s lots of workouts to try. It simple to follow and gets you a great workout.
65,Seangmenzies87,Feb 22 at 9:24 PM,5,Best boxing fitness app!,"This app exceeds expectations. The workouts are really easy to follow, and the trainers are a great help. Love the choice of music for the different activities! Would really recommend."
66,Maanders,Feb 24 at 3:13 AM,5,Good work out,I’m a newbie for exercise and found this very enjoyable! I was sweating by the end of a 15 minute work out! Will recommend to everyone! And keep it up every day to stay active!
67,Nics Laidlaw,Feb 3 at 9:27 PM,5,New found love,"I found this to be great for helping me to get fit and lose weight. I do 3 or 4 of them a day...... just would like to change one thing..... I would like to see more options instead of the same six on the front..... otherwise, I love it and have lost 7lb in a month....Thank you"
68,richlynnwatson,Feb 11 at 5:34 PM,5,Surprisingly great,"I am enjoying this app much more than I thought I would. Even without the subscription, there are great workouts to choose from and they will really make you sweat. Going to give the free trial a go and may even signup for this one."
69,Suave,Feb 22 at 9:10 PM,5,Awesome Game & Experience,"This game is awesome.  Just started playing it, but I'm hooked.  Got my wife on it as well. I trained in boxing, and this game gives you a full experience.  5 out of 5"
70,Gary,Feb 23 at 1:46 AM,5,Lite boxing,"Great workout easy to get up to a sweat. Punch as hard and fast as you want or can. Looking forward to using this app more. Lots of options for free.
Nice job guys"
71,Xenon,Feb 3 at 5:30 PM,5,Music for freestyle?,"The content is great and I really enjoy the app. I like that I can compete with thousands of other people or just my friends who enjoy boxing as much as I do, I just wish there was more music options for free mode or a small selection of music for freestyle."
72,Layla,Feb 1 at 9:09 PM,5,Great app,"I’ve just started but love this app.  There are so many different exercises to do.  You will not get bored.  It’s great to have different speed options also.  The only issue would be, it would be nice to have different genres of song options to work out to."
73,EPonce94,Feb 11 at 9:51 AM,3,Great. But at a cost.,This app is very great. Variety of workouts to get the heart rate going and a fun way to work up a sweat. A decent track list to go with your workouts. I've been using the trial so far and I've enjoyed it. My downfall is the price of the premium membership.
74,Levi,Feb 10 at 1:43 PM,5,awesome experience,I recently just tried out light boxer on my Sons oculus and it was much more than I expected I had a lot of fun me and him tried to beat each other's high scores plus it's a great little Work out for my son also
75,Jascurtis66,Feb 25 at 9:15 PM,5,Enjoyable,Great variety of workout on this app so you can get it done in your own home without all the expensive equipment! Fully recommend this.
76,Jazzy,Feb 4 at 11:19 PM,4,I like it a lot,I really needed to start working out but I would rather have just bought app like beat saber and purchased ad ons when I want. So personally I have to switch to beat saber when I'm bored with the free plan to get some exercise but I do love the concept I even tell my friends and family about it .
77,MamaO,Feb 4 at 12:07 AM,4,A great way to workout!,"I love that you have a personal trainer right there with you showing and telling you what to do.  They are very encouraging and help you keep going, even when its tough.  I like that it focuses on ither part of the body and not just your arms.  I would give it 5 stars but Im new to it and still trying to figure out what workouts will work for me.  Im a beginner and there arent many easy levels from what I can tell.  It also seems like there arnt many choices and I dont understand the options on the right hand if the screen but I will figure it out.  The music is great!"
78,Neo,Feb 3 at 9:34 PM,4,"So far, so good!","It’s early days into the app but as of now really enjoying the free sessions on the app. 

Rather than needing a subscription to get more addons, would be better if you had a section where you can just purchase individual sessions to add to the catalogue. But so far, I’ve no complaints about the app."
79,Kenneth,Feb 1 at 10:07 PM,5,love it so far!,"Im only doing the basic package so far, but enjoying it so much!!  I only wish it wasnt subscription based and just a one time fee.  If funds wernt tight though, id pay for the subscription.  We'll see in the future!  Thank you for a great fitness app!"
80,Tosh.O,Mar 1 at 1:25 AM,4,Free Version,"I really enjoy boxer, it's a great workout. I was definitely sore the next day lol I just wish the free version had a few more workouts available. Think I'll purchase though."

0culus c0m / appreferrals /Antilynx95 /4175028349266073 /"
82,RHH,Feb 2 at 9:09 PM,4,It's fun....but,"I really enjoy the punch tracks and the wide selection of music. However, it's very hard to get instructions to find out how streaks work and also to determine if hitting the target's harder actually increases your power or increases your score. Some of the trainer would courses are very difficult to use especially when the trainers are right in front of the target, that makes it very hard to actually see where you're hitting and it's a huge distraction"
83,Tierra,Feb 3 at 5:46 PM,5,Great workouts!,"I had supernatural last year and really liked it but I LOVE Liteboxer!  I gave up my subscription to Supernatural for Liteboxer instead.  Great workouts, it is like you are really there with the trainers and the music tracks are awesome!"
84,Lasonta,Dec 14 at 3:59 AM,1,Why are we paying for 2 subscriptions,I was noticing that you can log in and get a subscription through your meta quest account but then when I was playing the game I had no features when I had just opted into their 30 days free and 18 $19 after that. Then I'm checking out the reviews and someone was pointing out some pros and cons and noticed that there is a subscription on the light boxer website also that's $159 a year. So why take people's money knowing that what they believe in a subscription from you all is going to be the full length game and workouts and not saying that there is a whole nother website to go to and get really get into the workouts?
85,Cody,Feb 24 at 9:29 PM,5,Love the app,The app is awesome. I have not subscribed yet but I’m really thinking about it. Even the basic plan offers so much. It’s awesome for working out.
86,skydunker,Feb 1 at 9:46 PM,4,Liteboxer,"Liteboxer is a good way to enjoy your workout.  It does a good job of keeping track of your workout stats, but it does not let you go back and look at your stats for specific days which is a bummer.  The subscription is pretty expensive.  Would be nice to see a micro transaction model be implemented along with the subscription to make it more affordable for everyone.  But if you have the subscription liteboxer is incredibly fun and addicting."
87,Superstar,Feb 1 at 11:59 PM,4,Excellent workout,"I love the boxing with a trainer model.  Other boxing games I have purchased don't include this option.  The workouts are really good and the music is fun.   So far, I'm still using the free content.  I appreciate that they offer this as an option.   I'll probably upgrade to the subscription once I get bored with the free content."
88,KarastinJean,Feb 1 at 10:50 PM,4,Amazing Work Out!,I don't work out often not have I ever boxed trying to get a little healthier I stumbled upon this app and I absolutely love it! I've used it everyday this month and I wish there was more free workouts or a way to just buy a few I can't afford a membership but I would love a little more and wouldn't mind paying for a little more when needed.
89,Pepe,Feb 3 at 12:51 AM,4,"Very nice features, but…","I really enjoy the app, I think it keeps you motivated and engaged. The thing I do not like so much is not having options for new workouts unless you subscribe. I undersgan it cannot be all for free, but maybe offer a couple of workout packages for a one time fee, like other games and apps do."
90,Bebo,Mar 2 at 9:38 PM,5,Amazing,First time trying this with my kids. We lived it. The music motivates you too go to the beat!!!
91,Ashley DesChenes,Feb 23 at 9:40 PM,5,Love this app,The trainers make you feel like you’re in a real class and it doesn’t even feel like a workout because it’s fun to play
92,Joey,Feb 26 at 10:12 PM,4,Dancehall wanted,I am really enjoying the app and have signed up for the subscription. Although I am gutted as I wish there were ore dancehall songs on there to get me in the mood more
93,Craig,Feb 6 at 4:26 PM,4,Amazing Free!!,They offer a lot for absolutely no cost. The workouts are great and actually very fun and detailed. My only issue is that the targets dont always register when hitting them. I'm new to VR so maybe that's the way she goes or something can be updated in the app itself.
94,Wyldbit,Feb 4 at 2:31 AM,4,Its getting better an better!,"UPDATE 2: It deserves 4 stars now. Good workouts, better graphics, trainers are good and varieties in the gameplay. It really makes fun and give a good workout. The subscription is a thing i personally don't like, but the game has gone a long way from 1/2 stars to 4 stars now. Well made! 

OLD: I like the music and the graphics are ok… but the gameplay is very basic - only the device you box at. That's all, that is the whole game! It's boring, under average, no variety. It's like a rhythm whack-a-mole game without the moles. I tried a few ""hard"" workouts, but they are not hard either and I didn't sweat, it's far from a full workout.

UPDATED 1: Now with the free BASIC membership I give this game 3 stars.

OLD: This costs a very expensive membership subscription! What's the benefit? Is there anything I don't see? More variety? I would consider to buy it for 5 to 10 USD (onetime) and play it maybe sometimes for warm-up. There are very many and far better (and much cheaper) alternatives for the Quest 2 if you like boxing or workouts."
95,eeveeee,Feb 24 at 4:11 AM,4,Much more than a game.,This app is really helpful if you want to get in shape and learn to box while you are at it. It is fun and very interactive plus you do not have to pay of you do not want to. 9/10
96,Kristina,Feb 28 at 3:16 AM,4,Boxing Exercise,It's a great workout.  Can do a short workout or a long workout depending on the time you have.  I do the boxing on my days off from the gym.  Would recommend.
97,Michael Jongsma,Mar 3 at 9:38 PM,5,,I really like this game. It gives me a good workout and it helps me lose weight.
98,Lolo,Mar 4 at 6:08 AM,5,LOVE IT,Seriously absolutely love this app I use it like three times a day so far ❤️
99,Mrnymbis,Feb 26 at 11:06 PM,5,Great workout,I love the app i get a great workout in everytime i use it I like that the instructors teach you as well
100,Isytristan,Feb 2 at 8:58 PM,4,Its fun,I'm using the basic liteboxer membership and I feel good after playing it. I would love to get more content but I can't do a membership. I think it would be better if you offered bundles or something like that so people can expand their workouts when they have the funds available.
101,Finley Bray,Mar 13 at 7:34 PM,1,,Never got past the first screen - had to create a profile and none of the buttons worked
102,Keira,Feb 24 at 11:05 AM,5,Great workout!,This app is fantastic for getting you moving and really gets you sweating! Its fantastic and really motivating!
103,Mario,Feb 19 at 10:09 PM,1,worst ever,The only thing worse than the app is to try to cancel the monthly subscription. There are directions that don’t have the button to cancel. And the exercise programs are only squats. no variety.
104,AndyMan,Feb 27 at 12:39 AM,5,New,Very easy to use. Trainers are easy to follow. Workout is as difficult as you want it to be.
105,DARKMANI0,Feb 2 at 11:21 PM,5,Updates for people without subscription!,"People without subscription should get more songs and more benefits, so more players could join, the community could expand! It's just an opinion (idea) that I have on my head, if the game can have more it's ok"
106,TeamTNT,Feb 2 at 3:57 PM,5,I love this app for me and my son,My son and I are both using this app and boy let me tell you for a couple of really big guys this is a heck of a workout. Right now we use the free version but starting soon we will be subscribing for sure.
107,LordlyDread,Feb 2 at 3:42 AM,5,Great app!,"It’s a great app with a stellar concept, it may be my headset (oculus quest 1) but I have some issues some times with the hands not registering correctly. Besides that, it’s a great game and keeps me moving"
108,Harshit Maheshwari,Feb 23 at 1:21 AM,5,Pretty decent,Get me a good workout. Just hoped that there were more variety of sparring sessions. Pretty decent though
109,Phil,Feb 20 at 3:54 PM,1,"Overpriced, buys reviews","Basic app is ok but limited, premium is insanely overpriced. Also offer vouchers for good reviews (which they don't then send out), so you can't even trust any positive reviews."
110,David Reis,Feb 23 at 9:08 PM,5,Nice app for training,"Very nice app to workout, different types of training with different coaches, i recommend 👍"
111,CHRISHAYWOOD77,Feb 21 at 1:13 AM,5,Exceptional,"Exceptional, but won't sign up for a subscription.   An option to purchase individual sessions or 24 hours would be nice.  Otherwise I love using the free access options."
112,Riley jay,Mar 2 at 9:06 PM,5,Awesome,So easy to log on and do it's a great way to work out
113,Funone,Mar 2 at 5:00 AM,5,"Great, work out",Great aerobic workout Super fun to watch your progress.
114,Miige,Feb 3 at 10:42 PM,3,Enjoy but,I 100% enjoy this app the work outs are great but I think you should be able to buy additional work outs instead of paying for a monthly membership
115,Joey Joey,Mar 3 at 7:54 PM,5,Best boxing workout,Love the work out. But the price is high.
116,Sheena Baker,Feb 1 at 9:19 PM,5,workout,"the first time I tried this I thoroughly enjoyed and burned some calories. by the 2nd or 3rd day, my thighs were telling me i had quite a workout. it’sa fun way to get toned and slim down"
117,Infinite,Mar 3 at 6:14 PM,5,Love it,Such an awesome app I use it everyday
118,Nikki S,Feb 1 at 9:04 PM,5,Way more of a workout than anticipated,So I wanna say I absolutely LOVE all of the variety of song. Even beat saber can't compete there. Second no other VR game has given me such a full body workout. Just do it. Get the game
119,Jace,Feb 23 at 10:55 PM,5,Great Workout,I am feeling muscles that I haven't felt in a while. I recommend this app!
120,PhilippV,Feb 22 at 10:14 PM,5,Best VR Boxing App,"This App is very good in: performance, quality and gaining Boxing skills."
121,Tezzy,Feb 22 at 10:11 PM,5,I can do this all day,Great workout for me. Love the music love the trainers very inspirational
122,Janee,Feb 22 at 9:23 PM,5,Lite boxing,I love the lite boxing. I play lite boxing every morning for a workout.
123,Matt Snyder,Mar 3 at 10:09 PM,5,Great app,Fun app beats going to gym
124,TeeMac,Feb 23 at 10:59 AM,4,Lite version,I love it especially the hip hop workout one.. A nice little slight workout from the comfort of your own home.. highly recommend
125,Nikolay Alaister,Jan 26 at 3:55 PM,3,Immersive Experience,"I love the fast-paced mini workouts with real personal trainers. The LiteBoxer app allows me to get high quality workouts from home, without having to go to the gym. I love that you get to choose your personal trainer, to workout with. The trainers are really motivated, high energy, and helpful."
126,Iceman,Feb 1 at 9:28 PM,5,This App is amazing!!!,I've been really enjoying this app. Liteboxer has a free and paid version. I have been using the free version. It runs smoothe and gives you a great cardio workout.
127,RC,Feb 2 at 2:20 AM,5,Nice cardio,Started a neutrino regimen and vr work out at the same time.  I’ve lost 60 pounds in under 3 months…. I love Lite Boxer VR…. I box every night before bed!!!!
128,Nikki,Feb 22 at 9:58 PM,4,Fun but...,"I really like the game, the workoits are good, but i dont want a subscription. I would buy seperate workout packs."
129,Dylan Leon,Feb 22 at 10:09 PM,5,Awesome,Great for a quick workout. Love the trainer led classes.
130,D-Nice,Feb 22 at 9:44 PM,5,get right,i love the fact i feel like im getting personal lessons
131,Amir,Mar 6 at 1:08 AM,1,Worst game,"This is the worst game ever because it doesn’t even work

￼"
132,List en Bedrog,Feb 3 at 9:10 AM,5,amazing,"I downloaded it a few days ago and im loving it.
Found a way to use this as a workout, i added this to my morning routine. great way to start the day."
133,Kory,Feb 1 at 9:14 PM,5,Really good,I like this game because it is easy to understand and its like a  competition because you want to score the highest to get to the top of the leader board
134,Sarah Elizabeth Marquez,Feb 23 at 2:49 AM,5,Great Workout!!!!,Awesome workout! Great music! Great trainers!
135,Pierre,Feb 2 at 2:42 AM,5,,The app is fun and also helps with losing weight as well you can see how many calories you have lost during a workout in all and I really like it
136,Stakaya,Nov 4 at 1:21 AM,5,Free version,"I just started with the free version and love it, although I kinda feel like being able to buy music or music packs would be a great opttion..something simular to beat sabre with how you can buy individual songs and whole packs from an artist would increase playability. Being able to buy like a workout pack with intense music would be awesome."
137,Anthony,Feb 2 at 12:04 AM,4,"Good, just a bit expensive for me","They've gone for the peloton business model but I think a beat saber model would be more appropriate. I'd rather spend £10 for a rock music pack, than pay an ongoing subscription for all the workouts."
138,Kevin,Feb 22 at 9:15 PM,4,Good workout,I have been using the app a few days now and  I  can feel it in my muscles that it is working.
139,Peyton Bess,Feb 2 at 10:03 PM,5,Really fun way to stay active!,"I have a hard time sticking to working out most of the time, but after work I actually look forward to getting on this and being active!"
140,Zain,Feb 24 at 3:40 PM,4,great work out,this app is amazing..has your whole body in motion. great sweat with a fun workout
141,Max,Feb 6 at 1:06 AM,5,Good app,It's a good app to work out too. I do two sessions in the morning in two sessions at night and it's been working great
142,Heath,Feb 22 at 11:42 PM,5,,I enjoy the music and exercises!
143,Ben Kovler,Feb 13 at 5:09 PM,4,Great but...,Great workout but limited in free mode. The lack of hand tracking in full body workouts is disappointing as the controllers can be a bit clunky especially on the speed bag.
144,Gatorbait83,Feb 1 at 10:56 PM,5,Love it,I love it because on a lot of workout apps you have to buy it to play it but on this you can use the app without buying anything.
145,Nic,Oct 4 at 9:38 AM,5,free version is a great option,"with enough variation to keep you interested the lite version is great to get to grips with the app and get a workout that actually feels like you're doing a workout, plus punching invisible things is a great stress reliever! :) 
I imagine if you wanted boxing to form a core part of your work out you might want to pay for the premium version to allow you to mix things up more but for a casual user the lite version is pitched just right."
146,Gold1122,Feb 2 at 12:09 AM,5,Amazing,Great music and workouts. Once you start is difficult to stop and  you do 30 minutes without being tired.  Love how the trainer explain  the movement and the music is great.
147,Profound,Feb 24 at 1:32 PM,5,Fun,Very Fun app
148,angels9195,Feb 6 at 11:45 PM,5,Love this app,I totally love the workout I get from liteboxer and I have recommended this app to several people now
149,Shannon,Feb 1 at 9:39 PM,5,Amazing!!,I love how they put the boxing to music you know. It doesn't feel like a workout at all but the next day I definitely feel it!
150,Jissa,Jan 18 at 6:19 PM,5,BEST BOXING GAME EVER,This game had me moving! I absolutely enjoy playing this in my spare time. I would 100% recommend to anyone who likes boxing or wants to get fit! Best boxing game to get fit on the meta quest.
151,Sarah Liles,Feb 1 at 9:08 PM,5,50lbs and counting!,This has become my main workout on my recent health journey. Currently 50lbs down and credit a large portion to Liteboxer!
152,Lee,Feb 26 at 1:47 AM,3,Ok,It is ok but repetitive and not as intense as some other fitness apps.
153,mortimer,Feb 2 at 7:30 PM,5,Great app,This app has become part of my daily fitness routine. Really enjoying the mitt drills and punch tracks.
154,Carolyn,Feb 1 at 9:50 PM,5,GOOD!,I have been using this application for several weeks and I have noticed a change in my physical activity!
155,Miguelandhell,Feb 3 at 1:53 AM,5,Amazing experience,"You can almost feel every punch with your trainer, and with great fun, this is an amazing experience"
156,Victoria,Feb 3 at 3:01 AM,4,Great relief from the gym... for now!,I like the convenience of it being right in the house.  It actually feels like working with a trainer.  The music has also been good.  I'm sold so far!!
157,Stef,Feb 22 at 9:15 PM,4,,"Lots of fun, very informative on how to do things."
158,Alex,Feb 5 at 9:57 PM,4,It's ok,"Have tried this game. Has a basic, then 2 purchase levels.
Minimum choice of excersises on basic but can't complain the basic is free to use"
159,Rewdan,Feb 1 at 9:14 PM,5,Great fun and a bit of a work out,Really enjoyed this was great fun and got me very competitive definitely will be using this more.
160,LaLo,Jan 9 at 6:18 PM,2,Need more subscription offers,I enjoy doing the punch tracks. However with basic it is only 10 songs and the premium plan is not worth it for me because I can live without the trainer option. I would purchase subscription if it was a punch track only option that is less then the premium. Guess I'm stuck to the basic plan.
161,Dan.T.,Feb 2 at 9:18 PM,4,Starting workouts,This is a great program when you are starting out in boxing. The beginners are good warm up before moving on to the more strenuous 10 minute cycles
162,Devin Muir,Feb 2 at 9:04 PM,4,Awesome game but one problem,This is super fun and has a bunch of really good workouts. Just wish there were more workout options without having to pay $19-$25 CAD every month.
163,Itsme88,Feb 1 at 9:06 PM,5,Great workout,"Lite boxer is perfect for your workouts. Fun, easy and just right. Would definitely recommend"
164,Dustin,Feb 2 at 3:55 PM,5,Love it,I love Liteboxer. I keep coming back to it daily. I love how it gamifies me working out.
165,Kasey Denny,Feb 2 at 3:52 AM,5,Love it!,Absolutely love this app! It’s fun and keeps me wanting more!! Definitely would recommend!

170,Solomon Jackson,Feb 2 at 9:49 PM,5,Love this app!,Is app is very effective my favorite is the two song total body workout.
171,Nene,Oct 23 at 10:27 PM,5,I love it,"I love the workout out on this I haven't played anything that makes me sweat like this game does, I feel the pain afterwards as though I have done a full body workout in the gym, I wish it was a little more for the free version or a little cheaper per month for the subscription thats about all I have as a con other than that its a really good workout game, 5 stars for  sure👍"
172,Safiyah,Feb 10 at 9:55 PM,5,Great Workout,This app is the BOMB!!
173,CrimsonCandy,Feb 1 at 9:08 PM,5,Love it,"I love this app, wish ot wasnt subscription but its still great"

175,Jennhenrykhloe,Feb 2 at 1:25 AM,5,Makes ya sweat,What a great workout! Really gets the heart pumping!
176,Josh Bartok,Feb 1 at 9:37 PM,5,Fun and a powerful workout,The punch track songs make a subscription worthwhile
177,Ryder,Feb 3 at 4:44 PM,5,Great game,I love this it's fun and gets you moving
178,Slickgator,Feb 1 at 9:08 PM,5,It def helps work up a sweat,It does help me warm up before I start my heavier workouts
179,Greg,Nov 18 at 1:43 AM,3,Far too expensive in Australia,"The fact that this is 27.60aud a month is just far too expensive. The free version is fine, but if this was reasonably priced-- i.e around 15 a month, I'm sure myself and many others would be tempted to pay. It's a great app. But at the moment the price is just far too high. Cheers."
180,T-money,Feb 2 at 12:35 AM,5,,Very good app for the price.
181,Tricia,Jan 18 at 5:04 AM,4,Refund,"How do I get a refund for this app? It was charged to my account after someone in my family downloaded it and I didn’t approve it.
Thank you for your help."
182,Liza,Feb 1 at 9:06 PM,5,,Love my boxing routine
183,Dan,Nov 8 at 12:16 AM,5,Fantastic for a quick workout,"Been using the game for my morning workouts for the past few weeks and so far am loving it, although only using the lite version (for now) so far it has enough to offer to keep you coming back. The drills and classes offer a good balance of fun and challenge to get you moving and feel like you are achieving something. The leaderboard and scoring system helps you want to try again to get a better score and improve. I would definitely recommend giving this a go."
184,Steffen Bratcher,Feb 5 at 7:47 AM,5,Good.,Good.
185,Crash,Feb 2 at 2:18 AM,5,Review,This is a great app
186,Kayj,Feb 1 at 9:03 PM,4,Fun!,I use this to help relieve stress after work and it’s so much fun.

189,Zakary,Dec 8 at 2:06 PM,5,Liteboxer,"It's it's lots of fun wears me out and I have RA, so I can't stay on it for about 10 minutes but it sure makes me feel better I love it!"
190,Justin,Nov 7 at 9:43 PM,2,"Good, but not enough to subscribe","If this offered some dlc’s rather than a subscription, it may be worth it. But $30pm is crazy for what you get.

The good:
- the sparring sessions are really good
- the AR implementation
- workouts do get you sweating!

The not so good:
- subscription model
- AR implementation locked behind paywall
- a lot of classes don’t even support AR…
- the full body workouts, ropes in particular, hardly work. It’s still fun and gets you moving, but needs some refinement
- quality of the videos are ok, but could be better (not a deal breaker). I already have 250Mbps fibre, so shouldn’t be an issue."

192,Capricornica,Feb 22 at 9:11 PM,5,More than I expected,Never expected to get a very decent workout even with the basic version. At some point I'll go for the premium but will explore the basic stuff for now. I like the fact that it's also not about just the punching aspect but they also have a full body workout and hoping to see a good additional mixture of that as I go through the features some more and see how I do in the long-run
193,JRock,Jan 2 at 4:41 AM,1,Why am I paying for a subscription ?!,At NO POINT DID I SUBSCRIBE FOR A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION BUT LOW AND BEHOLD SOMEHOW IVE BEEN CHARGED THE OAST 2 months!
194,Justnb,Dec 4 at 8:59 AM,1,One Time Verification Code EVERY TIME?,"Nope. Cool game but every time I get on, I have to do the code. That's okay sometimes but not when the game freezes up on you and you have to go back in. Fix it."
195,Obed,Jan 2 at 7:05 AM,1,Scam?,"I used the training once, then all i get is the subscription options. I want my money back"
196,ProfMatcha,Nov 5 at 8:19 PM,5,awesome immersive workout ( for free!),"I love these type of interactive fitness games, something I can pick up and play anywhere. Liteboxer with the Quest2 is perfect for getting a great interactive workout for free, anywhere at anytime! As someone who has never had any experience with boxing, their trainer classes and mitt drills really help me understand fundamentals and hone technique, honestly in my opinion is as good as hiring a trainer in person, BUT without the extra overhead of gym costs, travel to and from the gym. Plus there are dedicated levels mapped to popular music for a fun workout. Btw all of this is based on the free version of the product, Im sure the paid subscription offers even more great things, and I am considering upgrading, especially with the Black Friday 2022 sale!"
197,Kristel,Feb 23 at 9:19 PM,4,Fun work out,"I've tried the free version once. Boxing made me sweat a lot. My favorite was the rope. It was fun workout and easy to follow. The scores makes me motivated to get my punches hard. The trial version makes me want to subscribe. I just wish it's not a monthly subscription, pricier side. 
I am not sure if they add more exercises videos for free version. I will continue to use it."
198,FrEKEN A,Nov 4 at 8:44 PM,5,Fun,So I’m currently in physical therapy for shoulder surgery. This app is very similar to an exercise that I do tapping lights on a set of pads and it’s a real good workout. I love this app and use it almost everyday. I showed it to my physical therapist and even he recommended I continue to use it. Love it
199,Jaybee,Feb 22 at 9:29 PM,4,Love this game!,"I have to say that I didn't think that I'd enjoy this game, but I am. There is so much more to do than boxing. In addition to that, there are whole body workouts. The last workout I did had me sweating and my heart racing. You can also change the levels from your easy to advanced for some of the boxing sessions. This game does not make me bored because there are so many different things to do. 
 
I have to echo the other users who ask for a la carte instead of a subscription. I too will not buy the subscription, but if there are certain add-ons, I most certainly would. 

If you like burning calories while having fun, this game is for you!"
200,Balloon Doggo,Nov 4 at 2:52 AM,5,Workout positive,"I was a little iffy at first since I've never done workout vr, but once I started I really enjoyed it. The trainers are super encouraging and I really got into the zone the more sessions I did. The music also adds that cherry on top. I loved keeping up with the beats and actually felt good when I finished. Totally better than a lame old gym workout. Amazing game, 10/10 recommended!!"
201,Mandy,Nov 19 at 9:13 PM,3,Lefty's left out...,"Okay, so the game is fun and gets you to sweat, great. It seems all that Southpaw mode does is move the trainer screen from the right side to the left - which is helpful, but the actual workout is all still in Orthodox mode?"
202,schnipzel,Nov 2 at 8:48 PM,5,Very cool concept - well worked out!,"Very cool concept, which works really well. The first rounds have already made me sweat and it was a lot of fun. Varied songs and the possibility to work with ropes etc. in addition to boxes rounds off the whole thing. 
Does it replace the gym? No! But it's a great addition that allows you to work out from home or virtually anywhere in the world.

I would be happy if there are always new songs. For now it's time for the next round!"
203,Ross,Nov 1 at 9:01 PM,5,Great workout app,"I downloaded the free Liteboxer app on our Quest 2 last weekend and tried it out for about an hour or so, along with my teenage son, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it and felt it was a really good workout.
Will be using it for the next few weeks and may very well upgrade for the full version as the additional options looked great for a continued regular fitness programme.
highly recommended for all ages and abilities."
204,Golde,Nov 1 at 9:29 AM,5,Never thought it could be this fun!,I finally bit the bullet and decided to use my Oculus for what I bought it for months later and that was to help keep me motivated and stimulated while working out and out of all the apps I've tried this has been the best of them all. From the motivation of the coaches to the variety and music selection I'm so focused on learning the routines and making sure that I hit my targets that I completely forget that I'm working out until I start feeling the sweat running down my face. I actually look forward to the next day when it's time for me to do it again.
205,Miamiindahouse,Oct 30 at 8:09 PM,5,This is amazing...,"I am a keen fitness person, and use both the gym, and boxing classes. I recently decided to download the lite boxer app, and was really impressed. I did a 10 minute workout, and burnt 400 calories and had a peak heart rate of over 190 with my zone belt. 
The graphics and experience is really impressive, and very motivating. I am considering upgrading to a subscription. I am gutted though that the liteboxer go doesn't ship to the UK, because I would have 100% purchased it. 
Great app would definitely recommended."
206,Anita,Nov 3 at 7:23 PM,5,Bought the monthly membership,"I love this app to start off. It's easy to use, there's definitely some tweaks that could improve it but hopefully we'll see those in the future. But I get a good workout every time I use this app. The song choices just keep growing which is why I decided to upgrade. There's so much to do with the lite version though. Either way you won't regret getting this app!"
207,Marcus Bowyer,Nov 4 at 6:48 PM,5,What a Blast!!!,"I only have the free version so far, but I love it. I feel a massive difference in the muscle I am using compared to other great exercise games like Beat Saber and Synth Rider. This is going to be in my regular rotation of fitness apps and I will likely bump up to premium."
208,Karsten,Feb 22 at 6:17 PM,2,Looks like a not real ready game,i like to train with FitXR or Bodycombat and tryed Liteboxer. But this is not very nice Expirience. It seems that Game is not ready and they want money to do anything else like the Standard Training. I will stay with the others and deinstalled Liteboxer. You have to sign in to an Account and cannot delete it.
209,CJ,Nov 11 at 4:43 PM,5,Love it.,Quick workouts. Love that it can be done whenever you want and has a lot of features like a calorie counter for your workouts. A High score list if you're competitive and logs days participated and weekly activity.  It's great for me!
210,Nate,Oct 28 at 10:13 PM,5,Way more fun than it should be!,I saw the commercials and saw a one dimensional game and I was VERY WRONG. After trying a few of the basic workouts and sparring sessions I signed up for the premium and did a full body workout and couldn't stop playing and boxing along to some of my favourite songs! The song selection is very good compared to other fitness apps I've tried on here. I am very impressed and this makes it such a fun way to workout!
211,Five Cats,Jul 5 at 11:28 PM,5,A workable free version for casual users,"It's a simple app that trains you on one thing - controlled fast and hard punching.  So you have targets and someone encouraging you & keeping the rhythm.  If you were seriously into the topic and wanted to spend more time on it then the limited trainers and routines would be a limitation, but for someone who wants to try it or add boxing as a minor part to their routine then the free version is perfect."
212,XTCELITES,Oct 26 at 10:14 PM,5,,I keep seeing adverts about liteboxer and finally decided to try it. I must say.. best decision ever. Who knew being so active could be so much fun. There are plenty of activities even in the lite free version to keep u entertained and interested. This is a must download if u struggle with figuring out how to get into a workout routine..
213,Regi Bass,Oct 26 at 7:38 PM,5,Unbelievable!!!!!,"This app is so great! 🔥 I can't believe how much fun I have it doesn't feel like a work out honestly and I'm literally drenched in sweat after a couple of workouts plus it helps you and keeps track of what you are burning and all around the best fitness VR I have ever done.  the app being free makes it even better, although I do highly recommend buying the subscription plan the best purchase I have made on the oculus by far"
214,Jamie,Feb 27 at 9:18 PM,5,A Great Workout!,"I workout a bit every day but after using this app I really felt the burn.  Felt it in my abs, arms & legs.  It's a great full body workout that's also fun and easy to follow."
215,Steve,Feb 2 at 10:26 PM,5,A good workout,"I'm new to Liteboxer, and decided to give it a try to get some exercise, as I work from home and could stand to burn some calories (more than some, if we're being honest :) ).  So far, Liteboxer helps me accomplish that, as the workouts are not only good, but the ones with the coaches help keep you involved, which, for those of us who need help keeping motivated, is a GREAT thing.  I haven't tried the Premium subscription yet, so I can't speak much of how it works other than it opens more options, but there are more than enough options in the Basic section to keep me engaged for a while.  If you're looking to get some exercise in, give it a shot."
216,SonicNox,Feb 18 at 9:54 PM,2,Realy slow and not impressive,"Signing up in the app took a really long time because the buttons didn't work every time, so I tried 4 times and finally got into it with a lot of patience.  Then I could finally take a look and they started offering the monthly subscription for 1330 per month.  Yes, you read that right.  I just made a video of it because it all went so bad.
 Ok then tried the basic workouts, but compared to various other workout apps, this one is really not well put together.  And the trainer is flat and a not nice and clear video.  Free too, but I certainly wouldn't pay a monthly fee for this.
 Les Mills, fit XR and beat saber are really much better.
 If they start with the video of the instructor, it might become a bit more bearable.
 Also, everything is very short on you and feels very stuffy."
217,HACKERBOY,Aug 19 at 10:59 PM,5,Realistic,"I thought this would be a gimmick but it’s actually very very good. 

The videos that pop up to explain and the way the board registers each punch in real time is out of this world. 

Would be good to have more to choose from but it is good and does work as I was sore the next day after a 15 minute workout."
218,Queenie,Nov 7 at 10:48 AM,1,Battle ropes not working,Well to start  The full body workout is a workout but before you spin your money make sure all the parts work the battle ropes for me do not work at all they are stuck in the floor . I reached out to customer service for some assistance and they told me thank you for my feedback but  gave me no information to help me.
219,Ab,Nov 3 at 1:03 AM,5,Love this app!!!,"I told everyone I knew, with an oculus, to download Liteboxer. I played the basic version for about an hour the first time I tried it. It was fun, a great workout,and easy to follow. I plan to upgrade soon!!! Oh, and it's awesome playing controller free."
220,Maggami,Nov 7 at 6:10 PM,5,Free version is great,Even with just the free version there are enough videos to still get a great workout. I love it so far just wish the mini workout was a little longer but I just go back and do it multiple times. Try it out if you haven't already.
221,Amber,Oct 22 at 9:51 PM,5,Free version is great,I have been struggling with workouts so decided to try this and it has really helped. The free version still gives you lots of workouts with your own personal trainer. I can't go to the gym because of anxiety so this has been a great solution as i can work out and be trained by someone without being nervous.
222,Stargate,Oct 25 at 11:40 PM,5,LiteBoxer us awesome,This app delivers exactly what it states.  I am a 63 year old female and am using the basic version to try and improve my strength and balance.  The mitt exercises work perfectly for me.  I can easily see the potential for younger and healthier people to really enjoy these workouts
223,kamibyyourname5,Nov 1 at 1:16 AM,5,Really Enjoyable,"I downloaded this game to try something new and I enjoyed it. I like how there are many options to choose from even if you are trying out the ""Basic"" plan. If you get Premium, you will have endless of choices and you will really just have a lot of fun."
224,Nuruk,Nov 7 at 11:25 PM,2,"It needs work, a lot of work.","A review after 7 days of usage, and I'm apparently within 1% users: 

l'll get start to the positives: 
- Fun 
- Makes you sweat 

Let's get to negatives: 
-The application itself needs work; some punches do not register which results in a combo break. 
-The website offers you one month free, however that one month wasn't linked to my account and I can't remove my billing details which I think is abysmal. Considering you're not abided by a contract. (I have contacted the customer support for those details to be removed)- Issue Resvoled: Thank you Lilly from the customer support service team for resolving this issue. Just as a footnote, don't get confused with a membership on their website and the membership from the Oculus store as they're two seperate things.
-For the classes where the screen is to the right of you, the screen should be placed behind the ""liteboxer hit box"". As when the trainer explains your hit combo, those also account into your score on which you can miss out.  
-The ""statistic"" on home page should be further explorable, where you can go back to a chosen day and compare how you did with your other day. The punch count is a great additional however, at the end of each work out you will see some brief statistic such as ""3.4ms"", for a beginner this could be confusing, therefore you should really explain what 3.4ms means. 

-Some classes don't even tell you to stretch before the exercise to avoid injury. The developers of this application need to realize that some people just get into this “game” head first without prior boxing experience.  

Features I’d love to see: 
-Live scheduled “jump in, jump out” classes  
-Full body tracking or leg tracking with motion capture. 

Aside from my critical review, I have high hopes for this game. 
Just please sort out your payment page...."
225,Brady Patrick,Oct 21 at 9:42 PM,5,Liteboxer,"Being an ex boxer I was quite skeptical about this,  but I was very pleasantly surprised. 
The programs weren't overly complicated,  the trainers explained body positioning and alignment (which I thought very important for those who don't know how to stand!), and even though the programs were quite short,  that just meant you could try others out re- do ones to try and beat your previous score. 
I must say- this was fun!"
226,Doubletrouble,Oct 21 at 5:17 PM,5,Free is awesome,"The free version is awesome, it was perfect for me on those intense workout days to start with Liteboxer as a warm up before hitting it hard, but it was just as good on my off days to hop on their for a active off day.  I just have to do one or two of the two songs mitt section.  It’s also great for me because I am in Chicago in the winter time and I don’t have to brave the cold for a workout."
227,ElRamrod,Oct 20 at 9:42 PM,5,Great workout. New exciting content.,"At the beginning, I slammed Liteboxer for their product. Looks like they heard my concerns and made big changes.
The new changes from sparring to full-body kept me occupied and gave me an excellent workout. 
As a professional who travels often, I can now bring my Oculus Quest 1 to all my travels, and continue to have a consistent workout routine."
228,Rudy,Dec 29 at 6:21 AM,2,Cancel,How can I cancel the subscription?
229,UrMajestyDaQueen,Oct 19 at 10:00 PM,5,First time playing,My first time playing I was thrown off by the statt screen. However after I figured out you could indeed play for free. I got going. The trainers are clear on instructions and show you and you go. I like the fadt pace of the game. I wish there were more free songs but I guess it is the free version. Other than that mo real complaints. It's fun and easy to play. I like it and will be playing more.
230,SnipingYoMomz,Nov 3 at 5:02 AM,5,Beginners Bestfriend!,"Love this app so far, trying to master the basic levels before I advance to the premium. Great way to get a well deserved workout, if you are crunched for time or can not make it to the gym. Everything you need is all in one spot."
231,Tu Phung,Oct 19 at 9:46 PM,5,Super fun,"I just got this on my oculus, and it was amazing. I miss going to boxing classes, but I can’t go anymore since I live far from my favorite place. This is a great alternative. They have my favorite songs on it and the boxing was fun. I was sweating like crazy. This is definitely going to be my go to at home workout from now on. Everyone should try it, especially if you are in to boxing."
232,SweetieKY,Oct 30 at 8:25 PM,4,Great workout options!,"I like the idea of combining VR experience with workout to make it more fun! 
I usually play a couple songs on Beat Sabers to warm up my body and when I starting to feel the heat inside myself, I jump right into this. Feel great after 2 section of training and I recommend it to my partner to join the ring! He loves it as well. 

One thing I'd like to recommend is that the trainer video can consider moving to behind the target pads. It is kind of hard to look to the right to check the trainer's postures and try to keep up with the hitting rhythm. I want to do the proper training and maintain the high standard of scoring at the same time. 

*follow up review will be posted in a month or so"
233,Tyrone,Oct 25 at 9:55 PM,5,A Fun Way To Get In Shape,"I started this a week ago and have really been finding Liteboxer a really fun way to keep fit. 

Its really nice that the game tracks you progress on a calendar.

The basic version has alot but i will be going premium to get the full benefits. 

Would 100% recommend"
234,AweBeyCon,Oct 18 at 9:38 PM,5,A great game with a free option,"I knew I wanted a boxing style workout game. There were several options to choose from, but what puts Liteboxer over the top is its free version. All the others required a paid subscription, but this app allows you to jump in and try it with no strings attached. I honestly loved the guided workouts, but the punch tracks are where it's at for me. If I'm still this happy with it in a month, I'm getting the premium subscription."
235,Sonja,Oct 29 at 4:35 PM,5,Love the Workout Experience,"Definitely love the concept of working out at home, sweat included. Since i have a gym membership, don't see myself paying $18 for a subscription. Will enjoy the free trial while i have it. Reduce the price and you may have a customer for life"
236,TheThirdSaint,Oct 28 at 9:03 PM,5,Free Version,I'm currently only using the free version and it has been extremely helpful on my weight loss journey. I have no experience with boxing but this has been a very fun way to get in some good cardio without having to go to the gym. I highly recommend.
237,Tabatha Powell,Feb 25 at 9:24 PM,5,AWSOME,this game is great i gives me the best workout possible i can go on for hours if the charge was good enough on the device i would def recommend
238,Ramrod,Oct 31 at 12:21 AM,5,Great Alternative workout,"I’m just getting over major back surgery, so I’m limited in the exercises I can do.  This has helped me to get a great workout in a short period.  I started out slowly but I’ve been working up to more increased time and movements."
239,Smurkio,Feb 28 at 11:54 PM,5,Great Game/ Workout,This app is a great way to keep up with the calories you burn and also the weight loss. Great way to experience boxing as well
240,Gina Leslie,Oct 18 at 5:32 PM,5,FREAK'N AMAZING!!!!!,"I can't even explain to you how happy I am they came out with something like this! I was about to spend a fortune on a ""mirror"" machine.....This is better! No leaving the house and you have your own personal trainer! Now I had an update this morning and it's not letting me log on, i'll check when I get home from work today but couldn't do my workout cause it just kept buffering :-(  But for $180 a yr....that's cheaper then a personal trainer!!!   DO IT!!! WORTH EVERY penny!!!!

REVISED  10-18-22
    I'm ALL good to go!! Got home and did my work out!!! CHANGED my review to 5 STARS!!!!   DO IT PEOPLE!!!!  I worked twice as hard and woke up this morning with EVERYTHING hurting but I guess that means I'm doing something right!!!! Those leg work outs ain't NO JOKE!!!!!"
241,Superstardawn,Oct 18 at 4:27 AM,5,Great,I think its a great boxing game. Its really good to focus on yourself and you can go at your own pace. The motivation is awesome also that you get with a trainer right there coaching you through some of the levels. I really really enjoy this. Its great for people who wanna box seriously and be healthy doing it. Its a great game I havent had a issue yet with it.
242,NpHRhyu,Oct 28 at 8:01 PM,4,Nice workout free app,"I already tried it a couple of time to vary my workout.  As I am on a low budget, I am happy to find a quality app that offer a basic free plan.  I am not sure I will by a subscription for now.  But if the paid content is like advertised, someone who is ready to pay will probably find what he needs in this app.  The possibility to buy individual content could be a great feature for someone who can't afford subscription but who can buy some training sessions to expend basic plan."
243,Dark Pharaoh,Feb 28 at 10:21 PM,5,This is perfect,I wanted to by the actual physical lite boxer but thus is way better. I can take it anywhere and do it anytime. I love it
244,The.s,Oct 16 at 11:15 PM,5,Boxing my way to healthy,Liteboxer AR is a game changer.  I wanted something the provided basic workouts but fun and engaging as well.  That's exactly what I found with Liteboxer. A variety of workout options and customizations help to make this game truly user friendly.  Even a Short 15 min workout and my arms were feeling it! I would definitely recommend Liteboxer for those who want fun and engaging workouts!
245,Chris,Oct 31 at 1:43 AM,4,Real workout that gets your heart pumpin,A fun workout game with catchy music!  Just wish there were more well known songs.  It has a few variations in exercises.  Could use more environments and special effects.  I like having a trainer that motivates you as you play.  This game will help you get your heart rate up for sure.
246,Jennifer Block,Oct 21 at 10:32 PM,5,Effing Amazing!!!,"So, I will say that I was kinda iffy about this app before I downloaded it. Now that I've downloaded and been playing, I can't stop!! It's so much fun and has a wide array of music which is totally awesome!!! I definitely recommend getting this app! You WON'T regret it!"
247,The Norm,Oct 29 at 6:22 PM,5,Great game that adds an intense workout,I just got this over the weekend. Better than I expected. The hologram instructor is an awesome addition to this because it feels like their right there. And the targets are great and keep me focused on precision and timing. No doubt I'm happy with this.
248,Real ASP Sy,Oct 31 at 7:00 PM,3,"Great idea, but tracking is annoying AF","I love the concept of this. It's a great idea for promoting some cardio in an enjoyable format. But the tracking can be questionable at times. Fitness is about bettering yourself. So you instinctively hunt those new personal bests to see progress. When you're mid flow and it claims you missed a punch that you KNOW FOR A FACT you hit and costs you all combo bonus and destroys any chance of a new personal best it's annoying. When it happens repeatedly it's downright infuriating.

This game led to my first VR rate quit!"
249,Gabriel,Oct 26 at 9:23 PM,4,"Good Workout, will make you move","I downloaded this as a temp workout since I could not go to the gym for a few weeks. But I am definitely integrating it to my routine. On the first days my arems were sore (the good kind) It us fun and very we'll done. Enough variation to keep you pushing for more time, better scores and more exercise.
On the downside I would love a one price model rather than subscription. Also I obviously do not know how complicated a Calorie burner estimation would be but as a workout I would like to know. I was surprised that height and weight are not required to start."
250,Khloe,Feb 2 at 10:38 PM,4,Nice little workout,Recently started using this app and I love it. I use it on my rest days from the gym as its low impact on the body and a good active recovery. I would like to see more free stuff added on as the selection isn’t vast as I probably wouldn’t buy the subscription due to not using it everyday. Overall its a good app
251,Ryan,Oct 14 at 5:23 PM,5,Great workout for free,"Ive only used what comes with the free version but that has kept me coming back for 14 consecutive weeks as the in game stats page will inform me. 

Im someone who absolutely hates cadio workouts such as running and cycle machines but theres something about this that i just find enjoyable. 

Between the punch tracks, mitt drills and trainer classes i always find enough to switch between to keep each session fresh

If only the subscription was slightly cheaper I'd sign up in a heartbeat as there seems to be alot of bang for your buck"
252,Justin Brown,Oct 20 at 2:23 AM,5,A fun way to workout,"This is such a fun app to play when I want to change up my regular workouts during the week, and I still get a good sweat just like running mileage. The songs are so much fun and I cannot believe that there is a free unlike most other workout apps on the oculus quest 2 store"
253,Ryan S.,Nov 2 at 11:30 PM,5,What a nice workout!,"I have to say that this is one of my favorite boxing workouts, it is very good and keeps you entertained! The whole vr experience is pretty new to us but this is definitely a go to for us! I would highly recommend this game!"
254,Alex,Oct 25 at 11:27 PM,4,"Decent workout, very fun",I'm testing this out while doing the 7-day trial for membership. The workouts are a lot of fun and interactive. Every punch doesn't hit the way I want to but I'm learning the game and getting use to it. I wouldn't say that I'm winded and the way that I am from other games but definitely fun to say the least. In the end it depends on your fitness level. This would be a great beginner to intermediate workout experience.
255,Yammybro,Oct 19 at 7:33 AM,5,Update - loading,"It doesn't work anymore 🤷🏻‍♂️. It used to but after I updated it it just doesn't load


Updated review. It works now and I think it's great as long as you use it for an actual work out aka actually try lol not like my girl who just follows along n flicks her arms 🤣"
256,Landsharkdaddy,Aug 26 at 5:45 PM,5,Great workouts!,"I am 56 years old and wanted something to help me with working out or upping my physical activity. Bout a Quest 2 and Liteboxer was my first program to try and wow!

I really like the new workouts that show up every day. Not only are the challenging but there is some fun in there too. The trainer on screen is a nice bonus.

I recommend you get this program if you want to work out and be challenged!"
257,Bear1,Oct 30 at 11:20 PM,5,I enjoyed this game,I believe this game is possibly the best on the market for boxing simulators I have done martial arts (taekwondo) for 8 years and I wanted to try boxing this app let me use a free system to learn the ropes of boxing and how it works.
258,5ive,Oct 31 at 9:18 PM,5,This game is amazing,This game is great for working out ! Instead of going to the gym you could just play this game. My favorite is the sparring mode because it makes me feel like I’m actually in a gym working out and sparring.
259,DMaxx,Oct 25 at 3:00 AM,4,Looks like this app came along nicely,"I've been watching this exercise app from early days through others' reviews and streaming. Current version looks much more robust and fun. Like the color changes as you gain streaks of consistent hits. Like the addition of more variety of content. Fairly engaging once you get going. I'm basing the review on the free content and what I saw that looked to be good content for the subscription version. Keep the updates coming, devs. Definitely worth a look, in my opinion. Wish there was more to sample in the free version. There's a good amount, but would have liked to see one or two more items...and from the subscription area. Even if those were timed and would expire after a short time, it'd be enough to help me decide to subscribe or not. I'm certainly on the fence."
260,eve,Oct 24 at 9:30 PM,5,Nice workout,The free version is awesome if you need a nice little work out. I love the interface of the game and feel like I'm actually learning something. It's nice they have a virtual trainer to make it feel like you're actually at a class. Very good.
261,Corms,Oct 13 at 6:49 AM,5,Great Workout,"Have not purchased subscription as of yet, but after trying out the available free workouts, I quite enjoyed and will be purchasing the subscription in the near future to be able to take advantage off all the workout options.  I love the hand tracking as well, so much better playing with no controllers in hand, and the responsivness is excellent with the hand tracking.  so far I am 100% happy with trying out Liteboxer and will be using this in my weekly exercise, especially now that winter will soon be coming on the outside walking, etc will be happening less and less as it gets colder, so having an option to exercise in the home and have fun as well is a great alternative."
262,Ryan,Oct 31 at 3:23 AM,5,Lite Boxer,Great app for a quick workout.  It is close to a real boxing sparring session as opposed to just a game.  It challenges you to hit the target and keeping track of the speed of the punch and accuracy percentage.
263,GGGOAT,Nov 14 at 5:37 AM,5,Fun workouts,I like this app there are a variety of workouts for right now there’s enough songs to play especially that they drop a new song every day.
264,GirlMustTravel,Oct 24 at 10:08 PM,5,Love it,Use the app a couple of times now and was genuinely impressed with the workout and feeling like I had gotten a good work out in. I think this will motivate me to work out more-getting a good workout in without leaving the house is amazing
265,Josée federic,Oct 23 at 1:36 AM,5,Free version pretty good!,"Loved  it! Much more than just punchs. I've tried other games, this one is by far the best in it's categorie.
A little bit less expensive , I could probably pay à monthly fee. Could also be great being able To buy the game for a bunch or exercice."
266,Sherryloo,Oct 26 at 9:04 PM,5,LiteBoxer Newbie,"I was a total newbie to LiteBoxer and boxing in general before getting this app. It took me a couple of times to get used to the terms for the different moves, but I figured it out. It doesn't take long to work up a good sweat!"
267,Naiza,Oct 26 at 4:36 PM,4,Overall great workout,I really like the concept and the workout I get when playing this I feel like they should have more ranges of music or you able to choose your own. And sometimes moving the controller to fast messes up the game follow but over all its really fun and I would recommend giving it a try!
268,Jeff Morin,Oct 18 at 3:44 PM,5,Constant updates and REAL fitness,"This is the only fitness app that uses trainers DURING the workout.  They are super motivating, and the music selection is better than Supernatural.  The devs really listen to user suggestions too.  The freemium is good but the subscription is totally worth it too."
269,Brodie,Dec 7 at 12:51 AM,1,Bad,Nobody wants to pay because thrill of the fight is better and the free version sucks
270,Adrienne,Oct 17 at 3:54 AM,3,SimoneMD,I have only tried the free version still trying it out to see if I want to pay for this monthly. So fat it is ok I just have figured out how to do the other workouts. The boxing is a little to short for me. (Will update my review once I play a little longer. I'm new to the game)
271,Red,Oct 23 at 9:03 PM,5,Paid version worth it,I have the paid version and I think that it is really worth it. I have completed a few workouts so far and I feel it the next days. I know that this is going to help me tremendously with my weight loss goals. It is also so much fun.
272,SaintsAudi,Oct 10 at 2:01 AM,5,Free version good Subscription is costly,I will tell you that I'm trying to use my oculus for as many calorie burning exercise or workouts available. This lite boxer app is a great introduction to doing that and although I'm intrigued about the full version it is rather costly to test out. Lower the trial price and I'll update based on use.
273,SoupDog,Oct 9 at 4:37 PM,5,No better game when it comes to boxing!!,"I Downloaded this game because I wanted to see what it was like, I’d heard lots from friends and family so gave it ago and now I’m addicted! This game features many different workouts with different levels of intensity! No money is required to play but I think it’s worth spending some to get the upgrades!!!"
274,Rygl,Oct 26 at 9:30 PM,4,great workout wish there were more free,i just started using the program about a week ago.I work from home so 5-10 min workouts a few times a day are perfect for me. but with only 4 free classes its gotten a little boring would be nice to have a few more options before you are ready to commit to a subscription.
275,IgnasCrow,Oct 24 at 11:34 PM,5,Great introduction to vr workouts,I've just started the free version and I love it (might jump to premium in a week or two). As someone who wants to get back in shape I am really enjoying it and I am mixing different workouts and different difficulty levels.
276,TheLasVegan,Oct 15 at 12:09 PM,5,Works up a sweat,I've only been using it for a few days but really enjoying it. Still on the easy setting but can work up a sweat after a few songs. Looking forward to progressing to the harder settings and getting a bit fitter. Everything in the app seems to work well without any glitches.
277,JAMES,Oct 20 at 8:33 PM,4,Developer Read this!,"I like the app, however, I am conflicted.  I’ll cut to the chase.  First and most glaring issue is the lack of ability to lower / remove the punch impact sound effect.  The vibration is enough for me and to be honest the impact sound drowns out the music / trainers audio.  And most importantly the punching sound effect often times does not line up with the timing of the music which makes for a less enjoyable experience.  This type of thing would prevent me from becoming a subscriber. 

Other than that, quite nice. Stereoscopic 3D vid trainer recordings would be nice addition.  

Keep up the great work!"
278,Jackie K,Oct 18 at 9:31 PM,5,Best VR exercise,"This is definitely the best VR exercise experience I've had. It's been a while since I have exercised due to some joint issues and this is the best..doesn't leave me in pain and just feels good after I am done
 Break a good sweat and get heart rate up"
279,Hugo,Oct 8 at 9:09 PM,5,Nice workout for hard working adult,"Full-time single mom to two boys: one special needs, one typical. I work full-time as a CPA so I am busy. However, I came accords this app and it has been fun and  workout that makes me sweat even when only spend a few minutes. I love it. It is fun and a nice way to make me workout and I don't have to spend a whole day at the gym"
280,Kris,Oct 25 at 5:29 AM,5,Great app!,"I love the lite version and am considering the 7 day trial of the paid version. I enjoy the stress relief provided by the workouts. They are a challenging, yet fun way to get your heart pumping and relieve some stress."
281,Phillyphil,Oct 20 at 1:09 AM,4,New to it but enjoying the free version,"I just started the free version of the app yesterday and i truly enjoy the workout with the trainers and being able to box to music was enjoyable. I have never experienced a app yet like this so far.

I will probably use this everyday to get into  help me get into shape and I'm sure after while i will upgrade to the premium so that i can exercise to different types of music and different atmospheres and all the different trainings they have in store to use."
282,tobmsmary,Oct 21 at 3:10 AM,5,Love it!,I have tried this app several times before. I love the short workout. It gives me time to breath since I am trying to get myself back into shape. Now that there are free features I have more workouts to explore. Thank you for this app!!
283,Darth Vader,Oct 11 at 11:45 PM,5,Pretty good,"It's a pretty good workout VR game for when you can't afford the gym, it's fun, interactive and provides loads of workout options to choose. After a few 20-30 minutes I was already feeling the burn, if you want to lose weight while jamming to some music this is the game for you."
284,Markedcave,Dec 14 at 3:32 AM,1,,MGK update made me uninstall
285,Cryz'Tal,Oct 19 at 2:21 AM,4,different but fun,"wasn't really sure what to expect with the 'free' version but it has more than expected, as I have played 'free' games where there was only like one or two options to the game without paying for more but this has a LOT of free features and I haven't even looked at the paying options yet but it is easy to imagine they have a LOT more content! and it will all help with losing weight and getting into better shape than I am!"
286,Blacklight007,Oct 30 at 8:10 PM,5,Getting back in shape,This is an excellent way to start getting back into shape.  I set aside at least 30 mins to workout with Liteboxer but i will work my way up and increase my fitness goals as i go up.
287,Rare Necessity,Oct 7 at 8:02 AM,5,A cool boxing experience,"This is a fun boxing app. I love the fact that you have the option of not having to purchase a subscription and continue to use the basic verison of the app. However, if you want to amp up your workout then the subscription one would be a much better choice as it has some pretty cool premium features available."
288,Erick S,Oct 17 at 9:19 PM,4,Good workout. Needs beginner guide,"Overall I think the app provides a fairly good cardio workout. The trainers are clear to understand and the visuals and haptic feedback make it easier to follow along. 
I do wish there was an introductory course for beginners to get them ready before diving into classes though. Stuff like stance, move variations, and workout types should be covered. As a beginner I just kind of chose a class at random to start and had to learn from there. 
I went for the free option to try it out."
289,XX,Oct 18 at 4:56 AM,4,Punch out!!!,"Fair amount of free content, the subscription is more than worth it if you find your self using Liteboxer daily. The AR blends well enough allowing you to correct form and stance if you have access to a mirror. Wealth of fun songs to work out too. The training session are also nice to break things up!"
290,Blacklove,Oct 24 at 12:31 AM,5,Good,When I first seen this I thought to myself it's going to be just like every other game I have downloaded to try but to my surprise it jas far exceed my expectations. If you haven't tried it I say go download now
291,Toon army,Oct 31 at 9:32 PM,5,first timer,"i dont like going to the gym,but i do like to exercise at home.  I have a very active job,but being able to come home&do a bit of boxing is great,its fun&i really enjoy it"
292,Erin,Oct 19 at 10:27 PM,5,Great find,I tried out this game and was pleasantly surprised.  It has a variety of workouts just for the basic version.  I have not upgraded to premium because I am still going through the basic content.   I recommend this game to everyone.
293,Trisha,Oct 17 at 10:24 PM,5,Lite boxer,"I Just started trying this , the free version is good , it gives enough to get used to it , and try a few different things , I would consider trying the premium , but a little bit pricey ATM but would defiantly consider after a bit more use"
294,ZayZay,Oct 5 at 11:54 PM,5,Very Motivating!,"If you have trouble doing work outs or staying committed alone on your own doing workouts, then this will definitely help you with that. There are great workouts, and boxing lessons on here that are promised to leave you sweating after. Eventually reaching whatever goal you have when getting this app."
295,Daggeredheart,Oct 21 at 2:58 AM,5,Makes working out fun!,"I love to turn up my music and just forget about the day. Being a veteran, I never thought much of working out in a game, until now! It is so much fun to work out while I get lost in the music and concentrate on the beats!"
296,ricky,Oct 22 at 2:11 AM,2,didn't feel as engaging,i think the interaction with the punchpads needs to feel more engaging.  Right now when the punchpads is in front of me I only feel like making a small tap to trigger it.  It didn't get me a feeling that i need to punch it hard.  Hence it didn't feel as demanding and engaging as some of the other boxing type exercise VR games.
297,Victor N.,Oct 23 at 2:08 AM,5,LiteboxerVR takes Boxing to a new level!,"Liteboxer in VR is really cool. It is a really nice experience, alongside training and jamming with a good category of music. I would really recommend this experience to your friends and family.

Overall: 10/10"
298,Pocket,Nov 12 at 6:48 AM,5,Great,I play this game a lot and I lost a couple pounds and got stronger it a great game if you play it as a sport.
299,Dan,Oct 31 at 1:35 AM,5,Good Workout,I tried the free version to see if I would like it. Three minutes in and I was breaking a sweat. I am going to purchase a month subscription to access the other benefits of what it has to offer.
300,Emils,Oct 29 at 9:57 PM,5,overall experience,whilst using the basic version your limited to the newest songs and experiences but it still has great songs and good workouts available will be trying out the premium mode!
301,CJR,Nov 4 at 5:08 AM,2,Frustrating,"bought it and enjoy it but hardly using it -- EVERY SINGLE TIME I get on, it requires a ""one time only"" verification code which requires me to send to phone, take off VR headset to get message then reenter it just to play. Painful!"
302,RCBROWN7290,Oct 29 at 1:04 PM,4,LiteBoxer VR,I am new to this whole VR experience. The Liteboxer definitely gets a good sweat on for what i call myself as an old (63yo) newbie.  I eventually will check into it and see what other in game workouts there are in the near future.
303,Bizzii,Oct 30 at 8:13 PM,4,NICE!,I liked this better than I thought I would. Keeps you moving and the trainers help move you along too. I have the free version right now but I am definitely considering the subscription option to see what more I can get into.
304,Pete,Oct 25 at 1:24 AM,5,New lite user,So far so good.  As others had said the free/ lite version has some great features to keep you busy for a while.  I haven't tried premium yet but I have enjoyed my time on the lite version so far.
305,Alex Kirby,Oct 3 at 9:25 PM,5,Lite boxer,"I’ve some small experience of boxing having taken part in a couple of white collar event .I by  no means call my self a boxer .I’ve limited experience with VR. Having said that I-really like The Lite boxer app. You have six pads that you have to punch when they light up,sometimes an uppercut pad is added. The trainers will take you through different combinations  to songs or minute rounds . This is just on the basic levels. There’s so much more on the subscription levels that I’ve not started yet.The great thing about this is the home or on the go use .It’s the pp I’ve used to most since buying an oculus 2.I’ve already recommended it to friends .Believe me when I say Iwouldnt have if I didn’t love it ."
306,xspazyluckx,Oct 18 at 2:29 PM,5,Great alternative,"I was going to get a boxing bag. Instead I found this app
Holy crap I love it. Liteboxer really does the trick without taking up any space. I love oculus is general but this app is so responsive to your hits. I just love it."
307,Xerbrus,Oct 15 at 7:24 AM,4,Great app for exercise!!,"The exercise was very interactive. Kept me super motivated and focused. I was sweating soooo much afterwards! Its a great way to get your body moving, blood pumping, and to really just burn those calories. I love that they are short videos for people who don’t have enough time to do a full hour of exercise but still want to be able to work out at home. I highly recommend everyone to give this a try!"
308,shayg,Oct 3 at 6:59 AM,5,I love it,I got this game because I saw it on tiktok and I wanted to get in shape. I have a torn rotator cuff and it’s hard for me to lift weights. This is lite it doesn’t hurt my shoulder I can get my workout in while not hurting myself. I wanted to try the app before purchasing but now I’m about to purchase it. My mom that has cancer also love this. I recommend this for anyone that’s trying to get in shape.
309,Whitney,Oct 30 at 3:00 AM,5,Nice Workout App,I’ve had a Oculus for a long time and I finally found a really good use for it. I got a solid workout within 20 minutes and decided I needed to upgrade to premium.
310,Crystal Larkins,Oct 21 at 8:27 PM,5,Workout schmerout!,I've never been one to exercise and with this app i wake up evety morning and complete a 20 min workout it feels awsome and i look forward too it!  Been wanting to get into better shape this is the answer!
311,JJWillaert06,Oct 24 at 9:53 PM,5,Free Version. . . Amazing,"This was by far the best free version of any app on Oculus. I really enjoyed giving it a try and can't wait to buy it. I found it very accurate, fun and a total workout. Highly recommend"
312,Elhs316,Oct 25 at 9:06 PM,5,I love this app!!!,I love this app! I love how it has more than just boxing but a true full body workout.  I love that it has variations of time.  If you're struggling to stay consistent try this app!
313,Blake,Feb 12 at 9:58 PM,1,Frustrating sign up loop,"How am I supposed to sign up when they send a code to my email, I get out of the headset to get the email code and when I get back in the app they want to send another code? This is insane."
314,Jimmy Snaps,Oct 25 at 1:18 AM,5,Fun and invigorating!,"Just got this and it's a ton of fun! It turns working out into a game which keeps me motivated! I'm doing the free option right now, but as a get better I'm definitely going to upgrade"
315,G3t Wr3ck3d,Feb 26 at 4:36 AM,5,Fun,Love them keep me active fun and gets your heart rate going
316,Kelly,Oct 4 at 4:41 PM,5,Real Trainers! Not Avatars.,"While I am only using the free version, I really enjoy this app!  Having real trainers directing you is like being in an actual boxing gym.  I have another boxing app, but this has become my favorite.  Would love if you were able to buy it outright, rather than being a subscription."
317,Daniel,Nov 1 at 8:04 PM,5,Amazing workout!,I just started using the app and I'm blown away! Really cool workouts and very dinamic. I will get the premium for sure. It's totally worth it.
318,Kai,Nov 1 at 9:32 PM,4,Good workout for beginners,"I’ve only just started working out in VR, but the immersion of this app really makes you feel like you’re making contact with the targets. It also works up a good sweat in a short amount of time."
319,H31Ls8T2un,Oct 17 at 9:28 PM,5,5 star exercise app,The coaches are very easy to follow. The exercises are more than sufficient to get my heart beating and to feel the burn. I plan on recommending it to everyone I know that owns and frequently uses an oculus headset.
320,AV2007,Nov 4 at 12:26 PM,5,"High Energy, Motivating and fun!!",Great production. Very Immersive. I really enjoy the workouts. Trainers are phenomenal. Cant wait to try the premium version.
321,Robert Chapman,Oct 23 at 3:01 PM,5,Taking a workout to the next level,"Tried the free version, and was surprised that it was alot of fun. The free workouts are really good and make you sweat like mad. I will definitely be subscribing to the full version"
322,FuocoSerpente,Oct 13 at 3:31 AM,5,Brilliant!,"I only use the free version, and it's brilliant.
It's got Music beat mode with loads of tracks, Mitts training with different personal trainers, various other modes, scoreboards, fitness logs, estimated calorie burn, and so much more..."
323,Lilly1000,Nov 2 at 10:20 PM,5,GEMMA,"This app is brilliant, you can drop in and box when ever you have a spare 5 mins.  Fantastic for people that still work from home."
324,L2ewp911,Oct 17 at 9:15 PM,4,Good work out,I started playing with this and thought it was going to be simple. It's a pretty good workout. Yes you do need to have the subscription to get the best ones. But if you're looking for a VR to practice and work out with and to burn a few calories this is definitely it
325,Rhylnd,Oct 24 at 9:05 PM,5,Great workout!,Was surprised to see this app available on the Oculus. Have been doing the basic version (free) & getting a good workout. Will probably upgrade to premium in the near future.
326,Rafael,Oct 11 at 6:29 AM,4,Fun way to get you moving,"This app is very fun and it is motivating me to move after a long period of being sedentary. I'm not a fit person at all and got the Quest hoping it would motivate me to move more and this app is helping me with my goal. It is fun, simple and challenging enough to keep you busy for a while. I wish the free version had a few more features but so far it is good enough for me."
327,Klausomat,Oct 1 at 11:34 AM,5,i love the Liteboxer VR App,"it was a little bit difficult to install the app because its no more in the german store but changing to US, everything worked fine now. Because i am strictly against apps with abo only, i am very happy now, about the free limited Liteboxer version i can install and train with. Great App."
328,Nate256,Mar 2 at 9:52 PM,4,LitBoxer,Great app for exercising would recommend this to everybody with meta quest 2
329,Reddread,Oct 24 at 6:48 AM,5,Great cardio workouts!!,Learn a few fundamentals in boxing while listening to some of hottest tracks. Fun game with a lot cardio workouts that definitely makes you break a sweat. Highly recommended
330,Junaid,Oct 28 at 12:01 AM,5,Great,"not bad, even the free version had enough content to keep you busy for a while. paid version would be great for those who bought VR primarily to workout."
331,Emmie,Oct 26 at 4:42 AM,5,Liteboxer,I have been on the fence with getting into a monthly workout subscription.  Litebox has won me over!  The workouts are easy to follow & intense enough to fell it!
332,4EvaYoung,Oct 28 at 2:31 PM,5,Fun and effective!,I love this app because it allows me to have fun while working out!  I can workout with a trainer or by myself and there is music for every genre.
333,Dee,Oct 10 at 5:48 PM,1,Won't load,"My internet connection is pretty decent. Did all the updates, installed this game and... Nothing.  After 5 restarts.. 10 min sitting on the log boot up screen.  Registered and verified my account but nothing. What I did see at a point is that it's another subscription based game with limited free version... But like I said... It will not load so I gave up... Will try later before I delete it"
334,Nettie,Nov 5 at 5:29 AM,5,Premium,I have the premium package and I can honestly say I've been on 3 days and I'm more sore then hitting the gym
335,Ty,Oct 19 at 9:17 PM,5,Best Work Out APP Hands Down,The best  work out app and i have tried them all. I love it and now you can use full body and even if you dont  have a subscription you can still work out for free. you cant beat this app
336,BoomerUSMC,Oct 13 at 2:06 PM,5,First time VR workout,"This was easy (and free) to download, so far I have enjoyed the workouts and sparring.
I recommend this, can’t wait to spar with friends!

The only downside is having to get a verification code every time I log in"
337,Yusuf,Nov 9 at 11:04 PM,5,‌‌this game is the bes,So firs if you want to loose weight than this is the game you need to get thanks
338,TuscanLeather,Sep 26 at 6:01 PM,5,Liteboxer is Amazing,"I actually enjoy playing lite boxer! Having an extra monthly bill was not apart of the plan, but the fact that they give you a trial to test it out is what reeled me in. You can dance, you can box, and you can lose weight! Its fun and your working out at the same time. I can just say try it out for your self ! You will love it."
339,Melydawn125,Oct 18 at 4:42 AM,5,Fun!!!,The free version is fun for someone starting out. There are a lot of different workouts and different levels. I like that there are several options with trainers walking you through the workout.
340,Brian keehner,Oct 15 at 9:39 PM,5,super fun!,"I decided to give this a shot through the free account and am enjoying it so far. lots of different types of workouts, much more so with the full version. thinking it is worth the subscription price tag."
341,Coco,Nov 9 at 7:53 AM,5,It’s great,It’s really good for exercise it’s really easy and relaxing you should try it
342,Christopher Richardson,Sep 26 at 4:51 PM,5,Awesome workout,"I have never taken a boxing class, so I am very much a beginner, but I was looking for a great workout that I could do from home and still felt like I had someone to work out with and this app actually gave me just thought I was really happy taking the first small class that I signed up for premium. I definitely recommend it."
343,KK,Oct 13 at 4:26 AM,5,Fun workouts!,"As a casual user, I tried out the free contents myself and am absolutely hooked.  The music complements the exercises well and the instructions are clear for someone who has never boxed before.   Highly recommended."
344,xspirit-x,Sep 25 at 11:05 PM,5,Great Workout.,"Boxing light comes with a free 15 minute trainer led session. I was in cardio for 7 minutes of that, the rest fat burn. I’m not keen on just punching to songs but the trainer stuff is great. You see they have a passion for it, the cool down exercises are great as well. I’m really tempted on the subscriber version and will probably end up doing that soon."
345,Katy,Sep 25 at 9:51 PM,5,Love this app!,I’ve followed lite boxer on instagram for a while and have looked at the full device they have before but have limited space in our apartment. My boyfriend recently got an oculus over the weekend and I have found this to be my favorite app so far! While I like Beat saber the songs are limited and expensive and I like that this you can pay a subscription for changing songs instead of buy an expensive game package for a few titles from the same artist.
346,Sam,Nov 7 at 3:14 PM,5,Brilliant,Brilliant work out I have a use the free version so far and am enjoying it a lot.
347,KingofBrooklyn,Sep 24 at 9:36 PM,5,Exactly what I Needed,"The app is exactly what I needed for the purposes of getting a good boxing workout in when you want to do extra cardio, or simply just can't make it to the gym and want to stay active. The free version has good workouts for what it is. Could use a social media sharing option, but otherwise it is a very good app."
348,Mike,Sep 24 at 4:06 PM,5,Good workout!,"Great interaction with your coach as you punch thru your session, love the rhythm of the workouts, even in free mode it leaves your arms rubber.
My only complaint is the game is hard to close  if you want to close it and go the something else, need to just have leave or close button I haven’t found it yet."
349,Cjpp,Oct 9 at 3:26 PM,5,Amazing,"Though I’ve only had my quest for abot four days, as soon as I saw this app I was excited, and started working about with it, it made me sweat like never before and help me use ever muscle in my arm, 10/10, would recommend."
350,Carson,Nov 2 at 8:04 PM,5,Great workout!,I did 3 different modes and it was a great workout! I was really impressed and it was super fun as well!
351,Jack,Oct 22 at 9:29 PM,5,Great fitness game,"Great game, feels like you have a real personal trainer in the room with you.
You certainly work up a sweat with the workouts and there are lots to choose from"
352,Terri Lynn Crowe,Nov 4 at 5:20 PM,4,Free version is really nice,It's worth your time downloading the free version. It's a really good workout. I feel it the next day for sure! Great introduction to a boxing workout.
353,Sharon,Oct 5 at 9:14 PM,4,Not many options on the free version,"I love the newest update and how I was able to try the total body workouts.  That was awesome.  Would I purchase the paid version - probably if this one issue could be addressed.  Currently there is a liteboxer app available for your phone - awesome!  Downside, it does not connect to liteboxer VR version to sync stats (i.e., completed workouts, punches landed, etc.)  Other than that, liteboxer is one of the better workout apps available on VR."
354,Yarsk,Oct 5 at 10:16 PM,4,Good game but…,"Personally, I like the boxing elements as I felt like I got a workout out of that, but all I could think we’re doing the rope based “cardio”workout was wouldn’t it be great if there were actual ropes in front of me, then I would be getting a workout from this that being said, it’s a fairly small part of it and only appears once or twice in the basic free version but still ￼￼ ￼"
355,Bobby Tucker,Nov 3 at 6:49 AM,4,Amazing Workout,This app is legit! I love the mitt drills and that your coach actually tells you the significance of each punch thrown. Would love more content for basic user.
356,mumdukes,Oct 17 at 5:38 AM,5,LiteBoxer,This Lite boxer game is amazing and so cool. I love the total workout . I do wish that they had more options to use some of the features that are in the total workout such as the ropes .
357,MCherry3,Sep 23 at 10:17 PM,5,Great workout,"My wife and I really like this game/workout. It has Definitly helped with us not having a working gym in our complex right now, and it is something we can do at anytime without leaving the house to get a good workout in. My wife loves the song workouts. They have so many different songs to choose from in this game. We would 100% recommend this to others."
358,zay,Oct 8 at 9:21 PM,5,I love this.,This is an excellent way of toning up and having fun at the same time. Im not fitness freak but this works well for me as  you can choose the time of the workout that suits you. I really worked up a sweat and now im addicted.
359,NightAlpha,Oct 25 at 11:11 PM,5,This will be my new workout routine,The free version is so great to have and the interactive videos are easy to follow its a great app to have if you want to workout for free
360,LauraJanex,Feb 2 at 1:34 AM,5,Absolute killer workout,What can I say? An absolute killer work out. Absolutely love this game. Can’t wait to see how much more it can push me in training 🖤
361,DarkAngel8191,Oct 16 at 10:20 PM,5,Amazing work out,This is an amazing workout with great songs and an amazing training experience. The only thing I wish is that there were better songs for people who get the basic(free) subscription.
362,Tricey,Nov 1 at 8:16 PM,5,Great Exercise,"The fitness app is a great addition. Instead of buying a bunch of equipment, I have this all in one."
363,Chuck M,Sep 22 at 12:22 PM,5,Surprisingly Fun,I installed the free version just to check it out and with low expectations.  Turns out this is a very well put together program that is fun to run and is a great VR application.  My only critique is the monthly/yearly fee seems high else I would opt for that -- but the free version is still very good.
364,ladyministerdee,Oct 27 at 12:25 AM,5,Good cardio,This is a great app for good cardio workout.  I enjoy it because the trainer really sticks with me with every punch that I make.
365,Austin,Oct 2 at 11:55 PM,5,Love it,This app is awesome easy to navigate and im just starting to work out I can definitely feel the muscles burning the following day. Also I have a love for boxing and never could do it so this allows me to enjoy it and break a sweat while doing it.
366,Eva,Sep 22 at 5:14 AM,5,A great workout!,"I use this when I'm on breaks from work to try and stay active.  I absolutely love how great the cardio workout is and how good I feel when I use liteboxer!  

It took me a while to get the timing down, but I'm getting it!  I love the leaderboard and guided trainings.  

You get a lot with just the free version.  SERIOUSLY considering the subscription"
367,Bruce,Feb 3 at 10:47 PM,5,I like this app.,Good workout game.  Combinations are realistic and has plenty of options.  I actually like it better than supernatural.
368,Lianemaus,Sep 23 at 6:20 PM,5,really like it,"I am 55 and just wanted to have a small workout program. I was always interested in boxing and this app is great. It gives me a good workout, and even has programs where a trainer coaches you. You can choose from different programs, intensity and length. It is just what I was looking for."
369,Im2finee,Oct 2 at 9:56 PM,4,Could maybe add a little more to basic.,"Hello! I wanna start off by saying thank you for making the game, I love it but I think you should maybe add a little bit more to the basic subscription. I was thinking maybe add some more stuff to each category for basic, that way it’s more stuff to do. I would also say maybe add a cheaper subscription for the people who might not be able to afford the higher priced ones. Everything else is great, keep up the good work!"
370,Abbas,Nov 1 at 12:04 AM,5,Best Ever,Absolutely the best ever workout you could hope for. incredibly fun and testing. I lo e this app.
371,PootyFox,Nov 27 at 6:44 AM,3,Ok game,Only fun with premium not as fun as other games.
372,Dave,Sep 21 at 2:30 AM,5,So far it has been a lot of fun!,"I was searching for something new to tryout on my oculus and saw an add for LiteBoxer. I'm currently only playing the free mode, but so far it has been a lot of fun! It is good exercise and has been a fun challenge the few times i played it. I haven't explored everything yet, so I'm not sure if this exists yet, but it would be cool if they changed up the punching target so that it was different shapes(more ornless spots) and depths  (closer and farther)"
373,Mark,Sep 21 at 3:09 AM,5,Virtual Boxing,"I downloaded this app just to see what it is about, and I have to say it starts slow but after a few workouts it can get tiring. I’m not a very active person, but I have enjoyed doing these workouts before work and having fun doing so. I utilize the free version, and I am okay with what is offered. It’s a free app, has a free version, why not give it a try?"
374,Marcus,Oct 25 at 10:48 PM,5,,Great work out I really thought it was going to be easy but I thought wrong lol my body was sore like I went to a real gym .
375,Carl,Nov 1 at 12:09 PM,5,Love it,Can not believe how good this is even using the free version you get a proper work out.
376,Kai,Sep 20 at 8:25 AM,5,LOVE IT!!!,"I’m a real lazy person that doesnt get motivated running on the treadmill or exercising in general. However, i really enjoy the sessions and its exciting. It gets me up and going. I’m a few days in but have been working up a sweat after every session. I can’t wait to see results in a few more weeks."
377,PRG,Sep 19 at 9:46 PM,5,Body by Liteboxer,I use Liteboxer as my second half VR workout daily and I really enjoy the trainer lead sessions as well as the Punch Tracks which is reminiscent of rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution in some ways. As an almost 40 year old with a toddler running around I lost the time and energy to consider joining a gym. Liteboxer provides that calorie burn and fun factor at your pace without forcing you to pay for a subscription. The recent update has given me more motivation to keep playing daily! Work up a good sweat and get some modest gains while having fun with Liteboxer 🥊
378,SpicyJeff,Oct 26 at 10:22 PM,4,Fun and engaging way to get some cardio,"I tried this out as a way to get some cardio in as im currently injured and find it hard to do certain other things, I found it to be a really good way to get what i need."
379,Ossmaninthewild,Oct 29 at 9:07 PM,4,So far it’s good,I’ve only used the app a handful of times and so far it’s been good. I’ve gotten good workouts in although on the free version they are pretty short.
380,Craig Flanagan,Oct 7 at 3:14 PM,5,BoxFit fun,"Having recently purchased the Quest 2 I was looking for something to help keep me fit, sessions aren't too long which is great and soundtrack is great too. Highly recommend for a great way to keeping fit too"
381,Chauncey Mcneil,Sep 19 at 9:16 PM,5,Amazing App,"Although I prefer to use the actual Liteboxer, Liteboxer VR is a very immersive experience. I had such a blast doing a trainer class in Liteboxer VR, I think it helps you focus more given that it is a Virtual Reality experience. I highly recommend it for those who are interested in the product!!"
382,Wendy van D,Nov 1 at 11:34 PM,4,Getting back into the swing,This has helped me get back into both getting exercise and boxing. It is easy to use and has great visual. I really enjoy using this daily
383,LoShell,Sep 19 at 1:23 AM,5,AMAZED!,My expectations were low for a free version. I was absolutely AMAZED at the choices and the workouts available for a free version. I use this in addition to my workouts and it was just what I wanted! I would recommend for those that are not as mobil or for those just getting started on a workout plan! LET'S GET MOVING!!
384,Mar,Oct 31 at 4:56 AM,5,Fun experience excercising,Workout I really fun and exciting way to work out. Good music and definitely feel the burn
385,Ashton,Feb 1 at 10:09 PM,5,Good workout!,Been using this app as my workout for the past few days and it leaves a good burn and gets gets your heart pumping!
386,Becky,Oct 25 at 4:47 PM,5,Free version,There is alot of variety.  I wish it had a tutorial on how to do some of the moves. But all in all it is worth it.
387,Crumble,Oct 7 at 10:30 PM,5,SUCH A BLAST!,This is a case of not expecting the game to be as entertaining and fun as it was. I've always favored rhythm-based games; especially if it can make me feel this good when I play. I'm glad I chanced this;
388,Kayla,Oct 1 at 9:24 PM,5,Fun experience and a good workout!,"I was not sure what kind of experience I was going to get (not a big fan of boxing), but turns out I love this game.  I've now played multiple days in a row and it's given me a good sweat!  Can't believe working out is this much fun!"
389,pRiNcEzA,Oct 31 at 10:20 AM,5,amazing workout,great workout and with the free subscription im greatful for this app love it sooo much
390,Z3ROS3EPTIC,Oct 1 at 9:16 PM,5,Great workout,This app is a great workout for some people or if you want to learn how to box there are many trainers that give you workouts and tranniers for boxing if you want to learn about boxing or want to get better at fighting get this game
391,Ballergtzg,Feb 2 at 2:09 PM,4,Not bad at all,"I actually enjoy this and honestly I’ve paid for many workout apps and the virtual reality makes you feel more inside the gym, which for me is pretty motivating!"
392,Pedro Lopez,Oct 26 at 11:52 PM,5,amazing app,It is very engaging and the instructors are top notch as well. I’m considering to pay the subscription.
393,Dom,Oct 30 at 3:44 PM,5,Free version,Gets me up and active. Love it. Nice way to burn off a few calories and stay active.
394,BeerBellyGump,Sep 23 at 11:38 PM,5,So far so good,"Saw all the ads on FB and IG so have it a whirl. I'm only using the free version so far but liking it. 

The instructors are cool, music good and it gets my heart rate up. Might trial the premium version soon and see if it hooks me in. 

Definitely recommend trying it."
395,Ky,Oct 7 at 9:10 PM,5,One of the best movement games!,I’ve always seen the actual Liteboxer ads with the wall mount and never knew this existed. It is one of the funnest ways to exercise and it’s not just boring old workouts that I get burnt out on.
396,Jack,Oct 31 at 10:58 PM,5,Great game to work out with,"This game let me lose some pounds and   Is really fun, would totally recommend"
397,Parzival,Sep 24 at 1:30 AM,5,Amazing,I have not subscribed but use the free version now as part of my exercise routine. Love the tech behind the app along with the ever enthusiastic coaches. I would highly recommend. I would also love to have the real physical piece of equipment but it's very expensive.
398,Radstarr5,Oct 17 at 9:57 PM,5,Awesome,I play the lite version. And I enjoy it. You can get a sweat going within ten minutes. It teaches me coordination and rhythm which I lack. Very fun
399,RockClimberKen,Sep 16 at 9:46 PM,5,Surprised me how addicting this is!,"I have played other ‘exercise’ apps, but this one I really got into!  Not only does it feel like I am getting a workout, but I can tell my coordination and reaction time are improving.  What really set this apart from others is the along side video trainers to push you along.  You can’t help to elevate your session from their excitement.  Very addicting and I plan to play longer sessions as I get in better shape."
400,WickedDaddy,Oct 13 at 10:42 PM,5,Free version so far,So far have only played the free version and it is a great workout as is. Wife and I both love rhythm with the music and freestyle is fun too. Would highly recommend
401,Jon,Oct 27 at 6:00 AM,5,Great work out,"Really good work out, I could feel the burn while doing this work out, I'm really enjoying this app."
402,UndyingMonkey,Sep 16 at 4:42 PM,5,Good workout game,"The game has a lot more to offer than I first imagined before I started. The fact that you can play it for free is the most impressive part to me and if you want more content than you can buy the premium pack. This is a lot more useful for people who don’t want to pay for a workout game and it’s something Supernatural is severely lacking. It honestly an enjoyable experience and I’d highly recommend at least trying it, the base game is free after all."
403,mbmaccy,Sep 19 at 11:36 AM,5,Fabulous!!!!!,Thoroughly enjoyed using Liteboxer. Having been unwell for a while I'd lost some weight and muscle mass but playing Liteboxer just four days a week I've upped my fitness and am nearly back to normal. I do it at night and I get a much better night's sleep as a result. A definite must have.
404,Stephen,Oct 15 at 1:07 AM,5,Very good,Really enjoy this app gets the heart pumping good challenge I use the premium it seems abit much but alot of content and if you use it regularly it's worth it
405,Vicki,Sep 22 at 9:28 PM,5,Great access!,I love that you can access many features without having to pay. It lets me get in a small workout and really gets me going. I think it could definitely use some fixing on how close the punching bags are as they sometime are too close to each other but overall love it.
406,Bongobill,Sep 27 at 12:35 PM,4,very good boxercise experience,"i saw this advertised on Facebook, i have enjoyed working out in VR for a couple of years now (lost 3 stone), so, i thought I'd give it a try and I'm pleasantly surprised by the workout i got using Liteboxer. Plenty of workouts even for the free version, with some good music and guided exercises. I found trying to follow the trainer a bit tricky as they are off to one side and i wanted to make sure i was doing it properly, but by the time i watched and tried to focus back on the Liteboxer board, i had missed my shot and my streak. i would suggest that the trainer be visible behind the board like in the mitten training (excellent).

I'd highly recommend you try it, it's free, what have you got to lose? (except some weight)
i look forward to seeing what they change/add in future releases, utilising the full potential of the vr platform. 
i can see myself buying the full product and giving a full 5 stars

well done liteboxer"
407,Cal,Sep 28 at 12:35 AM,4,A remarkably slick approach to VR boxing,"This is a well designed and elegant VR boxing practice simulator. The coaches make it very engaging with a continual stream of encouragement and instruction. The music is great and I enjoyed the activities I participated in. The color, sound and images work really well to lead you through the strikes. Unfortunately, it's only a 7-day professional trial, so I wasn't able to fully evaluate the entire possibilities of the Premium options, but the free level is still quite varied and worth the download."
408,Faye,Oct 13 at 5:32 AM,4,Great App,This app has so many great workouts to choose from. It’s simple and has something for everyone from beginners to advanced. You’ll find yourself sweating by the end of the workout and you can’t ask for more than that!!!
409,DemonOfNight216,Oct 29 at 11:24 AM,5,Great quick workout,Look the free version is great for a quick 10 min workout if you are pressed for time!
410,Pine,Oct 1 at 1:32 AM,5,Great App!,I didn’t think this would be a workout app. But boy was I wrong! This is the best and most fun workout app I have ever used. Lite boxer is full of fun rhythm boxing exercises as well as instructional workouts! Just amazing!
411,Love Jesus Christ,Sep 15 at 12:48 PM,5,Hallelujah a neat program,"Thankful to God for the developers, trainers, etc and their work here. The content that is available on the free plan is nice. I like the idea of boxing as for growing in dexterity but do not like the idea of hurting people (even in a game) so it was nice to come across the app. I have been using it at least daily for over a week, and its usually the app i am looking forward to working out in. It is focused, and the parts work together to keep you motivated, with a nice learning curve, a nice workout where i want to keep improving. I could see paying for it in the future, its a little more expensive than i want to pay for right now; however, what seems right now like a nice package that is free helps me want to show some kind of monetary remuneration. I want to suggest a 6$ a month package that gave 25% additional to what the free package gives towards the full package? Wisdom from above, and  good integral health be to you in Jesus Christ's Holy name"
412,Psoas,Oct 5 at 1:16 AM,5,Must have for Quest users,"The best part is the real trainers on 1:1 ratio. Even free version is suffice for the starters, it does have good music which lets you on track punching and loosing weight. will highly recommend. 5 stars"
413,Drj,Nov 2 at 8:52 PM,5,Great way to start,Pretty easy if you know the moves but a good short workout
414,Bailey,Sep 26 at 9:20 PM,4,Great exercise,"I box often so I was a little skeptical at first. I found it fun and entertaining. I like that it keeps stats, and after a few 2 song mitt sessions I had a little sweat going. I wish there was a little realistic option for the “Sparring”, and a way to incorporate slips, rolls and other footwork, but for a free app it surpassed my expectations for fun and exercise difficulty."
415,Shauna Cavers,Oct 17 at 10:17 PM,5,Great work out,I love this app it's very immersive and the graphics are great I really like the coaching and I will be adding this to my workout routine
416,Courtney,Oct 28 at 9:05 PM,5,Amazing,Great workouts even just on basic I for sure will be upgrading to premium! Thanks!
417,Berdy57,Oct 21 at 9:05 PM,4,Gets your heart going,Spent 30 mins doing g 3 little routines. My shoulders felt it. Like all of these games you only get out of it what your willing to put in. Will definitely use again and again
418,Lise Morin,Oct 20 at 2:26 AM,5,Love it!!,"I've been focused on weight lifting and I'm now incorporating cardio, I just love this, highly considering the premium version"
419,Jp,Oct 4 at 10:21 PM,3,It’s pretty good,I’d say even just the free version comes with a good amount of content the only reason I haven’t bought the monthly subscription is because I’m using a gym as my main source of fitness but if you don’t want to go to the gym this might be a great way to get the burn at home.
420,Critty76,Oct 7 at 8:43 PM,5,Great workout,I started ysing the Liteboxer to get back into shspe. its a workout. even the free versions are super fun. great music and great eorkouts. im really enjoying it! 5 lbs in a week so far!
421,Corey,Sep 15 at 1:56 AM,5,LiteBoxer,"This app is great!! It's Guitar Hero meets boxing. Its super fun and addicting, but gives you a great workout in a brief amount of time. I love the ranking system, and how it tracks your velocity of punches. 

The premium version is in my opinion expensive but it does have new released songs you can use, and i do like the ability to search some hit songs. I wish there was some more new released music on the free version. Thats my only small complaint.

When it comes to the functionality and how great the app works. This is a great app. Glad they offered this for VR."
422,Prancer,Oct 7 at 7:43 PM,5,Good for your brain and your body,Great for keeping fit and helping with memory. A trainer encourages through the moves and keeps you on your toes. It definitely helped me   work out my arms and makes you concentrate .
423,Josh,Oct 2 at 8:18 PM,5,Honestly alot of fun.,I really enjoy this game since its a free boxing practise game. Multiple workouts to do and gets your blood pumping . It also teaches you the basics of boxing and is highly recommended if you have a quest.
424,jamieP,Sep 15 at 10:25 PM,5,Fantastic work out,"Great game if your new to boxing and want to learn the basics this is the game for you. 

If you are ready to freshen up on your old skills this is all so the game for you. 

I was drawn into it. Even skipping some real world boxing classes to take part in hours of fun on this amazing app"
425,Aj,Oct 28 at 9:11 PM,5,Free version,Great for learning and keeping you fit. Kids do boxing and love this game.
426,Alex,Oct 9 at 4:57 AM,5,Love the game,What more can you ask for out of a workout game. I love the mix up between sparring and total body workouts. Completed 500 punches with ease. I cut it on everyday. A must buy
427,Mershal,Oct 24 at 2:01 AM,4,Really enjoying it but…..,I only have the lite version but really enjoying it so far but I cannot purchase the subscription on my headset or on the mobile app.  Credit card is stored
428,Linzi,Sep 24 at 9:19 PM,4,Loving it early on,"So I've only been using it for a couple days, opting for the free 7 day trial after not knowing any of the songs offered for free. The library is pretty good, with a great mix from different genres. This is what will likely be the reason I continue my subscription. The classes are also fun, although not sure about longevity. Time will tell. So far however I've really enjoyed it."
429,Oreomilk2,Nov 2 at 4:37 AM,5,Good game,Its a good game it makes you use your quick reflexes
430,Frsted,Oct 28 at 9:27 PM,4,Fun exercise,"I have the free version and it's fun enough for a free version. Good exercise, but don't think you can go boxing everyone after."
431,Ashylychee,Sep 12 at 9:04 PM,5,Good work out,Where to start its music meets boxing meets work out its really good personaly i love it as having a medical condtion that affects my joins and body im limited to light works out and its hard to find equipment or rutines this is a game that offers light and good work out with the added adition of fun and music
432,Roshlyn,Sep 12 at 8:27 PM,5,Thank you!,"Can't get my PIN on my new oculus so stuck with free apps - and this is THE fitness app you want. It's the only free version of a GOOD app that delivers enough. The free version gives you full short workouts with professional trainers, great music, warmups and cooldowns. Compared to FitXR, this is better. I would compare it to SuperNatural, but they give nothing, not even a demo, for free. So when I can fix my device, this is the app I would spend money on."
433,HighVibeFreq,Sep 13 at 2:45 AM,5,Awesome Game! Pay Wall Is Unreasonable*,"This is an awesome game! Absolutely great! Definite 5 Stars! But I’m not good with the pay wall.

I saw Liteboxer on Instagram a couple weeks ago and wanted one. Then I saw that it was over $1000 and quickly changed my mind. Then I saw the creator post in the comment section that Liteboxer VR was coming, well here it is and it’s great!

I’d pay $30 for this, but $17.99 a month or whatever it was, no. I’m not trying to add no more bills, that’s more than Netflix. Not everybody is gonna be playing this everyday, but they will watch Netflix everyday and it costs less.

I’m good playing the trial for now, but the moment this is available to be purchased, BOOM! I’m getting it!

***REVIEW UPDATE***

Just found out I can’t play the trial anymore.

1 Star.

***REVIEW UPDATE 2***

Very happy with the updated free version! Thanks for listening guys. I would like to be able to preview a song before I play a round, but it’s cool! My 1 review has been changed to 5 Stars! Great game for hand/eye coordination! 

Here’s a tip, focus on the center while punching the lights✌️😁"
434,tea,Oct 20 at 2:12 AM,5,Game rating,I love  this this game.You get a really great workout and a nice sweat😊 I definitely recommend this game. 5 🌟
435,morphism,Oct 25 at 10:15 PM,4,"Good, fun, could use more variety music","It is fun, but as someone who sticks to one genre of music, it would be better with more variety of music. There could be a lot more variety."
436,Clayton Martin,Oct 4 at 5:07 AM,5,A New And Exiting Way To Work Out,"I really enjoyed playing this so far, I always thought it it would be cool to learn how to box and liteboxer is an easy way to do it! Its also a great way to work out your arms in a fun way!"
437,Massiveguns83,Sep 22 at 12:46 PM,5,Brilliant fun,I downloaded the free trial to get a feel for this app. I was hooked after my first go. The trainers and the playlists are first class. I could spend hours playing until my T-shirt is soaked with sweat. Highly recommend everyone to give it a go.
438,Taz,Sep 11 at 10:46 PM,5,Inspiring me to get fit again!,"Always looking for a fun / game oriented way to get fit and after a summer holiday resolution, this is absolutely perfect. 2 days in and reckon I need a day off, lots of stiff limbs, it’s definitely working. I can’t give it any less than 5/5 on a free basis but I wish that the premium version wasn’t structured around a monthly fee, it’s quite a commitment. I would far rather purchase extra tracks / workouts etc which I would gladly do on a buy it if you like it basis.
The only thing I think it needs (unless I haven’t found it), is a warm up routine. It has a cool down but having done this type of thing before, I think it’s too short. All that said, I still highly recommend it, great fun, suitable for all levels of fitness and will keep me coming back, -2.5 stone to go…."
439,Elss Buzz,Oct 31 at 11:09 AM,5,It is fun and hard work at the same time,"5 stars, as it actually feels like you doing a workout."
440,KnightMation,Oct 29 at 9:24 PM,4,Review,This game is pretty good even for the free demo of it! Got me moving pretty well and it was a fun test for reactions.
441,Cami Peña,Sep 26 at 2:09 AM,5,Love this game!,This game is fun and has an easy to maneuver! It has a great selection of modes and settings. I really like that it’s not too easy but not too difficult as well. It really helps me do a bit of working out while staying at home.
442,Koby,Oct 13 at 4:29 AM,5,Great workout,I'm using the basic version for now but definitely working up a good sweat. It's a good way to workout in my home and the time goes by quickly.
443,Zack Simpson,Sep 22 at 9:27 PM,4,REALLY great workout,"The pros: a lot of great content in the basic version and it is a blast to play. Seriously…you can get a world class 30 minute cardio workout that you will have a blast doing!
The con? The paid subscription is $18.99 per month and hard to justify. I would much rather pay $40 up front and then pay for additional DLC as it is released.
Overall you can’t go wrong here…give it a try!"
444,Riding,Sep 19 at 9:41 PM,5,A really well made exercise game,"I absolutely love this game, I've found myself working out daily and loving it, the addition of music being added constantly keeps it fresh, the only issue I've had is having to stream the lessons and without a stable internet connection it can be an issue"
445,Ryan,Oct 28 at 9:18 PM,5,Mr Bowie,Very easy to follow and a very good effective workout ☺️
446,T,Oct 30 at 10:28 PM,5,Good workout,Fun and entertaining with a good workout as well
447,ZBadWater,Sep 26 at 9:21 PM,3,Fun however too costly.,"the game is fun definitely. The cost however is impossible to find the reason to spend that much. 18.99 a month. or 180 a year is rediculas for a game. I would pay a one time fee of 20$ or just like beat saber, purchase each song. on thing is for sure I will not ever pay subscription for this game."
448,Mademoiselle X,Sep 21 at 9:21 PM,4,I like it.,"I actually thought you were going to punch people, but instead is a training board to get all your punches in and beating along with the music. It's fun, however I wish it was a little more engaging with the visuals. Stars popping out, strawberries, happy faces, or the like-- something to keep me more interested with some sort of goal other than making the correct punches. Or maybe something different swirling in the background every now and then. Yes, the suggestion is girly, and no, I'm not an athlete but I am an artist and VR is big for art immersion. It is more of a ""real"" training experience if that's what you prefer. I know that this is just the beginning of these type of programs and I am so excited now with what's offered and so excited to see where all of this leads! Anyway, for the free version this is another workout I've happily added to my queue."
449,Lailinda Mom,Sep 22 at 11:27 PM,4,Liteboxer,This was my first app I downloaded on the oculus. I recommend this app for everyone to download it.  I’ m a mom of 4 kids . I thought that I wouldn’t have fun using this app. It’s like a work out. And it’s like your learning how to box.  You break a sweat. I was tired the next day. But I use This app every day.
450,Chomart,Sep 26 at 10:32 PM,5,Simple & Effective & Fun,The first 24 hours after downloading I played for hours. The list of songs on the free version are fun and keep it interesting. If you are looking for a fun simple boxing game this is it. I would definitely recommend.
451,Dior,Nov 4 at 1:37 PM,5,Great work out,You will be sweating
452,Sportychik45,Oct 24 at 11:24 PM,5,Great app,I got the free version and I love it I look forward to working out daily.
453,Nati,Sep 23 at 10:24 PM,5,Just What I Need!!,I had been looking for a good boxing app to try while and this is the PERFECT fit. The free version has allowed me to do the right amount of fitness and consider getting the paid version when I'm looking for a greater challenge.
454,Dan,Nov 2 at 8:59 PM,4,Good game!,"It's a really nice game, It's more that just a game and I'm very happy to found this."
455,rektophobia,Sep 21 at 2:28 AM,4,For the price it's a good app,"I wish there were more dimensions to punching rather than just punching a straight wall. Some combos and punches are more effective on different planes such as uppercuts and hooks which I can't really practice. That being said, the amount of workouts in a free program like this is impressive and I always break a sweat when doing them. Maybe there is more of what I am talking about in the premium version but I'm not planning on paying for that at the moment."
456,Jasmine Drake,Oct 17 at 9:31 PM,5,Better than expected,This game is much better than I expected. It helps relieve stress and frustration from your daily routine.
457,Zanmato,Aug 9 at 9:37 PM,5,Great for casual pickup and play!,"Liteboxer i've found to be a great game with absoltely tons of content. It edges you into the game slowly almost to the point where you'll think it's easy and then it'll really start getting your heart rate going to an extensive playlist of fantastic songs. It really doesn't feel like a workout though as you'll be having to much fun.

Yes, you have the option to pay a monthly fee for premium but this is additional to the base game that you get free that still has plenty of content. 

All in all a fantastic free workout fitness game that i'm absolutely loving."
458,Jordan,Sep 8 at 10:27 PM,5,Love the app - some improvements,"I'm a premium paid user and while the price is a bit steep, I do find the service worth it provided that the tracks and workouts are consistently updated.

Recommendations for improvement:

Having a song preview section - I'm mostly into rock and older songs and I'm not familiar with a lot of the music on there. It would be great to hover over a song and hear a preview of what it sounds like, similar to beat saber

I also think having some more gamified workouts would be a great idea, for example why not have something similar to beat saber or les mills? Maybe have a workout game similar to thrill of the fight where you face an actual opponent"
459,Tiffany,Sep 27 at 11:19 PM,5,Love LOVE LOOOOOVE THIS GAME!!,this game is easy to play easy to figure out and offers a great workout while having fun. it’s something the whole family can enjoy and challenges all of our different skill levels!! worth every penny!!!
460,Kamyrn Perry,Oct 24 at 9:44 PM,5,First time,These games are actually soothing feels like your in a whole new world
461,Col.Attwan,Oct 18 at 11:42 PM,4,Awesome!,First time trying it and I loved it! I did 10 minutes or so with a few songs and trials and I was sweating. Great cardio work out! Would recommend to others!
462,Foghorn,Oct 25 at 10:08 PM,5,Boxer review,My son loves this and I'm now taking him to real boxing classes.
463,Zip,Oct 30 at 9:23 PM,4,Get sweaty in minutes,"I tried the 1, 10 and 15 minute workouts. All diff trainers and all diff workouts to get sweaty."
464,Sebas,Sep 22 at 8:53 AM,5,"Great, almost perfect","The app itself it's great, the control are smooth and is easy-going, the only thing its that the paid services do not offer that much content, and the free service offers too little... its a good app if you want to exercise a bit."
465,Taylor,Sep 15 at 6:26 PM,5,Really good boxing app,Quite a fun workout and although the premium is abit overpriced in my opinion it offers some good music that makes it better overall. Would be nice to see an AR pass through feature like I've seen in other boxing games so you don't punch anything in your room.
466,Amouloz,Sep 29 at 9:27 PM,5,Got me motivated,"I struggle to get off my butt to work out but this got me so pump, easy way to burn calories and have fun at the same time, I personally like the trainer in front of me instead of the side."
467,Jeggo,Oct 14 at 3:51 AM,5,Brilliant,Honestly I have not done a great deal on it yet but what I have I have enjoyed a lot and for free too highly recommend
468,Victor,Sep 19 at 2:27 AM,4,Sweat Inducing and Surprisingly Fun.,"I've been playing Liteboxer for a couple of weeks now and it is really interesting in the approach. Without the physical shield to hit, the only thing you can really train is your cardio, hand speed, and reaction time. You really won't get ""stronger"" per se, but you should be able to improve your endurance. The freemium version has quite a bit of content and the classes get updated so you aren't just playing the same thing over and over. On the paid subscription version , there is a whole lot more songs, classes, and workouts. The best thing about the freemium version is that you can basically sample all the workout types that the the paid version has. No specific workout type is locked so you get a full taste of what the app offers in terms of training.

This game does get me pretty sweaty, but really just my face. The combination of a VR headset that heats up and no real ventilation makes my head drip after 15 minutes. Just remember, sweat is a function of body heat not workout intensity. The amount of moisture you produce will vary person to person. 

""As for gameplay"", it's kind of like Dance Dance Revolution for your hands. Timing and pattern recognition is the name of the game. 

The only thing I wish they would find a way to adjust are the trainer led workouts. The trainers are shown off to the left of the hit boxes and if you are watching the trainer you will miss the input for the hit boxes. If they can find a way to keep your focus on the hit box or not have inputs when the trainer is talking, that would make this a 5 star app. Right now it is a 4, even a 4+."
469,Zeuz644,Oct 19 at 2:27 AM,5,Pretty good exercise,"Honestly the free version is pretty good, nice beats, good workouts, all around pretty cool."
470,Speedoverflow,Oct 31 at 8:22 PM,5,Very nice,Very nice game for training
471,Levi Massie,Nov 13 at 7:44 AM,1,Why,"I can’t 
buy the subscription"
472,Blake luckman,Sep 9 at 9:54 PM,5,Amazing workouts !,An amazing game with amazing workout that really breaks a sweat within five minutes Great coaches and awesome padwork and sparing sessions and an amazing song that just really pumped up the vibe and gets you through your work out an amazing game I absolutely recommend it to anyone! ￼
473,Oskie,Sep 26 at 7:26 AM,5,Liteboxing great workout app,"Man I’ll tell you what !! This app made me feel like I’m out of shape… sure gave me a great workout., 15 minutes a day makes me feel like 1 million Dalits a day great job liteboxing …. Must use app"
474,Marisha,Sep 26 at 9:59 PM,5,Love it!,I really enjoyed my time while using liteboxer.  It's very simple to use and does ensure that you will have a good workout each and every time that you use it. I enjoyed the selection of music as well
475,JuciBooty,Oct 24 at 9:13 PM,5,Free version is great,This is a great app! Really helped me get into working out!
476,MPN52,Oct 30 at 8:45 PM,4,Free version,"As a casual user, the free option was right for me.  It will give you a basic workout."
477,Hellsing,Jul 6 at 10:49 PM,5,Great investment in yourself,"Didn’t really I understand working out in VR at first until I downloaded this app and it had me sweating and swore from the work outs. Most work out with instructors start with a light warm up and then slowly starts to pick up the intensity and then goes for a cool down stretch towards the end. Just a 10 min quick work will have you feeling so much awesome about yourself, I even have added this quick sessions to my whole work out using some of the programs as a quick warm up. This is truly an investment in yourself and well-being your future self will thank you for this."
478,Joey,Sep 17 at 4:45 PM,4,Using Liteboxer daily,"I've added the free version (basic) daily to my workout routine.  It's a good warm up of my shoulders and core.  I do make sure I move around while using the game (bob/weave my head and getting low on low punches, rotating hips and legs for stronger punches).  You will only get out what you put in.  I will not be purchasing the premium version but could definitely see it being worth the money to those who do upgrade.  I haven't seen where hook punches and uppercuts are used, only straight punches, so that would make it more realistic."
479,SirRatto,Sep 20 at 7:41 PM,5,"Very cool, worth the download","Great game/app for boxing fitness. Easy to use and found it a fantastic work out. 
The free option is great but I Wish they would do a different subscription package as I think I’d buy it if it was a little cheaper per month."
480,Rust,Oct 26 at 12:39 AM,5,Good,"It's great, gives me something to do in my free time"
481,Scott,Sep 21 at 4:42 PM,5,Free version is perfect for beginners,"Having a free version of this app is perfect for Beginners like me, it gives a good, simple workout to start to build stamina and routine. The simplicity and easy-to-follow steps of this app are fantastic! Would recommend"
482,Erin,Sep 14 at 9:04 PM,5,Awesome!,I have tried several different boxing apps on Oculus. I find this app to be very rewarding. Having actual people versus avatars is a nice change and I like that there is music I enjoy on it. I even see familiar faces from other apps on this. Great workout!
483,Jaiden Cooke,Sep 27 at 1:45 AM,5,Awesome game,I absolutely love this game!! It is fun as well as a good workout. I like how you have a trainer as well showing you exactly what to do next. I think anyone from young to old will enjoy this game!
484,Katamus,Sep 21 at 9:44 PM,5,Try the trial and see what you think,"Using the trial, the stuff that is one there is pretty good. Good fitness app. Pretty good rhythm game, just wish the sparring session sequences can be done without the instructor cause that's where the harder stuff is."
485,Thunderboltz,Oct 14 at 2:15 AM,5,Awesome workout,57 years now and in my youth I was a amateur boxer.. This app is awesome. If only this was around back then..
486,Jjasay,Oct 25 at 7:09 AM,4,Great workout,My wife and i just started playing and love the workouts especially the total body. I would recommend this app.
487,amanda lynn beck,Sep 17 at 10:34 PM,5,I love this game!,"It's really hard to know where the mitts are going to light up next, but I got so good at it I only missed like 4 in 100! What a workout... I must've met my 700 punch goal for a week the first day- WHAT A WORKOUT! 
I was sweating so much."
488,Matthew,Oct 19 at 4:26 PM,5,Great Game,"Very good free game for boxing and exercise, thinking of upgrading to premium"
489,Charlie,Sep 19 at 9:55 PM,4,"Surprised me, I liked it!",A friend told me about Lite Boxer and I was hesitant to try it as I'm not a big boxing fan.  I was surprised that I really enjoyed it!  I was wore out after 4 sessions my first time.  I played it again the next day and really listened to the instructor.  It really is a great workout!
490,Charliepigeon01,Oct 15 at 5:18 PM,5,i like👍,"had a few goes of the free stuff, and enjoyed  will play more and update if i get a subscription"
491,Prof. Lewis,Sep 10 at 10:45 PM,5,Great Workout!,"I'm always looking for new and interesting ways to workout on the go. With the portability  of the Quest and the great workout options of this app, I can stay in shape no matter where I am, at home or on the road. Theworkouts ate challenging, but fun. I highly recommend!"
492,Suzz,Oct 4 at 2:30 PM,5,Love the music!,"Great workout, music gets you pumped up to punch. I have done other boxing workouts in VR and this is a little different and a great workout. 
Love it!"
493,Kimberly Scott,Sep 4 at 6:15 PM,5,So much fun.. very easy.,I have started my journey trying to get in shape and so because I'm a little heavier I wanted to start with something light until I lost some weight to actually do more stuff or stuff it has different levels of intensity that are really light. Even doing a 2 minute workout I sweat it is easy and it's fun yes you're working out but at the same time as virtual so you don't get the oh my God I have to work out feeling..
494,Ogechi,Sep 22 at 3:12 AM,5,I like it!,"It’s fun, realistic and affordable! It allows for accountability, and I definitely work up a good sweat in minutes! Love that the workouts change to promote motivation and minimize plateaus. Consistency yields RESULTS!"
495,Stuart,Sep 8 at 10:41 PM,5,Brilliant keep-fit app!,"This is a brilliant app. I’m currently using the free version but seriously considering subscribing monthly. 
Don’t get me wrong, the free version is very generous and has more than enough to keep you going for sometime. 
This is now my go to workout. Keep up the great work!"
496,Jon Magda or Milly,Oct 5 at 9:17 PM,3,Fun but not realistic,This is a fun game for people who want to workout and have fun doing it. I'm a pro fighter and it's just too unrealistic for me. If your a fighter you'll understand when playing but regardless still a fun little game to play.
497,Tina,Oct 9 at 2:53 AM,5,I love this,It’s been thought trying to find time for scheduled classes so this makes my heart sing. And doesn’t hurt my wrists love it!
498,Nihal,Nov 1 at 3:36 PM,5,Fun,Very fun
499,RedsFan,Sep 19 at 10:12 PM,5,Best Workout App,This is by far the best workout I have found on the Oculus. I like that I can switch between workout times and have the music to go with my workout. Its amazing have a trainer right there to keep me motivated and hyped up.
500,Samuel,Oct 31 at 8:23 PM,5,Good,It’s good
501,Hope,Oct 25 at 9:20 PM,4,Great workout,"I hate to work but since I have downloaded this app, I have went from 0 to 1 day a week to 4 days."
502,Ruth,Sep 3 at 12:23 PM,5,Good free version,"Got the free version as I want to try and get fit, and although you don't get loads of workouts etc I think there is just enough variety to keep me entertained. I like the trainer led workouts as it doesn't feel like I'm on my own and they give some good tips. If you like lots of variety you'd need to upgrade and pay."
503,Stephanie,Oct 18 at 12:46 AM,5,What a workout!,This game is so good has my arms on for my legs on fire it’s an amazing game
504,Bambi,Oct 16 at 5:01 PM,5,Good way to work out,Really enjoy this app. good way to get a sweat on. Gw motivates me to go plus ultra
505,riteshtiwari,Oct 6 at 6:26 PM,5,Great workout,Fun and quick way to get cardio done. I do 4-5 songs (sessions are divided into songs) which satisfies my weekly cardio requirements.
506,Codyisin,Sep 15 at 12:47 AM,4,Its great but,The game is great a lot of fun and the music choices are diverse. But the pay model the developer has chosen to use is not my cup of tea. I am not a fan of a monthly subscription model on anything because they are always ridiculously priced and having just a couple subscriptions add up to a lot of money. My preference would be a larger initial investment that I own the basic product and then have to pay additional for expansions like Beat Saber does.
507,Allen -n- Michaela,Sep 16 at 12:34 AM,5,Amazing,I saw the stand version of this and loved it but not the price. This app version is amazing and easy to work. I love that it tells how many calories burned during the workout so there’s no guess work. The song selection is also amazing
508,Joy H Mayse,Oct 11 at 1:07 AM,5,,Very intuitive and it truly trains you correctly. And is a great way to get your cardio going and burn calories.
509,Phil,Oct 24 at 8:32 PM,5,Absolutely love it,Amazing game for a quick and easy workout.
510,nat,Oct 24 at 9:02 PM,4,Honestly great,The free version is absolutely great and worth the try. The premium version is also pretty amazing
511,Scoot,Oct 15 at 12:48 AM,5,Free version is enough,It’s a great workout. I do 2 of the free 16min workouts with GW and get a good sweat in.
512,Ant,Sep 20 at 10:35 PM,4,Awesome app,Brilliant I really like the workouts as an ex kickboxer brought it all back    gets  you sweating in no time . Boxing pad work  is good with different combos  in each lesson  the only bad thing is . Offered a 12month  or monthly pass was a bit pricey which is a shame
513,Raegan,Oct 3 at 1:53 AM,5,must have for getting into boxing,great for a workout and has a simple and straight forward layout like this and will continue to use it just like many others should. Highly recomend.
514,NanaX3,Oct 19 at 10:45 PM,5,Loving it!,I like the variation in workouts and the coaches encouragements.
515,DJFUNTIME RR,Oct 16 at 11:49 AM,5,Great,This is a great game very good for fitness with a fun musical twist would recommend
516,Aaron,Oct 28 at 10:08 PM,5,Good,Very good exercise
517,Alfie,Oct 27 at 9:02 PM,4,Very fun,It's quite fun if I'm being honest it's like beatsaber on a way but boxing hahha
518,Hobokengal,Oct 11 at 9:48 PM,4,Great app!,i loved it! struggled a bit to start. there wasnt alot of explanation on how to play/use the app. once u start u get the hang of it. i am considering upgrading.
519,Lianna,Oct 23 at 8:09 PM,3,I want to like it but...,really fun premise but needs more work.  tracking isn't great.  app will be a whole lot more enjoyable when that's resolved
520,Carlos,Nov 3 at 3:07 PM,3,Stuck,The ropes spawn into the floor and I can do that part of the workout
521,A grenade,Oct 12 at 9:08 PM,4,Not bad,"The music is better then i expected, no technique instructions but if you just want to have some fun hitting at targets then you may find this enjoyable."
522,Jameelah Muhammad,Sep 11 at 2:06 AM,5,Really Rocks!!!!,"Liteboxer is the Bomb!!! This game is awesome, I just started using this one, and its now my favorite..

The trainers are there with you each step of the way.. Its not just a game  its fitness and fun!!! I never knew I could box, until now.. I love it!!!!"
523,Kathleen Smith,Sep 1 at 2:18 PM,5,"New to Oculus,great starter fitness game","I bought an Oculus recently for me and my 3 children. Personally, I purchased it in mind for fun for the kids and fitness for me. I downloaded Liteboxer as I know from previous experience that boxing is one of the best forms of cardio. I have not subscribed as I am still new. I tried the first small beat song (2 mins 55 seconds) and got a score putting me in the top 1100 on the scoreboard. Now, although I'm new again to the fitness scene I am extremely competitive so I tried again for a higher score. I got in the top 950. I then tried a longer workout. I currently use the leather head attachment and had to keep pausing due to sweat and steaming up. My vision felt blurry. The next time I have a go on Liteboxer I will swap the headcover to the foam option.

I can see me subscribing in the future if the kids let me play on the oculus more regularly."
524,KaleahVR,Oct 7 at 10:03 PM,4,💪🏾🥳,I had tried lite boxer before and would’ve given it 3 stars. With this new update that quickly pushed it to 4. I would give this game 5 stars if there were more free workouts!
525,Stina,Oct 23 at 1:06 AM,5,Fun workout,This was a fun new way for me to get moving!
526,Brooklynn,Oct 3 at 12:15 AM,5,"Real boxing, real workout",Really enjoy using this app. I learn technique without feeling crazy because I'm home. I really can feel the aftermath. The music is good they 7
527,MetaWorldPeace,Oct 14 at 10:10 PM,4,Good workout,My 13 year old daughter asked for a workout game so we downloaded this. She enjoyed it and felt like it was fun and also helped her exercise.
528,David,Oct 9 at 9:42 PM,5,Great game,Great game makes you alert and keeps your reflexes in top shape and keeps you fit . Plenty of workouts to do
529,91Sapphire,Sep 29 at 7:15 PM,5,Awesome Workout,This app is awesome! I worked up a sweat and had fun doing it. Great way to tone your arms. I highly recommend it for everyone. You will not be disappointed.
530,Adam the best,Oct 24 at 1:20 AM,4,"Super good, one minor issue",The whole thing is just so amazing but sometimes the exercises don’t load on the first click
531,Princess,Oct 2 at 12:15 AM,1,Not Impressed,"I was looking for a non subscription workout app. LiteBoxer tutorial seems rushed and the workouts are very confusing. Honestly Supernatural is worth the price because this app wasn’t good at all, free or not"
532,CoryL,Aug 31 at 10:31 PM,5,Amazing App,"Discovered this great exercise app upon getting my very first quest 2, needed something to use for working out, on the days i don't go to the gym. Saw they had a free account version to try, tried that for a few weeks. Loved it, and then decided to upgrade to a premium account as of yesterday. This has great music tracks to work out with. Fun challenges, and a great environment to be immersed inside. Overall, gotta say it's well worth the money i am now paying for it."
533,JJJ,Oct 25 at 9:26 PM,4,Lite boxing,Definitely a nice cardio workout. Wish it was more realistic without having to pay
534,Jesse James,Oct 3 at 4:02 PM,4,Decent free content,I use this almost everyday and I haven't paid a penny yet. All the free stuff is generally pretty good if you just need a quick little workout here and there.Get some punches in and off you go
535,DLich,Sep 7 at 11:18 PM,5,Great way to workout,I downloaded this app because I want to get healthier with the oculus. I was immediately enjoying the rhythms and picking up how to play relatively easily. Burning 25 calories in 3 minutes is a great speed workout too. Very impressed and recommend to any/everyone.
536,Gee,Oct 9 at 4:50 PM,1,Great potential,This app has such great potential. But ... Why so little workouts for paid subscription? Why do I have to do an email verification EVERY TIME I LOG IN??? THIS IS ABSURD
537,Ldunson,Oct 22 at 5:07 AM,5,I like it,It gets my body moving so I think it's good
538,DarkAngel,Sep 13 at 6:07 PM,5,Highly recommend,This game is great! I use the free version and I get a nice sweat out of just playing a few songs. Each song is about 2 to 3 minutes and you have the options to change the difficulty level. This game makes workout out much more fun.
539,Snoopy,Oct 23 at 9:15 PM,5,Mr daniel orwa,This is great fitness app 10/10
540,BigMPB,Sep 18 at 1:43 AM,5,Simple yet addictive,"I was a little skeptical about it at first, but when I tried it for the first time it was actually fun and healthy for me. I would recommend this to a friend if he/she wants to be physically fit to get in shape."
541,PhoenixRising,Sep 28 at 10:17 PM,4,Great app for beginners!,"Love love this app! I'm fairly new to this VR world, but it easy to catch on and this app helped me to move my body on a regular basis. After one of the 15 min workout, I'm feeling good about having moved my body."
542,MYSTICAL LLAMA,Oct 31 at 7:22 PM,4,MYSTICALLLAMA,Fun. Keeps you interested and looking forward to this workout!
543,TheBezt,Oct 23 at 6:35 PM,5,Great,Great game fun and energetic.
544,Pegg,Oct 1 at 10:49 PM,5,Liteboxer is fun!,"I “played” a couple boxing games, had a blast and was sore the next day! Perfect way to gain some strength and reaction time. Loved it!"
545,Spartecks,Oct 1 at 9:29 PM,5,LiteBoxer,It’s a really fun game and a good workout I’m glad there’s a basic no charge option to get what I want for a casual game or workout.
546,Bigtido,Oct 3 at 11:46 PM,5,Amazing experience,This game is  truly amazing. I love how emmersive it is. Not to mention it also gives you a good workout. I highly recommend it.
547,Kowbellski,Sep 10 at 11:18 PM,4,Great fun workout,"I use this on an Oculus Quest 2. The menu section is a bit jittery and I’m not a huge fan of how close it is. It wish it were a bit further away. It jumps around quite a bit as well. However, once you actually enter the game it’s perfectly smooth with no jumping. There are several different options for workouts. I currently have a free membership but I do like the game enough that I am considering upgrading to a premium.

The game basically uses a punching bag with 6 locations on it and you can box to music, with a trainer, spar or free box. My favorite is the box to music. You have to hit certain locations on the punching bag with the rhythm of the music and get graded on your velocity, timing and accuracy. You get a ranking for your score against other users top scores. If you know other people who play the game you can challenge them and compete against each other’s scores.

Sparring isn’t agains an actual opponent, it’s against the punching bag as well. To be fair I’ve only tried this once as it wasn’t my favorite.

Overall my favorite boxing game so far

Pros:
Fun
Boxing to music
Compete with friends

Cons:
Menu is glitchy
No actual opponent boxing"
548,Kristen Day,Feb 1 at 9:12 PM,4,Like the free version!,The free version is pretty good! Definitely felt like a good leg workout.
549,Stuart,Oct 14 at 11:30 AM,5,Amazing for Fitness,This app has improved a lot since I bought this. Great app for keeping fit!
550,Jeremiah5679,Oct 22 at 4:11 PM,5,I just reviewed it,Then I lost it so just 5 stars
551,Eric Jones,Oct 15 at 9:16 PM,5,Awesome,It is a serious workout that you will feel the next day. Love it.
552,Dudleys6,Oct 10 at 9:16 PM,5,Kids love it,Kids love this game. It’s so fun to watch them try something new. Easy to learn and fun.
553,Dori,Aug 30 at 9:58 PM,5,"Love this, so fun","Downloaded last night and played till my oculus battery died. It was so fun, took advantage of the premium free trial and there are so many punch tracks i think i might keep it. Definitely a lot of fun had no issues with it and love competing with my daughter to see who can get a higher score"
554,KaZ,Sep 13 at 9:48 PM,4,Free mode,"Nice to have a free mode to be able to try before hand.  Simple to use. Easy to do. Quick exercise. 
Wish they had a bit more instruction with form but as I only tried the free form they may have in the premium. Will give it a couple more tries before deciding to purchase or not."
555,Shirley,Sep 29 at 4:37 AM,5,This is a fun game and a great workout,"This is a fun game, it made working out a lot of fun. I did not want to stop. To me, the game was like playing rockstar in 3D. I had a great time."
556,Gio,Oct 29 at 5:59 AM,4,Very good game,It is a very nice and cool game to play and practice.
557,Javier Navar Jr,Oct 31 at 8:13 PM,4,Lite Boxer,Fun game! Must try if you like boxing!
558,Duckie,Aug 28 at 11:45 PM,5,"Sore, Sore, and Sore but soooo worth it.","While searching for a fun and rewarding but somewhat challenging, health and fitness game that's free and allows unlimited workouts, I ran across LB (liteboxer). I've never been a person who was fond of the traditional exercise and workouts. I would prefer to do something fun such as dancing while listening to music, etc. LB, along with other games, provides that for me. I don't mind the soreness and sweating, as long as it's something that I enjoy doing while getting in shape and being healthy.. Obviously I'm going to purchase the game to gain more access to the other workouts, but for now I'm going to FIRST see how well I do physically, with the free trainings, before purchasing. Looking forward to weight loss, fitness, and so much more. Referencing back to my chosen topic, I'm hoping that with consistency, the soreness pays off."
559,Ndarknight,Aug 28 at 9:19 PM,5,Great fitness app,"I’m new to quest 2 this year and have tried some of the demo fitness apps. The fact this app offers a free (limited) option is great and I’ve tried a couple of the workouts and felt like I’ve been to the gym so will be using each day before my next holiday to get in shape. Great that you have a video coach with mirroring what you do and very helpful as they talk you through posture, pose and delivery of punches."
560,mekatilili,Oct 14 at 10:18 PM,5,,I am addicted to this. Feels almost like punching an actual bag.
561,TheBeastlyJM,Nov 1 at 6:26 AM,4,Fun,Its a fun game and a great work out!
562,Diane Nelson,Oct 13 at 2:44 AM,4,I'll like it.,I like that it has a free option and you can get premium for a month if you don't know if you'll be during consistently for a year.
563,Void,Oct 23 at 9:02 PM,5,good,its just that good
564,Re,Sep 9 at 6:10 AM,4,"Worth the price, if you know what to do","This is definitely a freemium experience, but it can use a little more tweaking. The coaching and drills/workouts are varied and encouraging, and the leaderboards and combo counter encourage people prone to gamification and perfection to keep trying for a higher score, but it expects the user to know how to hit or throw a punch, with no tutorial or examples to follow. The coaches will offer reminders midway about remembering to rotate hips or where to put elbows, but it doesn't help if the user is already midway through a 20minute workout session when they're told ""remember to rotate your hips and follow through, then snap back"". It also focuses on jabs, straights, and body shots, but no crosses, hooks, or uppercuts, so this is more of a workout app than a boxing coach. 

However, as a workout app, it excels in getting you bouncing and your heart moving- because you're timing your punches instead of powering through, it seems to enforce cardio movements than strength, and some of the punch combos  are wild in their complexity. In the end, I enjoyed it so much that it legitimately made me consider purchasing the physical product (used, of course. This is a freemium app, after all)"
565,Funtimefoxy,Oct 7 at 9:15 PM,3,,It's a good game good for exercise but on the other hand premium is good to make money but it shouldn't be free for money and then let people import songs as well makes it better
566,Sue,Sep 18 at 7:57 PM,5,Wow,"I wasn't honestly expecting much from this game, but I got on it and it kicked my butt. Super fun way to get a workout in. Easy to set up and use. Will definitely be paying for the full game!"
567,Praterfamily,Oct 7 at 9:23 PM,4,,"This is such a fun game. I love how it shows you how to stand and have your hands. The Basic content is pretty good, the ten min workout kicks my behind!"
568,Stick,Oct 12 at 3:27 PM,4,Honestly a good fitness game for free,This is the best fitness game I have gotten on my vr on the free aspect of the game. You get a good bit for the free basic plan.
569,DJ Laylo,Oct 17 at 4:59 AM,5,My new favorite cardio,"Love this game, fun workout, love following along."
570,BigKuntry,Oct 10 at 9:27 PM,5,Great Workout,This workout is Amazing and better than going to the gym. I highly recommend it
571,Victoria,Oct 6 at 10:19 PM,5,Using this to lose weight,I love this game I do it an hour everyday and I am starting to lose weight and still build muscle.
572,Cristina,Oct 27 at 3:11 AM,4,Great app,wish all the free musuc wasn’t techno or house music.
573,Megan,Sep 7 at 9:38 PM,4,Good for the basics,I really enjoyed using the lite boxer app for the basics of punching. I’ve seen the pad be advertised before so I was excited that there was a digital version to use with the oculus. I only used the basic version but I tried a couple of the different workouts. It’s a good app but the only problem that I have with it was that sometimes the punches didn’t register correctly causing me to get a lower score. Overall I would definitely recommend the app for a great cardio workout.
574,GoldenGiver,Sep 18 at 4:44 AM,1,App issues,It will not allow me to move past the initial page of the sign up or log in page. I can't sign up at all.
575,Wheel,Sep 20 at 2:39 AM,4,Decent free boxing training app,Only had an hour on it so far but first impression is that it is very good for free. Personally I won't be subscribing to premium but I can see that it would be worth it to those who want a serious workout and to hone their boxing skills.
576,Ron,Oct 7 at 9:17 PM,5,Game is wonderful,I’ve been in situations where i had to defend myself so using this app helps me improve.
577,Badassduo,Sep 29 at 9:57 PM,5,Fun,I liked playing light boxer it was good exercise and it was fand it was fun and it did require you to focus I'll be playing a lot.
578,Derrick,Aug 26 at 10:55 PM,5,i love this app!!!,when i discovered liteboxer on facebook i wanted to try it and added yo library and downloaded tryed it and I LOVED IT!!! i like this app cause when you're controllers die u can just use hand tracking and the tracking is AMAZING!!! and i use my palms to play like the arcade game so for my its 10/10!!!
579,Eric B,Sep 10 at 11:54 PM,5,Free Version is a nice work out...,For beginners. This game has me sweating. Got my heart rate going. All without really noticing that I'm working out. I'm too busy trying to keep up and hit the right targets. Will definitely subscribe once I get better at it.
580,max,Oct 24 at 9:03 PM,5,good,good
581,Tracey,Oct 6 at 4:20 PM,3,Decent workout app,Seems very much like Supernatural but total body workouts in LiteBoxer are harder.  They don’t have any options to modify the workout for things you can’t do like lunges.
582,Bvoelker80Bvoelker80,Sep 13 at 11:21 PM,4,Lite boxer,"I like the game.  These games would be better if there was not a subscription plan for each game. I can't afford it. But it is fun so if you could have a 1 time price or a better version of the free one would help out alot, since everything is already to expensive."
583,Andy,Oct 8 at 1:27 AM,1,Absolute trash,Well just wanted to try out the free version. Won't even load pass the loading screen after signing up. Have uninstalled and reinstalled. Same out come
584,Seth Braswell,Oct 1 at 4:49 AM,4,LiteBoxer,This game is awesome I enjoyed playing a game while working out at the same time. It doesn’t have to bad of graphics but could get better. I just wish there was more free songs.
585,Prateek Chitnis,Sep 8 at 9:13 PM,5,Great VoRkout,"I normally go to the boxing gym, but recently I have a packed schedule and juggling a lot of things. I have started using the VR LiteBoxer and I am loving it! I am able to get my workout in and I can add that in during lunch time."
586,Jaxon,Sep 29 at 9:45 PM,4,Gives me the motivation to work out,"This is just what I was looking for.  Its easy to navigate and fun to do. I was struggling, trying to get motivated to work out and this gives me a little switch up through the week."
587,Wad3Wils0n,Oct 21 at 8:25 PM,5,Does what you want it to,Great work out
588,Jake,Sep 25 at 8:14 AM,5,Great for exercising and good fun,"This is a great VR experience that is fun as well as really good exercise.

I've only played the free version but have to say, it's really addictive."
589,Ladykie,Oct 12 at 3:51 AM,4,A free version for new users,"It's an app that helps with controlled fast, hard hitting targeted punches. The lessons are short so anyone can do them."
590,Christopher Bergene,Oct 17 at 3:25 PM,5,Great game,This is great even the free mode
591,Leah,Sep 2 at 4:24 AM,5,Great App,I enjoy the app. Its a fun way to personalize and customize your workout. You choose the intensity level and create a music playlist that allows you to fight to the beat of the music. It definately makes working out alot more fun and effective. 100% recommend!
592,Jake,Aug 24 at 9:09 PM,5,Fantastic arm workout,This app really gets you moving and gives you freedom to punch as you wish. I like to challenge my speed and accuracy with using one arm or increasing the difficulty for increased speed for both arms. The music even for the free option is decent and i plan to purchase the membership to unlock all the options.
593,RauschyFam,Oct 17 at 9:08 PM,5,Fun,This is a fun way to work out
594,Zombie,Nov 4 at 4:33 PM,2,Great work out,Changed to 2 stars as they have me a voucher that didn't work in the UK for my review.
595,Jason,Oct 6 at 12:38 AM,5,Great,Great excercise. I use the basic package but music isn't too bad. Overall very pleased.
596,Pietro,Oct 23 at 9:04 PM,4,Fun,It’s a good game but more song choices would be nice
597,NIKKIJ,Oct 16 at 10:29 PM,5,Pretty cool,Good exersice. Fun. Fast paced.
598,Savoie,Oct 20 at 12:40 AM,5,i like,i like this app
599,Josh,Aug 23 at 9:16 PM,5,Feels more than a workout,"This game feels more than just a workout, I feel that I can enjoy going at my own pace while feeling like I’m not working out as a chore. Being able to set goals on a leaderboard helps eliminate the mundane workout. I can feel accomplished and try harder each day to better myself. 10/10 for the app."
600,Toinette,Oct 23 at 12:04 AM,4,,Good Workout! I feel Premium is a little on the high side
601,April,Oct 14 at 9:43 PM,4,Fun App,"I enjoy this app, it is a good workout especially for your arms and punching is stress relieving."
602,Theresa,Sep 17 at 7:07 PM,5,Already Hooked,This is so much fun. I use the free version right now. The songs are definitely better with the paid as with most other apps. It’s easy to follow along and gets you moving.
603,Zed,Oct 13 at 11:06 PM,3,Pretty cool,This is a pretty cool app. I like the classes that incorporate music with the punching. The only downside is the price point.
604,Killian,Oct 16 at 12:16 AM,5,Free version,Great into to vr fintess for free
605,Ames,Oct 17 at 10:57 PM,4,Good quick workout,For just basic only it is a nice quick workout and it does raise your heart rate
606,Phippard,Sep 7 at 9:47 PM,5,Free version good for casual use,"I’ve been using the free version to try and gain a level of fitness back after no training for 12 months 
The game will keep you entertained from start to finish weather it’s just punching to music or a coach led class"
607,Twinnie,Oct 18 at 9:06 PM,3,Fun,I downloaded the free version and didn’t know what to expect but I have found it a fun workout.
608,dumbfreak,Sep 25 at 9:05 PM,5,Best App Ever,I feel like this is an insanely amazing app my 13yr old and myself both use it and gets us up and moving and feeling amazing......
609,Lorrie,Oct 10 at 3:14 PM,1,Install,"This game will not open, will not quit trying to open even after I hit quit and restarted my oculus. Super frustrating!"
610,Bentley,Oct 18 at 2:33 PM,5,Lite boxer review,Very good game
611,PatchWorkHero,Sep 27 at 10:00 PM,5,Easy simple jump right in,The app is easy to understand and navigate with a good variety of ways to work out with it's different session styles.
612,tripplet.2002,Jan 15 at 3:49 AM,1,Can’t start,"I tried to play but it asks me to create a profile.  I try, however can’t get pass the profile screen. Where’s the help button?"
613,Brad,Oct 25 at 9:02 PM,4,Nice workout,You get a nice workout out of this
614,Maddox,Sep 28 at 9:21 PM,5,Great game in general,This you can play free. And get fit really good and especially since I couldn’t find many free fitness games.
615,Tacocat,Sep 20 at 10:47 PM,5,Love it,"I only have the free/basic version. I love it so far, fun workout. Training runs seem legit thus far, looking forward to playing it even more tonight!"
616,Rob M,Sep 25 at 6:24 AM,5,Liteboxer is awesome,I was able to practice and learn easily how to punch accurately.  I'm curious about the subscription now!  Definitely a go to app!
617,Xinjie1st,Oct 7 at 7:17 AM,4,Great work out,Easy to use app. It is a great work out for me and it is free!  I know nothing about boxing. This app is fun and makes me move.
618,Tom Younger,Sep 26 at 3:15 PM,5,Quick workout,Great for the days when I don’t want to go to the gym but still need to do some sort of exercise! Great 15 workout !!
619,Islandsweetie,Sep 13 at 9:04 PM,5,,Just signed up and I enjoy this game very much. It took a few practices to get the concept but once I did it was so much fun! The music is diverse and it helps with the coordination.
620,ryley,Oct 10 at 10:35 PM,5,great game,it’s a nice fun game to play while your bored
621,Caygee,Oct 18 at 4:31 AM,4,Good workout,A little hard to follow at times but work out will humble most people
622,Baker45,Oct 8 at 6:13 PM,5,I need more of this,Tried this on a whim and now I’m addicted too much fun
623,Gustavo,Sep 21 at 5:26 AM,5,Great experience,This is one of the first apps that i choose as an exercise experience. A lot of possibilities as a beginner an good options without a suscription.
624,Sabre485,Oct 12 at 9:25 PM,4,Fun way to get started!!!,Great way to get started on working out and getting your technique down.  Liking it so far!!!
625,yallan99,Sep 22 at 11:00 PM,5,Liteboxer,Good workout.  Like how it not only works my arms but I can feel it in my hips.  Like the trainer that comes up to explain the workout.
626,Lisa,Oct 4 at 11:17 PM,4,Great app!,It's a great fitness workout from what I used as I only tried the free version. I think its a little over priced hence the 4 stars.
627,Mikey,Oct 5 at 9:02 PM,5,Excellent fitness app,Great fitness app can be difficult to navigate menus otherwise great
628,Alan,Aug 1 at 11:36 PM,4,getting back into fitness,Deciding to get back into a fitter lifestyle I thought about what games/apps on the quest might help me. I stumbled across this little gem and in living it. The range from a 1 song workout to a 15 min workout so far. Im sure tgere are longer ones but im not ready for them yet. The free option has many great options and doesnt feel as limited as many other games that offer free trials. seeing my hit my punch targets is great motivation to keep going and the fact it breaks me out in a sweat is great. Its my go to game at moment. Great hidden gem.
629,DoctorDonnaSong,Sep 1 at 12:22 AM,4,Definitely worth having,"I’m currently using the free basic membership and find it’s a really nice addition to my other workouts. I’ve used it to warm up for my main workout as well as at the end of the main workout when I needed to do just a little extra something. I’m still new to it, so time will tell if I will upgrade to premium, but I can already see it as a possibly. Definitely recommend."
630,Danykalifornya,Sep 18 at 11:06 PM,4,Very good exercise,The app is very entertaining the exercises have a very good quality and the graphics are really good but the problem is the subscription is expensive compared with other apps that have more different exercises.
631,Hernani,Sep 27 at 4:10 AM,5,Very Fun Workout App,"It's a very fun workout app. The songs are very nice too.
You can spend hours playing!!
Defnitely worth the try!"
632,Andrew,Oct 2 at 11:03 PM,5,good game,think its a good game. offers a good workout as well as good at working on combos
633,Alex Baccaro,Sep 28 at 2:00 PM,5,Free version,For a free version this app is excellent and a good way to start your journey into getting fit again
634,Logan,Oct 28 at 8:31 PM,4,Good,Decent
635,Amy Elizabeth Taylor,Dec 28 at 6:50 AM,4,Good BUT,"It’s good. I was excited about this. There are a few bugs though. It’s obviously new and developing, so I’m hopeful they’ll fix a lot of the small glitches. But a fun way to work out for sure."
636,Cull533,Sep 19 at 10:06 PM,5,Liteboxer VR App Review,Love this VR app. Liteboxer is a great exercise and you are having fun while playing it. Who knew working out could be fun! Highly recommended
637,Witchhouse4,Aug 18 at 9:30 PM,5,LOVE IT!,"This game is so much fun and total body workout! I broke my foot not too long ago and this was the first workout since I’ve done since healing and it had me going. I love the different intensity levels and strengths. I love how you can still view your living room and the game, so helpful with kids around!! I was dripping sweat by the end of this game!!! Totally recommend!!"
638,B,Aug 18 at 1:57 PM,5,Unexpected fun!,I was completely unsure of what I was getting myself into when I downloaded this game. If the gym isn't really your thing but want to get some cardio in this is the game to have! By the time I was done with 2 or 3 songs and then the 3 song challenge I was sweating like I just came from the gym likeable music that had me bouncing around as if this is what I do on a daily basis! I was in the top 500 out of 30000 according to when I played the 3 song challenge. If I can do it anybody can bc I'm not someone who would normally even think about doing something like this and I loved it!
639,Brewer1,Sep 30 at 9:46 PM,5,Brewer1,"Challenging workout, hand / eye coordination / and power of the punches.  I like it!!"
640,Harley,Oct 21 at 5:42 PM,3,I like the free version,I’m not paying money for this but the free one is pretty ok
641,Zeppah,Sep 14 at 10:07 PM,4,Free version works for me!,I checked out the free version. It seems to work fine and the setup seems logical to me. The only reason for the four stars is that I did not see any tutor. Never having box before I was really confused on what to do next.
642,hazzypigpro,Oct 13 at 9:35 PM,5,Great game,"warning, great game"
643,Kiantheocoplayer211MONKE,Feb 2 at 8:38 AM,4,,My son loves it!
644,Liam,Sep 20 at 11:49 PM,5,Just like real boxing,Don't need to go gym to train anymore this  is just as good . Clear Instructions from the coaches no need for a personal trainer 😁
645,Josh,Oct 9 at 3:00 AM,1,Bugged,"I HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY BECAUSE IT CRASHES TRYING TO START AND THEN I GET STUCK ON A BLACK S
SCREEN"
646,Plasman,Sep 14 at 1:19 AM,4,Randall small,I enjoyed lite boxer.it is a fun way to get a good workout for free with the basic  subscription. It counts punches thrown and landed.it also counts .Reminds me of guitar hero. If you like to box this is a good game to play.
647,Cory,Oct 18 at 10:09 PM,4,Fun exercise,Fun to do but gotta pay for anything really good
648,JenM74,Aug 17 at 2:02 PM,5,Great game for a fun workout,Was looking for an app to help get me moving and becoming a bit fitter. Found this and am really pleased. I've only got the free version but there is plenty on there to keep me going. Good fun playing the games and the trainer sessions are brilliant. Only a short session needed to break a sweat and feel great. Would really recommend.
649,Landens,Sep 4 at 1:58 AM,5,Didnt know what to expect,I didnt know what to expect with this app so I downloaded the free version. I quickly worked up a sweat while having a blast. Easy introduction and work up to more challenging excercises. Would definitely recommend.
650,Alex,Aug 18 at 8:38 AM,5,Great way to exercise,"First thing that caught my attention is how well this game tracks hands without controllers. In order to get the best results you must avoid direct or partial sunlight exposure to any of the cameras, but that should already be covered before you start the session. The game itself is pretty fun and after only two songs I could start feeling the effects of the workout. Would definitely recommend."
651,Alexis Theresette,Aug 26 at 4:26 AM,5,really surprising,"At first I had just downloaded it to test it, telling myself that it was basic but not, the game even in the free version are very complete and allows you to train well while having fun!
I really recommend it to those who want to discover a good VR boxing game"
652,Kristian Ceja,Oct 13 at 10:33 PM,5,Good fit game,Excellent game
653,AspectSolar,Oct 1 at 9:50 PM,5,Good game,I find that it's a very good game and the workouts feel good the day after
654,ClaireBear,Sep 3 at 12:56 AM,3,"Not Great, at least not for free","I haven't tried the paid subscription, but as far as the free version goes... improvements needed. First, there's really no tutorial to show people proper form when punching each pad. Second, even if there was a tutorial some of the more ""advanced"" levels go so fast I lose all sense of form in order to hit the targets on time. And third, of course, I wish there was more free content. I had great hopes for this app, hopefully they make improvements."
655,Indyah,Sep 21 at 9:10 PM,4,A fitness app that's worth it,I love this app apart from needing to having more music it's great. It actually makes me want to be active.And the routines are really fun. I've recommended to three friends already
656,John Bane,Sep 5 at 7:21 PM,4,Work our fun!,"I was skeptical at first, I was wanting a boxer to fight but the pad and the trainers and the music even on the free version was awesome.  You guys made me sweat! So I am gonna get the full version so I can get fit and not realize that I'm actually working out!"
657,Ian Scott,Sep 21 at 2:51 AM,1,Too easy,"This doesn't focus on technique, posture, or even your heart rate/pacing. If you want a fun game to move your arms to, play Beat Saber. If you want to learn more about boxing, go with FitXR."
658,SeanAndella,Aug 16 at 1:17 PM,5,Great first step into boxing!,"Learn to box and break a sweat! With wonderful work outs with trainers or use the paid subscription punch tracks with most every popular song out there today! In about 15 min you will feel the burn and.. this is a game you will definitely be on everyday 
A wonderful work out and great music! 
Great for if you want to get into boxing!
￼"
659,Br0zSquad,Aug 16 at 1:11 PM,5,What a workout!,"Love this would recommend to others! Great work out burned a lot of calories. When your doing the training it feels like a real trainer is there with you as you work out 
- ￼ All of my punches registered flawlessly. 
I have nothing bad to say about this.. please get it if you want to have a solid workout!"
660,iloveCake,Oct 6 at 6:24 AM,5,Great for building shoulders,"Tons of fun, even if it leaves me a little sore."
661,pizzabeast,Aug 26 at 9:03 PM,5,Great game I love it!,"Just got the game yesterday and have played it for hours, so much fun and makes you feel like your doing 2 things at once! I would highly recommend this game if your into music and if you want to burn some calories as well or just looking for fun!"
662,Jazzy,Aug 25 at 10:29 PM,5,Good game,"I really like the game and it’s not to intense at least on medium it’s not 😊. The game is easy to use and understand and the instructors are good as well, oh did I mention the music it’s really good but don’t take my word for it try it out"
663,RJ,Oct 1 at 9:36 PM,4,Worth the download and time,"I really like the developers idea on this product.
It is best fit for warmups and for someone who like to workout at home."
664,Que,"May 17, 2022 at 3:49 PM",5,Perfect Alternative,"Liteboxer has become a quintessential part of my weekly routine. There are days I can’t  get  to the gym, and my only alternative is the app. I love working on my combos while being able to get multiple punch workouts in. Also, the music selection is 🔥. It’s important that you know what you want out of the app, after the 7-day trial, you’re paying, and its a waste if you don’t use it."
665,Law,Sep 29 at 11:47 PM,5,Tons of fun and heck of a workout!,If you have 10-15 minutes to do a quick workout it's amazing. I love it!
666,Manson,Sep 18 at 3:06 PM,5,Good fun and free!,"Great game for people getting into fitness VR, they have multiple classes and types of games you can do. Would highly recommend"
667,Judy Keen,Sep 11 at 9:18 PM,5,New at VR Games,I liked that they have free version. I am lil older than most player and not knowing anything about VR it was easy to understand. So thank you for the easy access
668,Emile,Oct 12 at 5:21 AM,5,,Good workout
669,Marie,Sep 30 at 10:39 PM,5,Love this game/workout,I use this as my workout daily!! I love it and it keeps your stats
670,Jeyzahel,Sep 30 at 4:57 AM,5,Love it!!!,I am addicted to this!! I am motivated every day to play and excessive.
671,Zeck,Aug 15 at 6:28 AM,5,Great options for quick or full workouts,I've used several workout apps and I got to give it to liteboxer. How natural it feels to punch a pad that doesn't even exist yet my hand stops right as i strike the pad shows their impressive use of the vibration and visuals. The guided lessons are great but actually seeing a person for the mitt sessions are very engaging. The free version already has a lot to offer but i plan to get my full version soon.
672,Victor,Aug 14 at 9:18 PM,5,Great game or workout!!,"Personally, I LOVE liteboxer. I often to MMA in the mornings as a cardio session but sometimes I feel really groggy and look for ways to spice things up. That's where liteboxer comes in! It's a great game to play just for fun or as a workout!! It really gets that heart rate pumping and the trainers are extremely encouraging!!"
673,Domragger,Sep 17 at 9:04 PM,5,Brilliant for work outs,"The music is really addictive and keeps you entertained when working out , got the free version so far but considering upgrading."
674,God’s Child,Aug 25 at 11:34 PM,4,Free Version Great for Beginners,"I really like this app. I think the layout is nice, and the user friendly interface is great. The music selection is good, and though I’ve only tried two of the trainers so far, Max is definitely my favorite. I didn’t really like or understand why there wasn’t some sort of tutorial to show you that the green dots come from the middle and into whichever circle, and the other trainer didn’t really help with that either…so I was missing a lot of the new combos because I didn’t catch on until the whole combo was shown. But Max made it way easier to tell what’s coming next and what to expect. I also don’t really understand why you can choose a different song by the same trainer, only after completing one song first. Like, I wasn’t able to go straight to a different Max video until I redid a Max video I had already completed. Maybe I just don’t know how to work the app lol, which is why a tutorial would have been nice. Then again, I may have skipped through the tutorial so. Yeah. But I don’t remember a tutorial🤗"
675,Nakai,Sep 11 at 9:24 PM,5,Fun Game,The game is really fun and it’s a good way to workout. The way you have to punch to the beat of the song makes it feel like you’re not even working out.
676,Jaxson,Sep 23 at 3:54 PM,5,Surprised,"The app surprised me, I was expecting some sort of demo but it definitely make me break a sweat."
677,James HulkSmash Duran,Sep 22 at 4:17 AM,4,Great workout app,Like the workouts. But I wish they can do better in being able to challenge others. If they can update it to be able to find friends easier to invite in match ups.
678,Cit21,Oct 2 at 10:04 PM,5,Great workout,Gives a great workout and is great boxing practice
679,Lorraine6,Sep 23 at 3:20 PM,5,Enjoying the free version,I have only played it twice but really enjoyed it.  I plan on adding it to my exercise routine.
680,Steve Turner,Aug 14 at 6:53 AM,5,Great App !!,"I wasn't totally sure what to expect with this as I am very new to VR. Took a chance and bam !! Wow, this is fun, great work out. The first time I tried it for fun, I was sitting in my chair and I could feel the burn in my arms. It is fun to get your timing right and speed up. The movements really make a great workout and you can break a sweat and have fun doing it. I found this to be a addicting app with great tunes as well."
681,Andrew Holmes,Aug 13 at 9:57 PM,5,Energetic and Fun Workouts,"I wasn't expecting much from the basic package as I thought it would be poor to encourage the premium upgrade but I was wrong. 

I am a new user to VR and this app/game is easy to use, understand and play. It's very enjoyable with a good variety of workouts and tracks even when on the basic package. 

I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something fun."
682,Flare,Sep 19 at 1:31 AM,5,Great fun,"Its a fun game and you can work out while doing it, not a big section of free song but for free what you get is not bad"
683,Savage,Oct 2 at 12:10 PM,5,Great,Awesome have you on your toe great motivating Trainers
684,Dani,Sep 24 at 10:27 PM,4,New favorite game,"I got this game a week ago and it has quickly become one of my favorites. The only thing downside I see, is that I wish it had more song choices."
685,JasperSnoops,Sep 18 at 10:32 AM,4,Pretty cool,"I’ve only had a little go so far, but I intend to keep using it.
You hit pads to music. A trainer tells you which pads to hit, and you follow the instructions. A little workout"
686,lee,Sep 22 at 9:41 PM,4,Good for warmups and technique,"I will usually use this to warm up before my excercise, and its perfect, just wish there were more songs in the basic version that were more ""mainstream"""
687,Mike,Oct 4 at 9:04 PM,5,great for dieting,really good for weight loss and fun
688,cokeguy101,Aug 12 at 11:30 PM,5,Great to get moving,"I actually got the Quest 2 just for this! I was wanting a lite Boxer but the price was worrisome. ive had this about a week. I have used it for 4 days. I enjoy it and ince i grt back next week will do the monthly subscription to get mor content. i like that the free offerings do seem ti change every coiple of days and stay fresh. If you just use the free ap you cant get many trainer led sessions longer than 10-15 minutes.

great ap i will us it more and more"
689,Skittles,Sep 26 at 6:14 PM,5,Awesome workout,I felt my arms working out instantly and and love the programs and trainers

Very impressed with what this offers even if the free option"
692,Christy Softley,Sep 26 at 9:18 PM,5,WORKOUT,"GREAT WORK OUT FOR ALL AGES, AND ANYONE WITH LIMITED MOBILITY LIKE MYSELF"
693,Timo,Aug 23 at 10:01 PM,4,Not bad,"I'd thought I'd check it out, I'm in fairly good shape and thought well let me see the challenge in this. I casted it to the living room TV to see if the wife would get lured in. Sure enough she wanted to try. I must say this app is pretty engaging and fun. I really enjoyed it took me a few tries to get the rhythm but I got the hang of it. Still on the fence about doing the subscription. But the free version is great for a casual workout."
694,Asheena,Oct 1 at 8:51 AM,5,Amazing game,This game is awsome definantly getus heart rate up!!
695,tylan universe,Sep 28 at 10:19 PM,5,Love it!!!,Allows me to play and exercise at the  sametime..  Love it!!!
696,Nicole,Sep 11 at 5:35 PM,5,Boxing made fun!,Being able to be in the comfort of my own home and still have a trainer along with being able to box to music made it more motivating to exercise.
697,Edgar Cardoso,Sep 10 at 10:39 PM,5,Love the game,"This is a good interactive game with good graphics, sound and fun, now you can exercise yourself having fun at the same time. Just download and try it"
698,Dafam757,Oct 7 at 12:56 AM,3,Nice workout,Love the game... Workout is nice. My whole family enjoys the game... Good buy for the whole family..
699,Jupiter,Sep 11 at 9:08 PM,5,Exceeded expectations,I signed up for the free limited version and was actually really surprised how much I enjoyed it. It's great for a quick integration of cardio.
700,Drew,Oct 2 at 9:47 PM,5,Mr,Awesome app i love the punch workouts
701,Miranda,Sep 4 at 10:43 PM,5,Pretty fun,"I Iike the challenge, especially on hard lol. Me and my kids get a kick out of who can actually make it far without messing up. And on the plus side it is a workout. We love it."
702,Maureen,Sep 12 at 9:34 PM,5,Thank you to Liteboxet,This is a great app. It is very user friendly. The workout parts are broken into 3 minutes segments. And it is very easy to follow along.
703,Zamboni70,Oct 14 at 9:40 PM,3,Fun for all,Good way to burn some calories and have some fun doing it.
704,Riccardo,Sep 13 at 9:55 AM,4,Enjoy playing this game....,The experience of playing is pretty realistic and the VR trainers are integrated with the gameplay almost seamless. Really good enjoyable game / workout. Overall I would recommend this game....
705,Big G,Sep 20 at 1:31 PM,5,Amazing,Addicted! Used it every day for a week and am starting to feel so much better. Fantastic App.
706,Danielle,Aug 11 at 6:32 PM,5,Love the workout,Love the boxing programs on here. I also like the fact you don’t have to join the subscription they have options without it. The program offers different levels of programs easy to hard. And has energetic music to along with every workout. I am always challenging myself to get long streaks!
707,DzSponge,Sep 23 at 6:22 AM,5,Very good!,"It's great for exercise, really fun, I love the music, its a straight 10/10 for me!"
708,Max,Sep 15 at 10:24 PM,5,Good workout!,Very good for some exercise as well as blowing off some steam! Easy to follow and has a lot of great songs to box to.
709,Ian Zack,Oct 6 at 4:36 PM,5,,Awesome game
710,Cold Cheeto,Sep 9 at 11:43 PM,5,Better than I expected!,"I was skeptical of the way this game plays, But after trying it for a few goes, it’s￼￼ not bad. I say don’t knock it till you try it￼￼"
711,Youngs,Aug 18 at 4:11 AM,5,Good value!,I'd never used any sort of VR fitness game before but I saw a few videos of Liteboxer VR online and thought I'd give it a try.  Within a few minutes my blood was pumping and I was having fun!  I'd recommend it to anyone that is familiar with basic rhythm games.
712,Tashi,Aug 26 at 9:56 PM,5,So Far I Love It!,"I just used it yesterday and I’m sore as heck today, but it feels good. I like how the music is incorporated because it keeps me going. I do wish that for premium though, that there were more songs to choose from."
713,Bossman519,Sep 3 at 10:37 PM,5,Solid workout,I did the free trial for about an hour. worked up a hella tood sweat burned some solid calories and was genuinelly having fun doing so. the 15 min Rhythm workout is excellent.
714,QDiddy,Sep 5 at 9:49 PM,4,Great workout,Had fun and a great workout. Just wish they could slow it down a lil for beginners so you can  work your way up to doing advanced combos. Other then that a really good work out I try to put at least 5 hours a week into it
715,Kristian Lewis,Sep 19 at 3:32 AM,5,Amazing game,"This game really helped with my boxing in school , and it made me actually wanna do some exercise."
716,T.M.,Sep 1 at 3:47 PM,5,Shocked,I tried it on easy and was very shocked at the workout it gave me. I definitely will workout again. Hopefully soon I will be able to move to medium and then farther into the workouts.
717,Terri Peters,Sep 10 at 10:38 PM,5,Best workout!,I wanted to get the original boxing stand but it was too expensive.  When I saw this was on my oculus I am sooooo happy!! I love this app!
718,Reptilian12000,Sep 16 at 9:33 PM,5,very good,it helps me exercise so good I've been in shape on my top body and arm strength this ap is helpful thank you
719,KWQW-W9EV,Aug 20 at 9:50 PM,4,"Great workout,would like more free songs","Just wanted to try it out and it’s really fun to do the punch tracks. Will say would love to just buy the songs we want to use at least give the options for some of the premium songs to be purchased. I don’t have enough time to make a monthly subscription worth it to justify the extra monthly cost. 

Also would love to hear what the song is before hitting play so I can decide if I want to do that song. 

Just needs some tweaking but still very fun."
720,Owen,Oct 14 at 7:12 PM,4,Great app,Great for a quick workout
721,Fluffy,Aug 9 at 12:30 AM,5,Give it a try!,"I passed on this when it first came out because of all the bad reviews, and then decided to try the free version a few days ago. I am so glad that I did. It is fun and responsive and the music is so cool! I have other boxing and exercise games/apps as well, and this currently is my fun go to VR exercise! They really give you a lot to try in free version and I am contemplating a subscription but want to give it a little more time. I was only going to give 4 stars because of the subscription price, but what the heck, it is fun and nicely done. Thanks for the free try it version!"
722,OfBlackAndWhite,Sep 20 at 9:13 PM,4,Fun way to burn some calories,"This a great, entertaining, and upbeat way to be a little more active. Does a good job at keeping you sucked in enough to burn some calories."
723,Bunkerjames,Sep 14 at 9:35 PM,5,Free version,Haven't gotten the full version yet but so far the free version is very good and I would recommend to everybody.
724,Justme,Aug 21 at 8:38 AM,1,,"Not worth of money .  Tried to unsubscribe it but I couldn’t and now it’s said is not refundable.. 179.99 a year is a very difficult app and not enough trainer, music is horrible"
725,Dreamer805,Sep 25 at 9:37 PM,4,Good workout,"It’s a really good work out, you get your sweat on! Maybe a couple shorter ones. Very fun for anyone to try out."
726,Kamil,Sep 28 at 10:15 PM,4,Good for losing weights,Good for people who would like to start boxing/kickboxing training but they’re not confident yet.
727,Elaine,Aug 29 at 9:26 PM,5,,"I was a little intimidated before hand but I found it to be fun, easy and very helpful to get moving.  I also got in a nice little work out.  Looking forward to getting in some more workouts."
728,Luckystretchypants,Sep 4 at 1:11 AM,1,Never worked,Never got to play once. Crash after crash. Now I have to cancel my subscription before I get charged! Garbage!
729,Lori-Suzanne,Sep 19 at 10:26 PM,4,So far so good,"Just purchased and played a little. Liking it so far. Could use a little clearer directions/instructions for new players, but figuring it out."
730,Jeaneboop,Sep 12 at 10:14 PM,5,Great Stress Reliever,"I love to use this app when tense, It helps reduce tension by allowing me to knock the socks off of my digital opponent"
731,Dylan,Aug 27 at 12:41 AM,5,Amazing Free membership,The free membership is perfect and I love how they have trainers to help you burn calories and the music is good but it would be better if they had more recognized songs and more rap songs would be better
732,Cannonfudder,Aug 23 at 10:03 PM,3,Music and sweat.,"This is perfectly passable as a free workout.  Good encouragement and drill work, but it's just drills.  It's a great cardio workout, which is just what I'm looking for.  

 Combining this workout with other endurance boxers like creed or thrill of the fight is great fun.

I'm not sure I want to subscribe, I want to use it linger first"
733,Lena,Aug 29 at 10:18 PM,5,Makes working out fun!,i was able to make a playlist of all the songs i enjoy on their app and it gets you really in the mood to work out and not realize the hour has passed! plus its a great price for the year!
734,desiree,Sep 12 at 9:03 PM,5,LiteBoxer YAY,We just got our VR and downloaded this game.  No issues.  We absolutely love it! Me and my granddaughter Jane a blast!
735,Bivins,Sep 8 at 1:26 AM,5,Fun !,I really enjoy Liteboxer. Its fun and I definitely broke a swear. I did wake up a little tight bc I was moving parts Ive never moved before!

739,Korzeo,Sep 13 at 9:38 PM,5,Satisfied,I was looking for something quick and easy that I could do at home and this has everything I was looking for.
740,Cody Mackay,Sep 27 at 8:51 AM,5,Great,Very good if you want to get your fitness up
741,Cassie,Sep 22 at 1:49 PM,5,Great Workout,App definitely challenges you. It’s fun for the whole family!
742,WeedVulture,Sep 17 at 2:31 AM,5,Fun game,Overall I rate it 5 stars because it's fun to play while losing some weight at the same time
743,meow,Aug 9 at 4:46 PM,5,Sessions,Honestly I like this a lot and its really refreshing to do even a 5 min session what i like the most is how it doesn't force you to pay for it but still has open selections for free although it is a little bugged with the punching  but it might be just for me I still recommend lol
744,Jose Zavala,Sep 11 at 11:03 PM,5,Real Workout and fun,I had seen an ad for lite boxer on TikTok and when I downloaded the app it had immediately exceeded my expectations.
745,pavolko28,Sep 22 at 4:36 AM,5,Lots of fun,Just got this and it's awesome! So much fun and a great work out!
746,Sam,Aug 6 at 5:10 AM,5,Great free workout,"I'm a very busy person and it's hard to find a workout that fits my schedule. With this, even though it's just the basic plan I still get a great workout. I love how there's someone there to motive you and the music is pretty decent. Maybe in the near future I'll get the full version, but as of right now basic is all right."
747,Derick,Aug 6 at 7:30 AM,5,I’m hooked,"I heard about this online and it was my first download, I took the free 10 minute workout and it was so much fun, didn’t even realize you are working out until you are done and realize how much you are sweating. I’m likely going to join the full program, I can see it as a great tool to get in a fun workout. Such a great app! 

Derick"
748,ChaosHollow,Sep 18 at 3:08 AM,5,Very great app,This is a very great app and I enjoy using it in my workout routines🔥🔥🔥🔥
749,abby,Aug 21 at 4:48 AM,5,Free Version Review,The free version of this game has been an absolute blessing!  I was so excited to learn about this game and especially excited when I heard there was a free version.  Your arms will definitely be burning but it’s worth it!
750,Morgan,Sep 16 at 4:43 PM,5,Awesome!,"Awesome workout and songs! Enjoy getting on this app every day for a great, fun exercise!"
751,Precedent1014,Aug 21 at 9:16 PM,2,Needs work,"I was excited to use the app but disappointed. It gave me no real instructions. It didn't take long to figure out what I needed to do. But once it stopped, the music kept playing. I kept waiting for more but it was just the music playing. I'll give it a couple more tries but I'm not too excited about continuing. I'm hoping it gets better."
752,Jace,Oct 3 at 10:30 PM,4,Zach s,Fun game and a good way to stay in shape and pass the time.
753,YPanicker,Aug 21 at 10:11 PM,4,Fun way to learn and sweat,"Ive not done boxing before, but the trainers in the app are good. You dont have to be an expert to do what they say. There is a subscription fees but there are a few free videos too, and you can track your activity. One of my few complaints is I cannot move the pad you hit."
754,Zumi,Sep 26 at 10:33 PM,5,,It is a fun game if you like boxing.
755,Katherine Green,Sep 10 at 12:08 AM,5,Nice free version,It seems like a great workout and different coaches with speed etc...I really enjoyed it I might buy the premium version
756,Ainz,Sep 14 at 9:39 PM,5,Great workout,"Really like this app, lots of choice on even the basic version and gives a really good workout."
757,Dreamfinder,Sep 26 at 1:46 AM,3,Ok Needs Improvement,"The UI seemed odd, could not find many workout. And it didn’t seem to get my heart rate up like some other VR workouts"
758,Matthew,Aug 29 at 12:47 AM,4,A free workout,This is a great app for exercising and a good way to learn how to box but the reason i get it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the free version doesn't have many exercises and I would like a bit more but other than that it's a great game
759,he snapz,Sep 15 at 2:50 PM,5,Get in shape,This game will make you sweat and get in shape NOT TO MENTION great selection of music!!
760,James C. Marler,Sep 15 at 3:21 AM,5,Awesome app!,This is great if you don't have time to go to the gym and its a lot easier on your hands too!
761,Pride Family,Sep 14 at 11:28 PM,5,Liteboxer Review,This is a very fun game and I love the fact that there are songs available for the workouts.
762,JUSTIN,Sep 22 at 12:51 PM,3,Decent,"Solid game , great top tier soundtrack. Punch markers seem of sync or off beat sometimes. A lot of room for improvement great concept"
763,MAD Moose,Oct 11 at 7:56 AM,1,,Free version will not load
764,Vik,Aug 3 at 9:36 PM,5,Great workout even for the 'free' users,we downloaded this as a family and now we have become pretty competitive. we've not had it long but we are enjoying it. You can purchase monthly or yearly subscriptions but we are just using the free option at the moment. The songs on there for the free users are pretty catchy and definitely something for everyone.
765,MJ,Aug 3 at 11:04 PM,5,Great choice for fun FREE workout!,"This game has a free version for casual users and is easy to use. It actually trains you while you are having fun and literally working out!! 
It gives you targets to hit the whole time encouraging you to keep going. I love the one where you choose from a list of songs and workout for the duration of that song. It keeps track of your accomplishments as well. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to learn to box, work out, and have fun all at the same time."
766,ItsWizz,Sep 3 at 2:31 PM,4,Love the Trainers beside me,"I really enjoy the Trainers talking me through the workout. Keeps me focused, & pumped. I also enjoy how simple they keep it. The progression in workouts are steady & make me feel somewhat accomplished."
767,RusBigGunsMcGraw,Sep 20 at 11:21 PM,5,Great game,Love playing this game. Great exercises you can do anytime.
768,Matt,"May 5, 2022 at 11:33 PM",5,THERE IS A FREE MEMBERSHIP OPTION NOW!!,"I hope that grabbed your attention!

If you gave this program a low rating before because of the price, or you were hesitant to try it because of the price, try the free version out now. They’ve done so much work on this game in the past month - its great!!"
769,Riverkeeper,Aug 2 at 9:28 PM,5,Good honest sweaty fun!,"Got back into my quest after a while of it sitting on a shelf. Decided I needed something to help get me moving again. This turned up and I downloaded it. The free content is really good, plenty to get you started. Good haptic feedback so it does feel like you have hit a pad. The virtual instructors are good and the free visuals good. Not tried the paid content yet but it looks like there is a lot in there to keep you body combat happy."
770,Janet,Sep 19 at 9:29 PM,5,Loved it!!,Great workout and really fun. I'm so glad I got it 👍 🙌
771,SuperIdol949,Sep 26 at 3:24 AM,5,Very fun,Very good app for working out
772,Issac,Sep 11 at 9:37 PM,5,Boxing,"Boxing app is great 
My son really liked it and got a great work out for it 
Def worth recommending"
773,Tisadas4,Sep 8 at 4:04 PM,5,More enjoyable than I expected,This experience turned out to be a ton more fun then I thought it would be! We will be starting a subscription.
774,Michael Gazerwitz,Aug 28 at 5:15 AM,5,Great boxing Workout,This app simulates boxing and gives you an amazing work out.  The song selection is amazing and deep and makes working out with this program addicting I give it 5 Stars!!!
775,Bryseida,Sep 15 at 7:08 AM,5,,Definitely a great way to workout and jam out all in one :) definitely recommend
776,Dree,Aug 1 at 11:31 PM,5,Great Workout! Even for Older Adults.,I really enjoy this Lit Boxing since its challenging and fun. My hubby is 65 plus and finds the instructions easy to follow. Wish the targets vould fladh numbers with punching. It easy to follow and catch on to the routines. Treat yourself to a fun workout with some sweating. We appreciate the free version and might upgrade. Hope to free version put more workouts into the app. We will recommend to our  friends and family.
777,PWE6500,Sep 24 at 3:48 PM,5,Nice,Easy to use and great cardio
778,Boltieboi,Aug 8 at 11:37 PM,5,a fun workout,"Its a fun yet simple workout activity i highly recommend this app if you want to work out, lose weight, or just simply learn to box. There are some slight issues with the hit boxes but these bugs aren't that big of a deal since you can work your way around them."
779,Breac,Aug 17 at 11:05 PM,5,AMAZING APP,I just got my oculus a week ago and have already seen durastic improvements to my boxing and i would highly recommend this app ( ITS FREE ) i wiuld have happily paid up to £20 for this game but i dont need to. 10/10
780,Brian,Aug 1 at 5:46 AM,5,Good start to an Excellent workout app,"This app shouldn't be confused as game app more of a fun workout app. One thing to consider is this workout app may not be for everyone  we all have our favorite activities we do best at. Some sort of fun physical exercise we like doing. If boxing catches your eye or like the challenge of boxing in any style this workout app could be for you. It is a form of sport training that if you enjoy it than you may favor this app.
I am enjoying it so far it is quite different than just hitting a heavy bag or going to a kick boxing class. I see from the reviews some mixed feelings to this workout app. Don't  let negativity effect your try and seeking for yourself if you like it or not they have a Basic plan that is free to use so that you really don't  have anything to lose.

Some things I like to see in future of this workout:
I know at start of the workout the instructor give you some basic instructions for the particular workout. 
But  I like to see a tutorial and practice sessions  separately to be able  to get a better feel of the lite boxer. So we see more of good hits and bad its also  Is gaging distance we should be at the light boxer.

If we owned the Light box stand or wall  we have the ability to add number stickers to it until we get acquainted with the light number position. It be nice to see an option in setting to put a number overlay on the light boxer this way we can easily acquaint ourselves with the light boxer.

I think it be nice to have voice  command added.

That would  be my only suggestions I have to an already start of an excellent  workout  app.

Keep up the good work in your Lite Boxer VR
Brian"
781,Joe Kem King,Sep 27 at 9:49 PM,5,Great Program,I love it!
782,Eamkie,Aug 6 at 5:17 AM,5,Free Version is amazing,"This game is pretty good especially now that you can play without having to apply for the membership. 

It is easy enough to catch up to in the Easy Mode. It let's you know how you're streaks are going and doubles your points. 

Super fun and song choices keep me energized!"
783,MannaOne,Aug 22 at 9:16 PM,5,Makes working out fun!,Great music to box to with just enough challenge to keep you coming back for more. I was impressed with the simplicity of the interface and the fun factor of trying to beat my best score!
784,HekG,Aug 30 at 2:42 AM,4,Work it!,This VR app has helped me jumpstart my weight loss regimen! I love that I can just use the demo for the time being and once I’m ready to ramp it up I have the option to pay for a monthly subscription￼. ￼
785,Zander,Sep 18 at 10:11 PM,5,,Great fun workout game that makes me wanna workout
786,Riley,Aug 28 at 10:32 PM,5,Really great,"Great easy to follow cardio workout, this makes excercise fun! If you haven’t got the confidence to go to a group/gym this is a really great alternative!"
787,Razla,Aug 11 at 7:36 AM,4,Decent work out,"This game gives a decent little workout.  Broke a good sweat within a few minutes. 
I really enjoy having a person there with the pads to make the workout more interactive.
Understanding its a boxing game would love to see some legs being incorporated 
I have just however played a few of the free workouts"
788,Santiago,Aug 8 at 10:51 PM,5,Fun free to play,Got it as there are few free games on quest and I use this daily before workouts to warm up and in-between my bigger workouts to keep my cardio up the mix of music into a great boxing game has made me lean towards paying more to get the full experience
789,Minsoo,Jul 29 at 9:12 PM,5,Free version + Sweaty!,"I was looking for a great fitness app and this really caught my eye. In this game it has a free version and I used the free version. The free version was perfect! It had instructors that make you really warm up to the beat/rhythm of the song. Within 10 minutes, I was already sweating and enjoyed it! My muscles were really sore! 😂 My final opinion is that there are better options but if you want to be on a real budget, this is a good app to really exercise the upper part of your body such as your arm muscles! Doesn't make you any stronger though.. Probably just a me thing. LOL!"
790,SpiderAlex,Aug 28 at 9:56 PM,5,Perfect for a casual workout,"The free version is just perfect if you wanna try something new, makes you feel good about yourself and maybe try the premium mode without any regrets"
791,ItzTree,Sep 22 at 8:22 PM,4,Fun fitness game,Definitely adds fun to working out with the music and the classes are pretty good
792,Shaeshae,Aug 3 at 12:23 AM,5,Love it,I absolutely love this app. I have a hard time committing to anything active but when I found liteboxer I became hooked. I love being able to box/workout to some of my favorite songs. I absolutely recommend this app to anyone wanting to stay active and have fun at the same time
793,XtreamXTC,Aug 9 at 2:55 PM,4,Prepare for a workout!,"It's still early days for me in my LiteBoxer journey, but the concept and execution is excellent. I've tried a number of the different routines and found the trainers engaging and always come away from a session sweating, and I'm using to training and cardio 3-4 times a week!

The only reason for downrating this to 4 start is the subscription price, I do think this is a barrier to many. I think a slightly lower price for the service would attack more people and probably end up being more profitable IMO - what I can't argue with is how fun it is and how much of a workout you get - I'd really like them to release some VR gloves that would be awesome. I'm also a sucker for stats and data and this provides loads, including where you are in the % of users, so always strive to go back to workouts and do better to rank higher, which is great for motivation."
794,Ryan Oaks,Oct 3 at 4:09 AM,4,Fun,"Really fun, exciting workout."
795,Rondukes215,Jul 28 at 9:59 PM,5,Great Workout and very motivating,"I absolutely enjoyed my time with is app. It may seem simple (6 targets, how hard can it be, right?) but I really enjoyed it as to me, it's like hitting the mitts. So imagine my surprise when they had Mitt Workouts which are motivating with great cueing from the coaches, leaderboards, accuracy tracking, and if it get to the end of the day and my calorie target hasn't been reached, I'll go through a few songs or do a 3 song mitt workout (my faves so far) Love it and I hope they keep adding to it."
796,Catherine,Aug 21 at 3:43 PM,1,Cancel my subscription!!!,I have emailed three times and tried to follow the directions and have not been able to cancel the subscription. You have charged me for almost a year. Cancel it now!￼
797,Charly,Sep 20 at 12:09 AM,3,more tracks 4 free,it's a good app and love it. The pads seem to be a little low and no idea how to move it up and sometimes too close.
798,therealmamachaos,Aug 25 at 4:41 AM,5,Loving it!,"Just got the basic version right now and loving it.  Gives me a good workout. Will probably buy the premium version eventually, but for now the basic is enough."

801,Azh,Sep 22 at 12:05 AM,5,Brilliant,Highly recommended
802,ManofDogs,Jul 30 at 2:12 PM,5,A captivating and enjoyable workout,When i first saw that to use this app you had to create an account i was sceptical but as soon as i signed up i found out it was definitely worth it. The selection of music is incredible and the wide range of coaches are also useful to show you how to properly complete the exercise.

804,Parth patel,Aug 22 at 9:03 PM,5,Liteboxer,This app has helped me out a lot and is also a great way to stay active. Honestly who needs the gym when you can have apps like these that help you stay active and fit
805,Christine,Sep 14 at 9:09 PM,4,Would like more basic training,"It's one of the faster ways to burn calories, I would like more basic training and some geezer music. Thanks"
806,Breezzedidit,Sep 5 at 1:13 AM,5,Highly addictive,Very good app extremely fun and the interaction is awesome with the trainers highly recommended 👌
807,SheGottaBigButt,Sep 4 at 9:56 PM,5,A whole new boxing experience,I absolutely love this workout.  Comfort of your own home snd unlike any other workout I have tried.
808,Kingpayne,Jul 26 at 10:04 PM,5,This is a solid game,This game is fun and super good if your looking for a nice little workout. I play Liteboxer frequently and I would say it’s pretty user friendly. If I had one complaint it would be that it’s a little hard to focus on the punching area with the trainer right in front of it. Apart from that this is a great game and I would recommend to anyone looking to have a good time while still getting exercise.
809,Liam,Sep 13 at 9:03 PM,5,5* App,Easy to use app and just started out and is good so far
810,Lake,Aug 12 at 3:26 AM,5,Great For Exercising,"Great Game for exercising, although sometimes it wouldn’t track my movement, but not sure whether that was the app or the actual quest. Regardless very nice app to stay active while also staying motivated with music."
811,Jertetris,Sep 5 at 9:20 PM,5,Fun while keeping you active!,this is my favorite app on the quest. its really fun and keeps you active while training you
812,Acroyear01,Sep 21 at 4:40 AM,4,Lite boxer,I like it so far. You. A good way to get  a quick fifteen minute workout!
813,Mike,Jul 25 at 9:06 PM,5,Top notch workout,I've tried other boxing workouts and this one is more laid back and fun cuz you get to hit with the beat. Great song selection and getting to pick your song makes it more fun than having to go through other songs just to get to the one you want. You can pick the level of hardness on each workout and the instructors aren't annoying like on other apps.
814,Diego,Aug 12 at 1:55 AM,5,Honest review,"This game is actually really fun, the songs in the premium membership are great and I hope they add more soon. The games pretty fun to play and very tiring, but with the amount of songs in this game im impressed."
815,TopG,Sep 15 at 2:16 AM,5,Really fun,Good workout and while listening to music

Great workout!!"
820,Fred Pacheco,Aug 20 at 1:20 PM,5,Nice way to exercise,I like the app! It offers many lessons with personal trainers that motivate and a  good interface to practices punches. It's cool and funny and effective to sweat.
821,Wasi,Sep 4 at 5:04 AM,4,Nice,I got a free version to try the game. It was above my expectations. Easy interface and nice punching sequence training along with lively soundtracks.

825,Honeyform,Aug 26 at 10:32 PM,5,,I think it is a great app & it's free! You have basic training and workouts that will  have you really working out and sweating.
826,Sid,Aug 3 at 4:46 PM,4,Great start to get you into boxing.,I have started with the free version. they have good tracks and limited traininf and sparring seasions. It is great that it takes into account the timing and the velocity of your fist going into the pad. i wish they had more tracks a available. You can compare your scores and have a match woth your friends. Still trying hard to convince my friends to come on Oculus. I am. casual user now. I play on another game to burn 300cals everyday. I might shift to playing this every alternate day.
827,Mocha,Sep 11 at 9:03 PM,4,Pretty good boxing game for beginners,I have only played for abit and it taught me alot already. It really sharpened how I box and I like it :)
828,Anthony Andella,Aug 12 at 10:45 PM,5,Great Investment!,Wow what a game so much fun with just a great selection of music to chose from for a great price! Get that groove and move on when playing this! Don’t be lazy when playing vr get up and grab this
829,one4allsog,Aug 12 at 12:42 PM,5,Awesome and efficient,I love it. A nice fun way to exercise and train. The music is great and the coaches are amazing. Who knew exercising and training could be this fun. The ranking list is added modavation. Thanks!!!

But  I have worked out on the boxing four days and each day I can tell a difference  eye coordination and getti g me move faster to hit targets at same time working up a sweat and burn  Calories. This might be for everyone but for me it works.

838,Dyllan,Aug 26 at 9:03 PM,4,Great game with lots of song to choose!,"This game is an incredibly fun and musical game. You can work out, and still have it be fun!
There are quite a few songs to choose from, but it would be better if there were more"
839,Hugo,Jul 22 at 6:21 AM,5,I really liked the app!,"I felt the difficulty levels really exist. I started straight on the hard mode and didn't do very well, I had to go back to the easy level to train my coordination and then evolve. The learning curve is great!
I was surprised because I got tired after an exercise session! I felt like it demanded more of me than other similar apps.
Finally, the class with the coach accompanying is very cool, it gives the feeling that there is really someone with you in the room!
Totally recommended."
840,Lee,Jul 26 at 10:52 AM,5,Great Workout for Kids and Adults,"I never thought I would be into a boxing game, but I made a great decision to try this one out. I and my 11-year-old daughter get a great workout and boy do we sweat playing this. I've lost weight and so has my daughter. I will be signing up for the premium after my trial has finished. Highly recommend."

Lite boxer has helped me take a handle on my anger issues and helps me relieve my stree."
844,GrannyB,Aug 1 at 9:42 PM,4,Good exercise for older person,"Even though this is a great app for young people to get a good workout in the boxing world; it is also a great way for the older person to get up and moving without being too extreme. And being on fixed income there is no pressure to get a subscription, but still different enough music, etc to stay interested with what's in the library.  I'm a 50+ woman and I like the workout it gives me, but I would like to see a little more movement for the lower body. But I haven't been using long so maybe at different levels there is; I'll have to wait till I get there. But all in all I like the workout it gives me."

848,I stole your toast,Jul 23 at 11:50 PM,5,Fun and a hella workout!,I downloaded the free version for my 9yo to get in a little extra exercise. He loves beat saber and this is similar enough to hold his attention for a few minutes. I tried a few workouts and it was fun for me too. Finally something the family can do together (because no Roblox for me).
849,KWill,Aug 31 at 3:09 AM,5,Excellent exercise experience,Love this game it gives you a hell of boxing working and teaches you proper technique as well .

854,Pocomocoloco,Aug 29 at 11:25 PM,4,Very fun,i enjoy this app a lot. it gives me a good cardio workout and gets my heart pumping. but the only problem is that i sweat a lot so mu lences become foggy.
855,Diego,Sep 6 at 12:05 AM,4,Very Useful,This app is very good if you want to exercise but it is always telling me to but the premium version for lots of money.

861,Jeffwise,Jul 21 at 1:28 AM,3,Updated review: Improved a quite a bit.,"UPDATE (7/20/22)
Looks like they added a free mode and improved the Ui. It is lacking content, but hopefully it improves more. Added two stars ⭐️  for this. Will see how the next update(s) go and re-review.

———


Its a boxing fitness app that charges you hundreds of dollars to utilize it longterm. If you want that and music licensing, get this. If not, give it a pass.  

LES MILLS is better one time pay fitness app. look it up.

To Devs: No one cares about the music, dont waste money and ours on these things. Just deliver the app for one price, with DLC or Season passes. We already have a weak market of subscription apps, that trend will eventually implode."
862,Paul,"May 17, 2022 at 5:25 AM",5,Punch it out,Living in a hectic world I am enjoying the release of stress after going a few rounds with my Virtual Lite Boxer. Updates keep the system new and exciting and coming from the days of boxing in a gym this has been a great tool for me and enjoy using in the comfort of my home. Also the portability of this is great and look forward to each day and each new feature experience as they continue to update.
863,Bradley,Aug 20 at 9:06 PM,5,Looking for fitness,This is a great app that is easy to use and really gives you a good workout. It’s affordable and it’s fun. I highly recommend it. ￼

if MUSIC and EXECUTION of workouts are the 2 most important part then this app is for you. Im only on my 2nd day but ita already a staple to my daily routines now and I plan to keep it and pay the monthly. Try it! 

The workouts are fun and the music is dope!"
873,Christian Morales,Jul 18 at 5:23 AM,5,So far amazing,I recently got a Meta Quest and was looking for an exercise app that wasnt extremely expensive. Downloaded this one based on the free tier and i am hooked. I love rhythm based games and combining boxing with reflexes here is super fun. The coaches guiding you is really cool and keep me going. From what I have seen the music selection is also great. Great game to stay active at home.
874,Emma,Jul 17 at 10:12 PM,5,One of the reasons I bought an Oculus,I really wanted to floor model of LiteBoxer but I didn’t want to spend the money so when they came out with the VR version I just knew I had to finally pull the trigger and get the Oculus. I really like the song tracks and I recently tried out the trainer led workout and I really felt like I had a good workout and my arms were sore the next day! Lol! So far it seems like the membership is worth it because I’m having a lot of fun so far :)
875,Eridus,Aug 23 at 9:05 PM,4,Free version is a good workout,"Only used the free version so far but the workout is well planned and has different levels for all abilities.
Looking at buying full version for the full options it gives."

Honestly can say it’s super fun, the price per month is a little steep for my preference but it’s a fun way to work up a sweat. If the price weren’t the same as I pay for a gym memebership I would definitely continue to workout every week with it. For now I will use the free version."

878,chaim,Jul 1 at 6:53 PM,5,Real Fitness + Real Fun,"If you can't get the Liteboxer device at home, this app does a great job of bringing the boxing experience into the home in a fun and enjoyable way. Here are some of my favorite parts of the app.

Punchtracks - a ton of songs to choose from in a wide array of musical genres with new ones added all the time.

Mitt drills - feels like working with a personal trainer. Hit the mitt while the trainer encourages you

Stats - see how well you are doing

Feedback - company loves to listen and learn what is working and adjust accordingly

and more!

The only complaint I have heard about the app is that it isn't a fun game. While it is fun, there isn't a game to play. This is for people who want to have fun boxing or get in a real workout."
879,AD,Sep 8 at 9:42 PM,5,nice!,I really enjoyed this new app!
880,Rosa,Aug 2 at 9:39 PM,5,Great app,Barely got the app a few days ago so I can start getting back into the fitness world and lite boxer really is the way to go. Do a 10 minute workout and you will feel a burn I've already lost weight. Its a great app!

I went back a 2nd time and ended up doing 4 workouts, the last 2 without a coach. 
Much better."

894,Nosnevets93,Jul 14 at 11:51 PM,5,NOW FREE!,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Hope that got your attention!!! While it’s only a couple dozen songs, doing them of different difficulties makes it challenging. Great small space workout and I love being able to do a quick 10 minute work out and pushing myself trying to get a faster velocity. It’s free, give it a shot! 

Fairly accurate targeting and speed. It would be nice if they added hooks into their programs and angle the bottom left/right targets for this “advanced” feature. Maybe even upper cuts / stomach jabs being angered down for the bottom target. 

I wish they would offer a military or first responder discount for their premium but maybe it’ll be offered eventually."
895,THE TEAM,Sep 3 at 4:05 AM,5,Awesome app,I need to learn how to fight perfect app for that
896,Mommaboss,Aug 20 at 3:17 PM,4,Free version,The free version is good. There are different workouts from 3 minutes to 15 minutes. My left arm is not as strong as my right are and the workouts helps strengthen my arm.
897,Shiskabob SquarePants,Aug 12 at 6:04 AM,5,awesome,this app is awesome.. i love working out with this.. it shows your progress and calories burned amd everything.. a+++.. its a must get if you want to exercise
898,Guywhoneverstreams,Jul 25 at 11:12 PM,4,A Great at Home Cardio Experience,I got this on a wim and I have to say it beats the boring at the gym treadmill run or even machine rows! I feel great while doing it and get to jam out at the same time. The only big complaint I have is the membership cost being 18.99 a month or 172ish a year because that seems steep but it does include workouts and copyright music so. 8/10 would recommend!
899,Luka,Aug 31 at 10:25 PM,5,So cool!,It is just what I needed!!! I can’t get enough of it!!!
900,Knockout,Sep 21 at 1:09 AM,3,Decent,Good for if u have a bit of spare time
901,MadNightmare320,Aug 1 at 8:29 AM,5,Fun workout,Was looking for a workout app and came across this. I really enjoy boxing and love games that play to music so this was the best of both worlds. Paid version is awesome but the free version is great too. Highly recommend.
902,N1CKCLUHG,Jun 28 at 10:12 PM,5,"HECTIC LIFESTYLE, EASY WORKOUT!","So purchased this app so i could add some sort of exercise into my lifestyle, being a chef, a carer and a parent i hardly find time to get out and look after myself. Originally bought it for that exact reason, but turns out its a great app to burn off the negative / stress filled days. If you want something easy to access and want to get some sweat on then at least give this a go. The music helps get you through the session, and it isn't some generated tosh that some other programmes choose.. it's from actual artists and there is plenty to choose from. The trainers are active and incourage you to continue .. Honestly its healthy option without the massive dent gyms can leave in your bank account."
903,Diana,Jul 14 at 7:15 AM,5,Excellent work-out app,"I'm coming here after having worked out with Fitness Boxing on the Switch for a couple of years, and I cannot believe the difference. It's much more intense, the music selection is better, and I work up a sweat really quickly.

I've only just started using it, but I'd recommend it to anyone. It might take a while to get used to the pace (it feels very fast to start) but it's a lot of fun!"
904,Abbie,Aug 11 at 9:01 PM,5,Love the workout,"I had initially thought￼ that since it was vr it wouldn’t be much of a workout. I was so wrong, 15/20 mins of this and I’m sweating. Love ￼this!"
905,IceyBlues,Aug 4 at 9:36 PM,5,it WORKS OUT,Honestly trying to get more active while im at home and this helps out. started at medium difficulty and only pushed through 30 mins. its also entertaining and the music choice is decent
906,TheNif,Aug 25 at 10:16 PM,4,Gamxercise!!!,"This was fun to play, and I liked that I felt like I had done a workout after.
Please add support for song selection on the basic version."
907,Paul,Jul 12 at 10:03 PM,5,Surprisingly Good,"Need to get fit and healthy?

Like hitting stuff, while some incrediy fit and healthy man or woman encourages you? 

Then this is for you.

2 options, subscription or free. I am currently on the free, a large number of tracks and drills. Easy to pick up and does its job making you sweat. 

Would recommend and am likely to go for the paid version in the near future."
908,COWBOY FROM H3LL,Jul 13 at 1:13 AM,5,"Good app, got the family involved","Picked this up after watching videos of people using the actual litebox stand and thought id give this a try.  Very much worth the price.  I have played around with it for a few days now, the family has tried it and liked it.  

Im not sure if I havent discovered it or not yet but it really needs an option to be able to use your own music. There is about 20-25 songs that the family likes I am about 10-15 liked.  Not sure who picks some of the slow jam R&B songs but you need to add more rock/metal to the selection.  Work out a deal like guitar hero and let us buy dlc packs with songs we would like and you just offer another source for artists to make money."
909,Empress Junebug,"May 14, 2022 at 5:01 PM",1,Boring and expensive,"Don’t waste your time. There are so many boxing games in VR that are so much more fun and better executed than this one. I was so excited to try it and was so let down by every piece of it. 
Not worth a subscription- the box your hitting doesn’t register your punch unless you are 100% lined up with the light that tracks it. You have to listen to the “trainer “ for a minute or more every time you log on a game.
Now I have to figure how to cancel this before they start charging me. 
I’m"
910,cvan,Jun 4 at 5:36 PM,1,Account required to try it? forget it.,"I'm all about fitness games. Subscription or not, I'll check them out and if I like it, will happily pay. But you're not getting a look from me if you force me to create an account with you before I even get to see the program. You open the game and all you have is the option to log in or create an account. Ridiculous.

You should be able to go into the game, do a tutorial and play a sample sequence before committing to anything. I closed an uninstalled the app immediately."
911,Stinkboyollie,Sep 17 at 9:20 PM,4,Good,Teaches you how to box
912,Skn,Jul 27 at 2:34 AM,4,Well done,"Maybe an actual boxer or someone in better shape than me would find this easy, but i found this game physically challenging. One song had me shaking my arms out. The interface seems straightforward and simple, but it will tire out your arms. I also appreciated a non-subscription option"
913,YahsNicole Williams Wills Hudgeson,Aug 29 at 11:53 PM,5,I love it,I just started and I  feel and see a difference in my abs.
914,Jorge Diaz,Jul 5 at 11:38 PM,5,Awesome!!!,I downloaded the game having already downloaded other boxing games and this is by FAR the best workout game on my VR. i recommend this game to anyone that is looking to lose weight and stay fit. Awesonme game!!!!
915,iampandaexpress,Aug 5 at 9:43 PM,5,Fun App!,"This app is awesome. I like that i dont have to fully purchase the game to enjoy it forst, altho i will upgrade soon! Quite a workout, cant wait to finish this fitness journey!"
916,Daveybaby,Aug 3 at 11:34 PM,5,Fantastic work out,I try to do 20 mins a night on the free work out but I'm definitely considering buying the subscription for a bit more variety have already recommended to anyone I know ow with an oculus
917,Waqas Balkhi,Jul 12 at 12:07 AM,5,Awesome workout,"This is one of the best apps you can download to get that workout in. There are numerous free sessions with trainers who get you moving to the perfect songs. Whether you're a beginner or at an advanced workout stage, there is something for everyone! Very intuitive and easy to get into it! Would definitely recommend!!!"
918,Carlos,Jul 11 at 11:53 PM,5,this games AMAZING,I started playing this game as a recomemdation of my friend who said it will incourage me to go more workouts and he was spot on i started playing and I loved it straight away so i recommend if you want to workout but you dont have the energy play this and you will get the inspiration back i bet you
919,daisydragon,Aug 15 at 2:12 AM,5,Great !,My son absolutely loves this app.  At first he wasn’t so sure because he’s never boxed.  But have it a second try and love it!
920,Skyye,Jul 11 at 11:38 PM,5,Awesome Workout,Im 65 and wanting to get in shape. i love boxing and over the years have tried many but this one is the one that will have you staying on track. The music is good the trainers are awesome.  Its fun and will help get out your stress. You will want every punch to be better than the one before amd every session to be better than the last. This will give you the power and strength youre looking for no matter your age. Its for everyone so punch your way to good health like I am doing.
921,Maxwilko,Aug 28 at 11:54 AM,5,Best work out,This is actually so fun to do and it got me sweating in minutes
922,Micah,Sep 14 at 6:57 AM,1,Hi,It's not actually free for the whole thing
923,Zeph,Jul 23 at 3:07 AM,4,A replacement for MaiMai?,"I love playing arcade games like MaiMai and Wacca, and this game weirdly enough scratched that itch for me. The round circle you hit the edges of to play along to a song was... very fun. While I don't want to do the full version, the free version is great and gives me a way to play without having to do the full paid version. I approve, I just wish the paid version was a bit cheaper. I'd love to also be able to have custom songs. Maybe without the trainer too."
924,George,Aug 25 at 2:24 PM,5,Great !,The game does give you a really good workout along with also having fun!
925,Stevenpringle,Aug 21 at 10:55 PM,5,Good free version.,The free version is good- gives a good workout without feeling that it is a cutdown version.
926,SolutionsLady,Jul 10 at 11:01 PM,5,Lot's of Fun,"I've always thought I was a good fighter and absolutely love Boxing games. This game stands out because its hardly ever a focus on accuracy on other apps. Liteboxer made me realize how important accuracy and timing is as I am enjoying beating my personal score and competing with my brother and nephew. This game allows for loads of fun independently too. The music is alright, I just have the free version but I listen to all types of music so I am good with what they have to offer. I most likely will want to upgrade once I've ran through all the options but there is so many of choices I don't think that will be happening too soon. Its a great game."
927,Imhotp,Jul 5 at 11:27 PM,5,Real workout!!,"One of the best workout apps available, included it in my daily workout routine from the first day i installed it. I recommend it to anyone who's looking for a serious workout app to use on a daily basis."
928,NS,Aug 13 at 7:28 PM,5,Liteboxer,I like that they give you a free and don't force you to buy their product and you still get a good workout from the free version
929,Kramer,Aug 3 at 3:31 PM,5,Amazing,"I first thought I would never switch to the paid version. I am so happy I did, amazing cardio, great trainers. It allows me to spend less time at the gym and burn more calories."
930,PhunxZero,Jul 12 at 4:09 PM,5,Great for Quick Workouts,"So i started using this app just to see how it compared to my kickboxing class that I attended. Honestly its good, really good, it does teach you timing, rhythm and pace, you just  have to put in the footwork, if you are looking for a good calorie warmup or cooldown this app is a must!"
931,Titanbreez,Aug 17 at 9:29 PM,5,5stars,Intense and fast paced workout!  Begins slow and pace builds up very quick for a great training session.
932,Carter,Aug 15 at 1:09 AM,5,The game is good,I’ve been playing for about a week now and it’s just like the real thing it’s the best workout app out there now
933,Mellow,Jul 21 at 3:06 AM,4,Quality workouts,"liteboxer is one of the most approachable workout applications on VR, the options while on a free subscription don’t feel like theyve been inherently shortened just to push the paid version, while the paid version provides more customisation options to really fine tune the workout to a solid selection of music and modes, nice one guys :)"
934,Among,Sep 1 at 1:12 AM,5,Great game,One of my favorite workout games
935,Ericgnome,Aug 4 at 9:14 PM,4,A fun boxing sim,"Enjoyable and gives a good workout. Have played it a few days on Free Basic, and finding it fun. If one off payment was availab
le I would be more likely to jump at the advanced version, will have a think about subscription."
936,Arleth Saldana,Aug 27 at 9:17 PM,5,Fun,this app gets you working hard and it's fun to use
937,Specter,Aug 26 at 9:26 PM,5,very good.,absolutely amazing app for working out. i love it 10/10
938,Hitch hiker,Aug 21 at 9:18 PM,4,Good fun,Great game gets blood boiling and arms aching can only assume that means its working 100% worth downloading and doin few times a week
939,MrBustion,Jul 7 at 10:07 PM,5,Simply amazing,I find myself losing track of time while playing. It is fun and interactive. And the best part they have a free version. But the option to upgrade for more songs and better workouts. It’s for all fitness levels. From someone just starting on their weight loss/strength training journey. To someone that works out daily. Highly highly recommend.
940,Hakaishin626,Aug 22 at 2:38 AM,5,Actually Good,Started using this yesterday and it actually left me sore I like it lol
941,Victoria,"May 17, 2022 at 3:18 AM",4,The right amount of intensity.,"I am not a boxer; however, I do like that here is a hidden timer when striking base. The music in the background is awesome and not that heavy mental stuff all the time.     I also love the go at your own pace in the app. Some boxing apps try to move you quickly to the next level when you are not ready. And the combination of striking, I love that!"
942,Tee,Aug 24 at 2:59 AM,5,Fun,This app is a game changer! Very fun & definitely as workout
943,OrangeJuice,Aug 28 at 12:35 AM,5,best game,"i practiced punching here, its good 👍"
944,Arlecos,"May 8, 2022 at 1:00 AM",5,Colour me impressed (Free),"I was put off with the paywall on release and was disappointed in something that certainly looked good.. but I wasn't going to sign up just for a see.  
Aaaand then the limited free access popped and I had another go.  

I was not disappointed.
The content is captivating enough to get you to competing with your self toward actual replays.  Engagement is intuitive and simple... you're air boxing; it's not fine art.  It's a workout.  Timing, reaction and aim is the order of the day.  
The coaching is well recorded and enthusiastically delivered; guides are tractable, music is.. music and the game play loop works.  
Good time and effort went into this and it shows.
There are various modes of play to suit and stats and leaderboards keep you feeling suitably inadequate.

All this I feel is application and a game around something more interesting.. don't get me wrong, it's still a fun and an excellent application;  but what I am really intruigued by is the leap in VR tech that they used in building this app.
The fluid and simple interface that is polished and dripping tech that should have been native to VR from the word go.
It's honestly the best free hand tracking interaction that I've stumbled across and it seriously makes you wonder why we have to bother with the wagglesticks for a lot of generally straight forward apps (here's looking at you main-oculus-core-UI) ... 

LB is fun, I'll certainly be adding daily boxing to the programme... but this.. this - to my experience at least - is a quiet show case for some really good tech that I hope becomes part of standard core for VR interaction."
945,Swoo,Jul 7 at 9:09 PM,5,Great VR Fitness app!,"I was skeptical at first because I wondered how good can this be compared to the real thing, but I was surprised when I tried it and it is great! They have multiple modes but my favorite is where you punch to the beat of a song. Overall it’s a great fitness app and I recommend to everyone!"
946,Nicholas Moore,Jul 22 at 8:54 PM,2,Unpolished?,"I installed this app and went in as a basic user, I did one work out which I really enjoyed especially as it felt like a personal one to session with a trainer. 

After my first session I was prompted with a ""get premium* screen which I couldn't get rid of, I had to quit the app, I reloaded the app and logged back on navigating the menus nothing loaded. 

I quit the app tested my internet connection and everything was fine loaded again still nothing in the menus the brief time I had I did enjoy, I would have liked a couple more session then probably would go premium. 

I'll test again later, to make sure it's not me, has potential but on my headset it didn't work after the first workout, is this because I only do one work out then need premium? I'm not sure."
947,Justin,Sep 5 at 9:10 PM,4,Defunct workout,Fun workout. Just wish it was subscription based.
948,Mike,Jul 5 at 9:32 PM,5,Like Beat Saber with your fists,"I’m about a week in but really enjoying this app. I bought the Quest 2 for Beat Saber and a bit of a gamified workout and was simply looking at other options. I’ve tried FitXR, SuperNatural and a few others. Those are great trainer lead options. Sometimes though I just want to focus on the music and have some fun, Liteboxer fills that gap. The trainer lead segments are fun, but I personally like being able to pop on my headset and hit something to the music. 

I would recommend this app to anyone looking for fun fitness. The sub seems worth it given the music catalog and various access. I can’t tell you how to spend your money but I will say give the trial a try and you should be able to easily decide for yourself."
949,Uxk reaper,Aug 4 at 2:28 AM,5,Amazing Game,Liteboxer is such a fun game for me to just play for hours and it s even better because it is free.I just wish there was more choices for the free version.
950,Jocopel,Aug 6 at 9:14 PM,5,Yeah it made me sweat!!!,This game became a fast favorite....with great music and trainers!! I ve been using the free version so far and it has everything you need!!
951,Enzocreed25,Jul 16 at 9:29 PM,4,Really fun!,"So I've been using this for 2 days now.  The new free membership is fantastic, there's plenty of free content here with different types of gameplay styles, from the normal guitar hero-esque gameplay where you hit the targets to the beat of various songs with several genres from rock to hip hop or synth, or for someone who wants a more focused experience you can follow commands from a trainer holding pads.  As someone who has done boxing training before, initially it feels strange, but it goes you in quite quickly with a satisfying leaderboard and personal daily/ weekly targets at the end of each song/workout.  As a free app with a premium membership which offers more songs/ workout sessions, this is incredible value.  The premium version costs £15 a month but comes with a 7 day free trial.  I haven't done the trial yet as there is now so much free content to sink your teeth into.  Honestly give this a try if you're into something to add to your gym repertoire, as a way to spice up cardio training."
952,JenB,Jul 4 at 10:49 PM,5,Favorite workout game!,"I just love this “game”. I love the music in the premium package. I sweat like a pig and I love it! I have never enjoyed exercising…until now. I look forward to more content, but trust me, there is plenty of content already available. Plus you can play for free if you’re not ready to commit to a subscription. 2 thumbs up!"
953,Sammy,Aug 25 at 9:59 PM,5,Great Game!!!,Game is great for exercise. Fun To Play
954,Orianna,Aug 22 at 6:29 PM,4,Liteboxer,I have  good exercise with it.  But it seems a little high for my height. I've notice I need to reach a bit.
955,Flyingnoodle931,Aug 4 at 6:20 PM,5,great free workout,i havent played it much but its a great game easy to use fun to play with friends absolutely love it so i do recommend downloading this game
956,Raiferzz,Jul 7 at 10:45 PM,5,Pretty good workout!,"I've only had it for a couple of days and I'm already enjoying the variety of workouts that are available. It's not just about throwing punches, but also honing techniques and interlacing defensive movements like ducking and weaving. Can't wait to unpack the rest of the features!"
957,Caroph658,Aug 19 at 4:41 PM,5,Love it !,"Easy to use, a good way to work your arms, shoulder and back ! :)"
958,OmenMC,Jul 30 at 9:54 PM,5,Amazing,"Absolutely amazing for people that want to get  a decent cardio workout. Not only did I burn a lot of calories in a short period of time, I had fun while doing it!"

Highly recommend"
962,Dropitlowtothefloor,Aug 27 at 10:58 PM,5,it is awesome,i love the game....
963,Priscilla,"May 17, 2022 at 8:29 AM",5,Love it,"I love that you can freestyle or you can do the punch tracks. They have a lot of different songs you can punch too and different settings. You can do easy, medium, hard and expert. There’s so much to this app and it’s a great workout! Love it!"
964,Austin,Jul 15 at 9:05 PM,4,the free version is what you pay for.,"the free version has a very small selection of music. the workout is intense if you set it up to be. sometimes the punches dont register and your hand will go through the target, but besides those small things the game is definitely along the lines of beat saber for the workout you receive."
965,It3MelinaVR,Aug 17 at 7:28 AM,5,,Great game for working out if you’re not comfortable going to the gym!
966,QuietRain24,Aug 5 at 9:33 PM,5,A Fun Way To Work Out!,Liteboxer is a fun way to lose weight and train your reflexes using the beat of free music. I cant recommend this game enough!
967,Sdivinelove,Aug 4 at 10:15 AM,4,Better than expected.,"When I first downloaded the app I thought it was going to be a game, since it was the free version. After trying it out and starting to get the hang of it, it was a surprisingly decent workout."
968,Kudrei,Jul 24 at 11:04 PM,4,Good app,I like the fact that it has a free sub option. I have seen some of the other fitness apps and immediately removed them once I saw that you had to have a sub before even trying it out. The workouts are good and can really keep you on your toes.
969,ThatboiKai,Jul 4 at 12:28 AM,5,Gray indoor workout,Since my daughter works overnights and I have my grandson my gym time has cut down. It was actually my 8 year old grandson who got me started since he’s always on his oculus. This app totally makes up for my loss gym time. I’ve even got my oldest daughter to join in on getting active.
970,Nil,Jul 30 at 9:12 PM,5,Nil’s New entertainment🥰,"I love this app. I enjoy working out , I have fun with it and it’s amazing keeps me going I don’t have to go out find a place to do it .  Thanks 😍."
971,熊貓泡芙雲,"May 17, 2022 at 1:43 AM",4,Glad I gave it a try,"Despite the bad reviews I downloaded this, I think this is a great game. In my opinion, all the reviews about the subscription being too much are silly and yes it is a bit expensive but it is way worth it with the great selection of songs you can pick from!
I do think it would be great if they would make a chance of scenery as the you are just on one room the entire time."
972,wonaki,Aug 2 at 6:54 PM,5,Great App,Extremely helpful and genuinely fun courses. I started using this a couple days ago and I think it will seriously be a part of my workout.
973,Gavin,Aug 9 at 9:20 PM,5,such fun!,my kids and husband pkay this all the time! it is a fun game and gives you a workout while having fun!!
974,TrulyBiconic,Aug 3 at 2:10 PM,5,Great even for beginners!,This is the first game I played in VR And it is so good. I get a great workout and i feel fully immersed. I enjoy every second of it.
975,Debs,"May 7, 2022 at 12:54 AM",5,This senor loves it,"I am a senior, not quite 70 :)
First time  to use Liteboxer today I wanted to get off the couch but was worried it was for only young people in shape. I was impressed with the instructions and how easy it was to follow.. It’s for all ages, thank you!"
976,Ismael,Sep 9 at 1:57 AM,4,Fun workout,Fun to do
977,Ritz,Aug 11 at 3:44 AM,4,pretty cool & fun,"my 8 year old gets really into this game a lot and being a bit on the heavier side, it keeps her active. i feel like there could be more workouts to try."
978,Alirez,Aug 19 at 6:08 AM,5,Great for beginners!,"Easy to use and gives a good workout, even for seniors."
979,Joel garcia,Aug 22 at 6:09 AM,5,,It is really fun and would recommend it
980,May may,Jul 15 at 10:21 PM,5,Sooo Goood!,"Ok, if you haven’t tried this, YOU HAVE TO! The experience is amazing, totally worth it. You do not feel like you are working out but you realize it once done due to the sweat LOL. Do not be shy and try it at least once."
981,Shannon H,Aug 25 at 10:03 PM,4,Not bad,"Loved the music on the premium side, the free side is enough of a workout"
982,Ronnie,Aug 4 at 11:20 PM,5,PHENOMENAL,"First time usong this, I love the game/app, if you want to get a quick workout in, this is thw best option innmy opinion"
983,Pandora,Aug 1 at 2:43 PM,3,App not loading,I really.like this app. I went and upgraded to premium membership a d now the app won't load. I know it's not my WiFi because everything else works except for this app. Please help. My 7 day trail is ending in 4 days
984,Trey,Aug 24 at 5:13 AM,5,Pretty fun,A fun rhythm boxing game
985,Lezidragon,Aug 16 at 9:09 PM,5,Nice workouts on basic plan,You get a good variety of workouts on the free basic plan.
986,Jaysteer,Jul 26 at 9:59 PM,5,This app rocks,This app is good pace not to fast over the top. got a good free app and can pay if u want more out of it. tech u to how to play if need to learn before u play it.
987,Cam,Aug 5 at 1:57 AM,5,fun and challenging,"This is a real workout…great beats and amazing graphics! You will have  alot of fun , while you sweat . Love it!"
988,Santiago,Jul 14 at 9:15 PM,3,"Not good, not bad.","There are some things I liked.  I liked to try the boxing exercise without investing in equipment, the instructors are cool and the music is good.  I didn't like the tech, though.  The hands tracking function doesn't work well and to use the controllers is not comfortable.  Bare bones interface and probably it could use a better design than just replicate the physical machine.  So, pricing is the problem with this product.  Too expensive for not much of a subscription.  Way better options at better prices."
989,Helen,Aug 21 at 9:24 PM,5,Simple and fun,Easy to use. Simple and fun.
990,Ish,Jul 4 at 2:43 AM,5,A great choice for beginners.,"I'm very new to VR, but I found this game to be very entertaining. It's also great seated or standing. I'm very sedentary and am finding it to be a really good way to get some exercise and movement in. The music choices are both entertaining and great for setting the mood."
991,Moni,Aug 4 at 10:01 PM,5,Worth the price!,"If you are anti-gym and embarrassed to work out in front of others, this is worth the price and worth the time!"
992,Shrestha,Aug 18 at 9:04 PM,5,Awesome VR App,Great Intro app for new to VR individual.
993,Isiah,Jul 16 at 8:13 AM,5,Better than most,"I’m not gonna lie, I thought lite boxer was going to be one of those workout apps that give you 10secs to test it out than charge you but it’s not. I highly recommend if you wanna break a very big sweat."
994,z0mbie_drone,Aug 7 at 6:34 AM,5,Free workout,"Good free work out you can do at home.
I have only done a few sessions but I’ll be doing more"
995,Tanner,Aug 12 at 9:05 AM,4,I liked it,The songs in the free mode are ok and left my arms hurting the next day. If your looking for a good workout I highly recommend.
996,Clorissa,Aug 27 at 2:27 AM,4,I feel I'm in love,Not only am u working out.. im learning more moves.
997,HahleeS,Aug 2 at 9:17 PM,5,Great Stress Reliever,"Absolutely love this game.  I’m not much into pkaying VR, but this is a must! Especially after a stressful day."
998,Loganq,Aug 19 at 1:05 AM,4,,Pretty cool game it’s very nice it’s a workout game so u can play games as u workout
999,Fahrenheit,Aug 15 at 9:27 PM,4,wonderful workout,"great for working out, built up serious sweat and also helps with endurance and stamina. Great overall"
1000,Trenton Quick,Jul 23 at 9:42 PM,5,I love it,I was thinking that the game would lag but it didn't let's us try before buying and has awesome selections of training and songs to choose and freestyle boxing
1001,Jacob,Aug 3 at 12:08 AM,5,It's free,"That's the first time I saw a fitness app on vr that's free and for real it's perfect in every way !! 
10/10"
1002,Marvin Bell,Aug 5 at 3:20 PM,5,Fun Workout,This is the best VR workout available.   Really fun workout but gets you sweating in no time.
1003,Frank,Jul 21 at 2:08 AM,4,Not bad!,"I like the fact that is has a FREE subscription in opposition to most other fitness offerings on Oculus, or “Meta”.

Its a good solod setup.  Energetic coaches, the free music isn’t bad, I could go on.

I would recommend it."
1004,John,Aug 13 at 2:04 AM,5,Well worth it,I love this it's a nice workout would recommend to others
1005,Nick,Jul 28 at 9:19 PM,5,Fun and addicting,"I downloaded this to try and get active, after my first session I was hooked. Starting to two a days now just because it is so much"
1006,Theyluvme,Aug 14 at 9:07 PM,5,amazing for exercising 😆,amazing if you like the gym a gym at home 🤣
1007,Justin,Jul 6 at 12:38 AM,4,Gets the blood moving!!!,Keeps you on your toes! I like the different songs and the way the beat plays with the combinations that it gives you; very very fun. Looking forward to spending time on the LiteBoxer!
1008,Offroadn,Aug 10 at 9:31 PM,4,Easy to Use,This is a nice and easy app to use. I haven't played a lot with VR yet but this has me intrigued. I go and use this daily.
1009,J,Aug 14 at 9:28 PM,4,Fun and engaging,"This VR boxing is fun, easy to learn with a nice variety of options and akill levels and full workouts"
1010,Smokeufools,Jul 5 at 10:53 PM,4,Not a bad little fitness app,"So I have had a subscription with supernatural and own Body Combat, as well as owning Thrill of the Fight. I tried all modes in this. 

Positives

-Option to try with no obligation!

-Punch Tracks seem to be good for workout.

-Variety of different modes

Not so positives 

-no real detection for ducking and just in general boxing movement

- training session seems a little out of touch as trying to look at targets and trainer seems overwhelming

Things with potential

-Mitts mode seems like a quality workout

-capitalizing on the strengths of punch tracks and making playlists for those

Comparisons with the other games I have experienced:

I am an avid Body Combat user and now a Les Mills + Subscriber. With this being said I still feel like currently for me it gives me the best vr workout, and is very polished for what it is. 

Supernatural for me is more of a rhythm game than fitness app, and as polished as it is and I love the soundtrack, I felt like I didn’t get as much out of it fitness wise.

Liteboxer feels like some polish and expanding on its strengths could bring it to the forefront of the other fitness apps that are being offered. The fact there is a try before subscribing option makes this more appealing to most, and I think it makes sense to give all these a try and see what fits you the best."
1011,Braxton,Aug 3 at 6:15 AM,5,Great workout!,I'm not much of a gym goer so this is perfect for me! Gives me the energy I need. Great music as well!
1012,Dingusgamer1,Aug 2 at 10:30 PM,5,fun,this game is very fun and i would definitely reccomend it to any1 looking for a good sweaty experience
1013,MasterPayne911,Jul 25 at 4:50 AM,4,Pretty good,"It got me up and going, it took a second to get the rhythm but once it got it, it was fun I definitely recommend trying it, I do with there was more to do with just the free part but it's a good app."
1014,Shaniece Hudson,Aug 21 at 10:03 PM,4,Great,Such a great work out.. and the music selection Is awesome.
1015,MisDandEAH,Jul 23 at 1:45 AM,4,New To Oculus,I am new to Oculus and enjoy the free demo games. I enjoy the boxing game but do wish you didn't have to set up an account and wish they gave a little more play time to experience what you would be purchasing.
1016,SillyMcNoah,Jul 14 at 9:05 PM,5,Son loves playing it,My 11 year old is the primary user. He plays boxing most of time he is on the VR. It is a quality app. I will have to try it soon. He reccommends for people or kids who like to burn calories.
1017,ghosteboy,Jul 20 at 1:25 PM,4,it’s great!,I especially like the fact they allow you to play around 10 or so songs and 2 workouts for free. Not sure if I’d be willing to pay for the membership currently though because their aren’t enough songs that I enjoy.
1018,Mikey,Jun 23 at 11:56 AM,5,Keeps you on your toes,Great game with great upbeat songs. I guess originally this was not living up to its expectations. But with updates this game has really became something great. Its hard to find something that keeps you focused throughout a workout and this is definitely it. Recommend it for anyone who definitely wants to start working out but hasn’t got a clue where to start.
1019,Ash,"May 30, 2022 at 4:55 AM",5,It keeps getting better!,"I have been using liteboxer vr now almost every weekend now to give my hands a rest from punching my actual liteboxer.  It’s a great way to work out and fun.

It also just keeps getting better, every app update brings new features and added polish.

I love how I can now pretty much take my boxing wherever I go too."
1020,Stingi210,"May 30, 2022 at 7:47 AM",5,Fun. Workout. Free.,"I opted for the free version since it's my first time using the app. Did not disappoint. I kept seeing the ad for the physical machine on YouTube and I really wanted to try it. The free version on VR is good for a nice workout. The music is mainstream upbeat Hip-hop and EDM. About 25-30 songs available, nothing that I really listen to as far as songs or artists but likeable selection. This app got me moving and I was sweating after 20 minutes. I am definitely thinking about the premium package simply for the variety of music that is offered. They do have a freestyle mode that you can enjoy with your own music on in the background. Very fun and entertaining."
1021,Pro124yt,Jul 21 at 9:04 PM,4,Great for a short workout,I played this game for about an hour and it felt like I was having a workout for my room and I had someone with me to help with it. I recommend this game to people who want a 10 minute workout from your head set.
1022,AmandaGlenn,Jul 9 at 4:19 AM,5,Love it,"I still feel like using the actual liteboxer machine is a better overall workout, but I love the oculus app for a more portable option. So many great punch tracks and engaging graphics while you workout. 100% recommend!"
1023,Seabee,Aug 2 at 11:14 PM,5,really good app,i love this it reminds me of beat saber. its a really good work out and makes exercising fun.
1024,Kayw,Jul 9 at 11:07 PM,5,Brilliant !,I have loved the free version so far that I am thinking about getting it on subscription. Love the trainer being right in front of you to cheer you on and encourage you. Great for all levels definitely recommend!
1025,Name,Jun 6 at 9:35 PM,5,Awesome workout!!! Must try now!!!,I just downloaded it the other day and man an I already hooked. The beginner workouts are perfect if you want to start off slow. There is plenty of variety for everyone from choice of music to choice of level from beginner to pro. I guarantee if you try it out you won't be disappointed!!! Love It!!!
1026,hanover7,Jul 10 at 10:24 PM,4,Fun and exciting,I have seen this app on social media and knew I wanted to try it! The free subscription is a fun way to introduce you to boxing. I loved playing it and am planning on purchasing the full subscription. It’s fun and is an exciting was time get some exercise in!
1027,Chris,Jul 24 at 2:14 AM,5,good app and FREE,really enjoyable app. ive only played the free version so far but that is very good. if i stick to it i may upgrade to the premium version
1028,Jbails44,Jul 11 at 8:55 PM,5,excellent!,liteboxer feels like actual boxing training compared to similar apps on the occulus. the coaches are are extraordinary and really push you to your limits! best boxing app on the occulus hands down.
1029,Donahue,Jul 4 at 2:11 AM,5,Super Fun!!,"This app has become one of my all time favorites to use! Not only is it just super fun to play, but its a great workout. After the first few times, your arms will feel the burn. The training courses are a must try and super beneficial!!"
1030,OZLbarny,Aug 2 at 9:14 PM,5,Great workout,Songs are amazing and nice to vibe to i realy recommend for a good workout session!!
1031,Mars,Jul 2 at 5:43 AM,4,Give it a try it is genuinely fun,I saw an add for this game so I decided to try it out I read many other reviews and they were supportive of this game I really enjoyed it I am not a pro at this but if I play this longer I will definitely see improvement. There is only one thing that ruined my gameplay and it was that when I hit one of the circles it sometimes didnt work. But besides that one thing this game is very fun and it gets addicting trying to beat other peoples score!
1032,Haggis,Aug 15 at 1:41 AM,5,Good workout,fun and a good workout
1033,Tasha,Jul 8 at 1:31 AM,5,Great workout,I don't have time for the gym and this is a great workout that I can do from my bedroom whenever I have time. I love that u can do a couple minutes at a time then take a break or u can do full workout in one shot
1034,ainsley,Jul 20 at 9:15 PM,5,great workout great fun,absolutely great app for light workouts that get you sweating. highly recommend using the subscription service you get more than your monies worth
1035,SheMomBa,Jun 1 at 9:12 PM,5,Love it,I love this game. I just tried it with my husband and it really gives you that burn your looking for. Its honestly better then having to go to a gym. Plus the music is really cool. You can also make your own beat. I tried it haha and it made me want to keep making beats.
1036,Frankmore05,Jul 31 at 9:03 PM,5,Great app,I would totally recommend this app to anyone looking to have a fun workout and lose weight
1037,OUTWARD,Jun 24 at 3:46 PM,5,Great app,"The game could use more free lessons and basic workouts, but overall the game is really fun can used in a routine very easily and we'll rounded over all, I'd recommend this game to anyone, since it's free to play and I would especially to those who would want break a sweat."
1038,Melodie,Jul 13 at 7:56 PM,3,good app but trial was misleading,"I've loved the workouts so far, honestly one of my favorite workout apps!
That being said it claimed a 30 day free trial. - throughout the signup it switched to two weeks and then I was charged after one week.
Not interested in keeping my subscription anymore."
1039,TheFrench5,Jul 19 at 9:26 PM,5,Great exercise!,My son and I love the app! It’s a great way to get ur cardio up. It’s also helped my 12 year old learn to box some too. It’s been a great app!
1040,ImSuperBean,Jul 1 at 1:36 AM,4,Not bad but could be improved,"For a free download it’s not bad, they give you limited access to training and songs, but constantly push the membership which at $18/mo and is kinda expensive for just an app. I would say get it for the free side but maybe wait till the monthly price comes down to maybe $9.99/mo to where it’s more in line with a gym membership. But over all it’s a decent app just needs to work on pricing."
1041,Tron,Jul 1 at 2:56 AM,4,Great workout and fun,"I always wanted to have one of those boxing machines but they’re too expensive. This is a great alternative and it’s a lot of fun. I like the personal trainers who work with the mitts. I like the free option but will likely purchase a subscription soon. If you want a good workout, definitely check this app out."
1042,Cristie,Jul 12 at 7:28 AM,5,A fun way to get moving,"This is a super easy, super fun way to be active. I like that there are customizable goals and if I wanted to match with other players to help push myself, its an option. 10/10 recommend."
1043,Draco68,Jul 30 at 11:41 AM,5,,I just started using lite boxer. I got the premium. I like how it's got different modes and music
1044,Sonoflightgaming,Aug 4 at 4:35 PM,4,basic workouts help,i like the basic workouts but theres really no guide to them its just straight into the session with lots of room to mess up
1045,Kborn,Jun 4 at 9:31 AM,5,Liteboxer from Kerry Briggs,Being that I'm new to the whole Oculus experience. This fitness program is totally awesome and when I say awesome I mean fit awesome I tried one of the 10 minute sessions and being 56 years old it gave me extreme and sharp totally quick workout within that 10 minute time. That is by far one of the best I've ever had in my life experience I've never had nothing else that broke me out into a good sweat and I mean good sweat like that outside of actually doing some physical hard labor on my job so that goes to say. So anybody with the Oculus VR or the quest 2 headset I would encourage you go get it lite boxer liteboxer liteboxer.
1046,Nomad,Jul 2 at 3:06 AM,5,impressive,I've never used a app like this one and the ease of control and the ease from which the trainers are very easy to listen to and the instructions are so simple my 6 year old grandson could follow them.  All in all its a really good app.
1047,sphinx12390,Jul 26 at 5:36 PM,2,I can’t use it,It was great when I first used it but when I tried using it the next day I couldn’t get any basic features and I was only able to use the freelance work out. Plz makers of this app plz fix it
1048,Harry,Jul 29 at 12:03 AM,5,Amazing,Amazing workouts really helps build combos and helpful tool for when I am not training at the gym.
1049,Straightgooffin,"May 18, 2022 at 4:24 PM",4,Straightgooffin - 4 star review,This game definitely gives you a work out. You will feel the burn; which I enjoy. Would be nice if you could hear a preview of the tracks before you start the song. I already recommended this game to other on social media @virtulescapes.pro
1050,Jashiwa,Jul 5 at 4:11 AM,2,You won’t learn any skills with this.,"I’ve trained boxing and this came up as an ad on social media so I thought I would give it a try.  I tried what was available in basic (what I could play without paying).  You basically speed flail to tap the board to attain high score.  I started off in traditional boxing stance and tried to play it using proper punching technique and it was more beneficial to stand straight in front of the in game target board with my fists to my chest speed flailing out to tap the board accordingly.  The most you can learn from this is awkward hand/eye coordination.  If you are looking for a boxing workout, thrill of the fight is much better than this, it just doesn’t have the exciting music and flashy lights.  I spent 20 minutes straight playing this and didn’t break a sweat, one fight on easy in TOTF (three, 2 minute rounds) had me sweaty and tired."
1051,Tim,Jul 19 at 10:33 PM,4,Very Fun way to stay in shape,"I tried this for the first time yesterday.  Fun way to stay active, while also playing a game.  Looking forward to increasing the difficulty settings the more I use the game.  highly suggest using it"
1052,Vinny,Aug 3 at 9:06 PM,5,Great light workout,Good ways to keep your body when you are too lazy to go to the gym
1053,Omentiarus,Aug 4 at 9:09 PM,5,Fantastic,What a brilliant way to work up a sweat and shed those pounds
1054,Amy,Jul 30 at 11:49 PM,4,Enjoyable,"I have enjoyed playing Liteboxer, so far!! I would enjoy it more of the workouts were a little more challenging and the visuals more detailed."
1055,Harie_Carie,Jul 29 at 9:53 PM,5,It’s fun,It’s fun hope they add more songs soon and I’m definitely making this my exercise now
1056,Lucinda Law,Jul 21 at 9:54 PM,5,66 year old Grandmother,I am a 66 year old Grandmother and I love this app. It's challenging and fun. I can finally exercise without it killing my knees.
1057,Jaeden Drew Wagers,Aug 12 at 8:42 PM,5,,It's a pretty good
1058,Ha'ron King,"May 17, 2022 at 9:20 AM",3,"Good workouts, no hands.","I actually love LiteboxerVR. Im 38 and have been working out to the punch tracks and all the classes for a few months now. This was one of the first apps i downloaded once i purchased my Q2. Music is great, the trainers are awesome, my only problem is tracking for hands and controllers are slightly off. I would land a direct punch but sometimes my hand disappears completely. other than that i enjoy it."
1059,Tasha,Jul 5 at 9:58 PM,4,Gets me pumped,So this is really my first time ever working out. And even using VR and makes it fun for me. The trainers high energy positive attitude really motivates me to keep it up keep up the energy. So if you never worked out never boxed want to try something different this would be it
1060,Danny,Jul 28 at 5:59 PM,4,It great,Not giving it a 5 star since all the good songs are behind a pay wall.but it is a good workout for those who lack stamina and dont know how to box.
1061,Nicole,Jul 12 at 1:10 AM,5,A fun way to workout,I was starting to get bored of my workouts and now I look forword to playing/working out. The music is great and I can’t wait to see what other artists they add to the mix!
1062,Hazza,Aug 3 at 9:13 PM,5,Great,Excellent game good workout I love it good for all family
1063,CaptainRum,Jun 5 at 9:09 PM,5,Excellent workout!,I absolutely love this app. Just started using Oculus and wanted do to something with fitness.  Boy does this give you a workout.  I am using the basic and there are a lot of workouts and music to use. Very accurate and real! This is now part of my workout routine! Thank you!
1064,Strix,Jun 15 at 9:49 PM,5,My arms are jello but I can't stop!,I downloaded every "free" boxing app on the oculus store and pretty much all of them have a ~$35 subscription requirement to even get into the menus. This one has tons of free workouts and songs. Once I improve form a bit using the free stuff I'll happily sign up for the sub. I'm excited to try the hand tracking because I keep smashing the controller against the front of the headset.
1065,Nicolas The Worst,Jun 15 at 9:49 PM,5,Stationary!,"i really like the stationary aspect of this game. not worrying about accidentally hitting something is great. i really like that they have a free option now. i was surprised with the free account because i was expecting only 2 or 3 songs to work with but they provide more about 30. way more than i thought i was gonna get with the free option.
work up a good sweat with it as well!"
1066,Bailey,Jul 20 at 5:45 AM,5,best oculus game out there,this game is so fun and their subscrtiption os so affordable. they have so many songs to choose from. great for weight loss☺️
1067,Norberto,Aug 9 at 10:35 PM,5,Fun,amazing so glad its free
1068,riot4813,Jun 16 at 9:47 PM,5,Great Workout App,The rating made me hesitant to download this App. I'm so glad I did. It is very easy and quick to use. I feel myself wanting to go back to my VR to play this over and over throughout the day and I sweat quite a bit at times using it. There's a great song list. I wonder how often it's updated?
1069,arianak,Nov 11 at 3:20 AM,5,,it is a great app for ￼ training and ￼ exercising
1070,Tygrshark,"May 28, 2022 at 4:19 AM",4,A Great Way to Exercise Without The Gym,"Liteboxer is an exceptional game, in that its small snippets of cardio are great for beginners, yet allows you to build upon these short sessions to longer more challenging programs. There is the option to subscribe monthly and reap benefits, but even without a subscription Liteboxer is an excellent cardio exercise. Especially for those who hate to exercise. I have used Liteboxer for several weeks and have thoroughly enjoyed the outcome so far. Definitely worth downloading and give it a try."
1071,TheNoahShowah,Jun 1 at 9:34 PM,5,GREAT GAME,Its a great game if you would like toI get a good workout while listening to music or if you want to become a  good boxer. I downloaded and immediately loved it. The best part its FREEEEEEE. I recommend getting this game if you like a ggod workout
1072,Steggs,Aug 20 at 10:19 PM,4,Fun,Good fun good experience
1073,Shadow,Jun 15 at 12:54 AM,5,Honestly surprised this rose my pulse,I know liteboxer in the past was not as solid as I'd hoped it to. But after the overhaul it is a much better game going forward. Especially with the choices in membership which make it easier for people to try to game out before committing to a cardio intense knockout! This game is only going to get better overtime!
1074,RedDeadUnDead35,Jun 30 at 7:51 PM,3,The app is good. Not as fun as I thought,I only have the free version of the game. I dont know what the paid version is like. heres a few things I like about the game. I like the interface with the trianers. I like how the game gets you amped up for a good workout. I liked how after your done working out you can feel the burn. A couple things I didn’t like was the punching pad. i feel it could. have had a better design. I also think the game could be more submersive/interactive. I would like to see the enviorment be in a gym or boxing ring. i think if you were punching the trainer and he was blocking while you punched or maybe perticipated in a boxing practice other than just telling you commands it would be more fun. I give it a 5/10. Like I said iI dont have the paid version so it could be better. zi may have to watch youtube videos of the paid version to know if it would be worth paying for. As for right now its not a game I would purchase.
1075,Big Daddy,Jul 20 at 1:12 AM,5,Good,"This workout is very helpful and very fun, I have lost 15 poumds so far in just 30 days...i recommend this app for everyone"
1076,Coughodemon,Jun 25 at 9:33 PM,4,Its finally something many can play now,"So recently they have added a free membership option, you get some more basic songs and limited access to stuff. However you get everything you need for a good workout still, you might not be able to listen to your favorite song but they give you plenty of decent music for free. The gameplay is fun, I wish some of it was slightly different as its hard to see the little dots sometimes when your punching and sweating like crazy. My arms... oh my poor arms, after a few songs they were tired oh so incredibly tired. You get a very good workout with this app/game, and since the free update I do genuinely recommend it as an essential quest item."
1077,Bradsarge,Jun 26 at 7:12 AM,4,Decent boxing alternative,"Well built boxing fitness game with a variety of free workouts. Differs to the usual 'floating balloons travelling towards you' boxing rhythm games, but as a result requires greater coordination and careful listening of the instructor. Not sure I would pay for a full membership but appreciate the different approach."
1078,Marigiela,Aug 14 at 9:03 PM,4,Entertaining exercise,It’s a good app to kill time and get workout on
1079,RapzSquad,Jun 13 at 11:46 PM,5,Better than expected,"My expectations were not high because of all the negative reviews, however, I found it to be a good high energy challenge to add to my workout regime. I find it to be challenging and fast paced, which ultimately gets the heart rate up. Can be as quick or long as you want. For the basic free edition, I really like it!!"
1080,BJH,Jul 31 at 9:23 AM,5,it is very good,this game is very good if you want a good workout with some music
1081,Mari,Aug 10 at 10:03 PM,4,Great cardio app,This app is great for burning calories could be more free-friendly.
1082,Raph,Jul 5 at 9:06 PM,5,Great workout using passthrough,Loved the song choices. Got a great workout and loved that I was able to use pass-through. Felt like I could play for much longer than other games where it can sometimes feel disorienting.
1083,JIGGY_Victor,Jul 25 at 6:26 AM,5,Good Game to Burn some fat,This has helped me get active while playing from my living room. The game is very interactive
1084,Tee Sheps,Aug 9 at 5:30 AM,5,Great game,Great for casual
1085,JordTheNord,Aug 13 at 6:46 AM,4,Not bad,For a casual boxing excersize this will do the trick.
1086,Roy,Jun 12 at 2:21 PM,5,Brilliant,"Yeah, it’s got a premium subscription. Yeah, it’s a little pricey. It’s worth it, though, for any VR fitness fanatic. Great new content added everyday, world-class music and latest releases, too. The bad reviews are people salty at the fact that you have to pay to make the most of the game. But what’s worth it is worth it. No harm paying for something you can keep enjoying."
1087,LucaLucas,"Apr 29, 2022 at 2:19 AM",1,Trash,"Once you’ve installed the game, you aren’t able to play unless you pay for their monthly subscription, the cheapest of which is around $20 a month. That’s $240 a year. I suppose if this game were of the same quality as the one time payment games like Resident Evil 4 ($40), Beat Saber ($30), or I Expect You to Die ($24.99) then MAYBE their price tag would make sense. Telling by their trailer and reviews, however, they’re a far cry from any of the games I’ve mentioned here. Not to mention, that you don’t see these price tags until AFTER you’ve installed the game. It’s a garbage game with a garbage business model."
1088,Melissa,Jul 22 at 12:47 AM,5,Great Workout,I am just starting out with the VR & I really liked this app as a good workout that was easy to use.
1089,Andrew Contreras,Jun 1 at 9:04 PM,5,Fun way to sweat and great alternative,Lite boxer is a fun way to sweat because it has many songs to choose from and you punch on beat which is a game changer considering people would be bored with just punching without no beat.It also is a great way to pass some time.
1090,Lacy Renee Deshotel,Jun 21 at 6:13 PM,5,I CANT BELIEVE I JUST EXERCISED!,This app is amazing. First of all it's user friendly and well made. It is also so much fun.  I am very overweight and exercise isn't isn't easiest thing to do. However I did an hour of this without even realizing it because it was so engaging and so fun!
1091,Jackson,Jun 30 at 2:14 AM,5,The other day i woke up,I woke up and felt some soreness on my left side.   I kept trying to think what had I done. Then I remembered I did some boxing and i was excited. I was having fun and not really realiziing I was working out.
1092,KayzKreationz,Jun 23 at 12:29 AM,4,"Great Workout, would like more direction","I've just started using the Liteboxer app.  I love it so far.  I feel like it's a really good workout and will be even better as I use it more and get more familiar with all the different workouts/classes in it.  (I only have the basic account)  However, for someone that's not used to this kind of exercise, activity or app, I do feel like there should more direction an explanation on all the different types of workouts & classes.  Maybe I missed something, but I don't feel like there was as much explanation about how to use the app as there could have been, especially for beginners.  But I love it so far as I try each activity and figure it out."
1093,Jessa,Jun 22 at 5:06 PM,4,Love Boxing in VR,"I love this app and it's a great workout! I added 1.5lb weights to my wrists and it kills me after about 20 min. I have noticed that it doesn't always pick up my hits, but it's not too big of a deal because I am still learning the ropes. I do wish that the subscription was a little less, but I think it is an awesome alternative to the in-home version."
1094,Sunshinechell,Jul 22 at 11:35 PM,5,One of my favorite apps,It different routines and the music is great.  I like to use the free punches on rough days.
1095,TheBearGamer,Jul 30 at 9:40 AM,5,Good music and a good workout,This game is a good way to workout and jam to some tunes
1096,Bubbles,Jun 10 at 9:07 PM,5,Great Option For Home Workouts,"This app is great for those who can’t or just don’t have time to go to the gym or just want to have some guided fun while working out. It’s simple and easy to understand and you start to feel results after just one session, there is a paid membership, however the free option still gives you plenty to work with as far as exercise goes. Definitely recommend for any of those who are looking for an at home alternative for working out."
1097,Batdemon,Jun 25 at 10:28 PM,5,I'm exhausted,"These workouts are fun and have me panting and that's a good thing. The music is good which helps to push me through the workouts.

Now that I have the basics down I'm getting competitive which is good for my fitness journey."
1098,Unicorn,"May 17, 2022 at 5:25 AM",4,A fun way to work out,I love this app. It’s fun with some great music options. I enjoy getting a workout when I can’t get to the gym. My 11yr old and I like to try new songs on different levels and beat our scores.
1099,Sr.Pickletickle,Aug 20 at 9:16 PM,3,,It's a good light work out
1100,RooForPresident,Jul 7 at 4:33 AM,3,good for beginners,I downloded the free verison and thought it was alright. Fun at first but I found it a little repetitive. I have an 11 year martial arts background though so that could be why. This app could be great for someone with minimual or no experience though!
1101,Steve1976,Jul 17 at 10:18 PM,5,boxing work out 💪💪,absolutely love it its fun and work out to. really worked up a sweat and mkes exercise a more enjoyable experience
1102,Inky,Jul 30 at 9:11 PM,4,The free version is good to start with.,For me I'm finding it hard to follow but with practice I hope to improve. It's good to get the idea of it.
1103,Chubs,Jul 14 at 12:47 AM,4,Pretty good,"free version without Subscription is not half bad. 

Personally think the subscription price is a bit steep but well worth downloading just for the free version. Does make you get a sweat on"
1104,mvmyers126,Jul 8 at 10:04 PM,5,Fun and useful,This is a great way to get in a fun workout in a different way. The options they have keep things fresh and the free account level is nice to give it a try.
1105,Jason,Jun 9 at 9:15 PM,5,Fun Workout Experience,"I downloaded this app a couple months ago only to be bummed about there not being any free things to try. I didn't want to pay the monthly fee to try it. They updated the app about a month ago (spring 2022) to have some free stuff and it lets you get a good sense of what the app offers. The limited selection is not the most notable songs but it's free so there's that compromise. The tracking is pretty solid. The trainer sessions are a good way to learn what the app can do. 

It's not boxing, as there isn't the feedback that hitting a bag gives. I'm going to use this app as a rainy day workout. It does for sure supply a cardio bump, though, as noted, not quite like actual boxing."
1106,virtualpreacher1007,Jun 9 at 9:34 PM,5,Fun and Beneficial Boxing VR,"I’ve tried all of the current VR boxing programs. This one has found the perfect balance for me. Others feel too much like a video game and even though I get a good workout playing them, the video game aspect hurts the longevity of its use for me. However, LiteBoxer has found the balance of fun, yet afterwards I have the satisfied feeling of finishing a rigorous workout. I highly recommend this program."
1107,Samantha,Jun 9 at 11:38 PM,5,Best workout ever!,I’m not a big gym person. So exercising has always been difficult for me as it was never enjoyable. After trying and using liteboxer I have finally found my perfect workout. It makes me work hard and focus on being active while being enjoyable. I don’t think I could ever go back to traditional exercise.
1108,Ace,Jul 15 at 8:33 PM,5,Great App,"Great App, paying the monthly. I was hesitant at first but loving the app so far. The workout track selection is great!"
1109,emilyescobar,Jul 18 at 10:34 PM,5,Great for a quick workout session,The app offers a variety of options for what you need in a workout. It keeps you moving and entertained.
1110,MykaylaTayler,Jun 9 at 10:02 PM,5,Amazing experience,"my first few days I downloaded and subscribed to a countless amount of boxing and workout apps on the quest after me and my family tried all of them, Liteboxer was the only subcriptions we kept. The music, the immersiveness of the litebox itself, the trainers, this experince is everything I wanted."
1111,mike_0904,Jul 28 at 9:04 PM,5,🔥,It’s really good for burning calories and practicing
1112,BeatZ,Jun 27 at 10:54 PM,5,It’s a great game!!,"If you really want a work out or just want to have fun this is the game for you, it’s very fun and the music selections are great to chose from. Overall it’s a very great game and I recommend it to all!!!"
1113,Kai,Jul 9 at 11:19 AM,5,best game for fitness,"if your looking for a good game that will get you sweaty and veins showing, this is an amazing game! punch along to the beat and enjoy 10/10 its so good"

1115,RecklessxShot,Jun 6 at 12:57 AM,5,Great way to get a workout in!,My son and I both enjoy this game. I selected the free version and there is so many choices. It's harder then I thought it would be for the songs. Great way to teach my son proper punching skills.
1116,Miss Lady,Jul 9 at 9:12 PM,5,Great workout!,"I didnt ezpect to get such a good worlout from this app. Even on days it hurta to stand, i play sitting down. I love the freestyle section best."
1117,Dabean34,Jul 6 at 4:08 AM,5,Amazing,Love it the timing the intense work out if u could put ur own music it would be prefect
1118,Killa,Jun 20 at 6:26 AM,4,Great app,Intensive workouts. I actually like the routines that come free in this app. You can actually use the app and workout unlike other apps in which you have to add your financial info. The premium is a bit expensive but the free part seems to be working and is super fun therefore I might give the premium a try. I recommend this workout game.
1119,Mbk2joker,Jul 23 at 2:08 AM,5,So easy,i like more fast oaced options but its jice to pace myself sometimes i guess
1120,CodedParticles,Jun 8 at 8:53 AM,5,Nice workouts to your daily routine,"I recently decided to try it with their free basic subscription. I like enjoy it so far. The trainers help to get you pumped during sessions. I've enjoyed using in addintion to doing Les Mills BodyCombatVR, and running. Also good for quick burst of cardio between business calls. Definitely gets addictive."
1121,Mcintosh,Aug 1 at 9:03 PM,4,"Fun, wish more was in the free",Fun game. Wish there was a little more in the free version but my boys like it.
1122,theetink,Jun 27 at 10:13 PM,5,GREAT !!,"No need for a gym with this game. It feels sOO realistic and you get a great workout in. If you don’t want to pay for it , try the free version first. Both experiences are great & its very fun."
1123,poopbear,Jun 18 at 4:56 AM,4,I like it a lot,"New to VR and saw an ad for Liteboxer. Decided to try it out because it looked like fun and was a cool idea. Honestly after trying it out I really enjoyed the app and it did make me work up a sweat which I liked. I just wish we had access to like Spotify for the free play and customs songs and all that. But overall I like the app it’s fun probably going to try to use this for days I can’t hit the gym and I’ll stay on the free membership for now, prices are a little too steep for me."
1124,Sam,"Mar 5, 2022 at 3:54 AM",2,"Basic game, pricing model needs work","I may not be the intended audience for this, as I am looking for more boxing simulators like Thrill of the Fight. However, the game itself is extremely rudimentary and it feels like the paywall is just to cover the licensing cost attached to the song library (which I personally don't care about, I can listen to my own music)

If this were a free game or a one off cost I'd probably rate it slightly higher, however, all the fake new 5* reviews aside I think the developers should take this feedback on board and look at adjusting their pricing model before it's too late.

Just sell song 'packs' or class bundles on a pay as you to basis, the monthly pricing is a kick in the teeth for users considering a game like ToTF is like £7.99 one off..."
1125,Shaw,Jul 12 at 9:14 PM,4,Solid Light Workouts,Enjoying this so far. Quick and easy workouts. Gonna use it on the free version for a few weeks and look at subscribing if it's still got my interest later. So far so good!
1126,Zorbon,Jun 27 at 11:18 PM,5,Fantastic Game,I am just amazed how much fun this game is and how much of a work out it is . Loads of fun makes you keep wanting to play but when you are done you relize how much of a work out you had lol
1127,Yournightmare,Jul 19 at 6:40 AM,1,Can't say anything about the game,Try to give an update on this game and everytime I tried to play it freezes and won't let me do anything I have to reset everything and same problem
1128,Juan Sanchsz,Jul 17 at 12:19 AM,5,Good boxing game,"This game is good for boxing, very good graphics! Music choices are awesome! For working out."
1129,Tiger,Jul 7 at 9:06 PM,5,great workout,I love that this combines the fun of virtual reality with exercise!  It feels like you are literally working right in front of a trainer.
1130,LeeLee,Jul 14 at 10:29 PM,4,Enjoyed It,I have only tried the Basic Plan but will upgrade as soon as I get better at it. It’s nice that they offer you a chance to actually try it before you buy it.
1131,Amethyst,Jun 14 at 5:37 AM,5,Awesome fitness game,The game is very groovy has really good song options my only complaint is i wish you could preview the songs to listen if you're feeling that song or not the  only way to find out is if you choose to play that song but other than that the game is very fun.
1132,Kk,Jul 12 at 1:18 AM,4,Enjoyable experience!,"Both my daughter and I enjoyed this game. Good / fun work out. She did accidentally punch the window, it did not break thank God. Lol. Worth a try, enough good free content."
1133,Tmthysmmrs,Jul 10 at 9:26 PM,4,Fun,It was fun for the 10 minutes I played. More free songs would be nice but I guess you have to make your money too. I’d rather pay a flat rate than to have to subscribe though
1134,Tony,Jul 7 at 9:12 PM,5,Super Intense,"I’m like so much the game; for me, the intensity and speed are very challenging, and the rank is an extra motivation to keep going."
1135,Popeye,Jul 31 at 9:02 PM,5,Good for kids,Kids love it.
1136,Shawn,Jul 6 at 2:21 AM,5,fun little exercise,i picked it up for my daughter she said its a fun little exercise
1137,TheSc1entist,Jul 13 at 1:50 PM,4,Super fun,I have the FREE version & it is still has a lot of fun challenges/workouts that you can participate in. It is easy to pick up & definitely worth the download.
1138,Benttiz,Jul 25 at 1:25 AM,5,good workout,this is a good cardio workout and cal burnner
1139,Victor,Jul 17 at 11:13 PM,4,Great Alternative,"When you dont want to leave the house in this Texas heat. Definitely better then expected, its really good and it will make you sweat."
1140,Joel,Jul 18 at 9:06 PM,4,Great for getting some cardio,Great game for breaking a sweat.  My only issue is the lack of variety in the music catalog.  Most of the artists I don’t know
1141,Usernam.,Jun 3 at 6:31 AM,5,Exactly what it says it is,"Yeah, its a boxing trainer. I'm sure the subscription is very good but the free version is also quite useful. If you want to practice/train to box without leaving the house then this is a good route to go. Its got good music and the beats fit well with the gameplay. If you don't want to just listen to the music doing your own thing than you can practice with the free trainer. I've never taken boxing lessons before but it seems legit and very beginner friendly."
1142,AriesOxide,Jun 22 at 12:00 AM,5,great workout!,"i love to play rhythm games, so putting a workput like boxing to mysic is 10/10 in my book! i progressed quickly with the quickplay option. once i have bills taken care of i do plan on subscribing monthly!"
1143,Heather,Jun 2 at 5:28 PM,5,Part of my top 5 apps!,Liteboxer makes it easy to get a quick boxing session in even on busy days. The music is fun and the trainers are helpful for mitt drills and workouts. I like that I am able to take what I learn and replicate patterns on an actual punching bag when the Oculus is being used by my kids or charging. Definitely one of my top 5 fave apps for fun and fitness.
1144,Dave,Jun 25 at 6:31 PM,5,Great workout,I have been using the free trial and I definitely plan on renewing the subscription. Great workouts great soundtrack very easy to get lost in the music and end up working out for hours!
1145,Genhere,Jun 9 at 9:23 PM,5,Not Generic love it for real,I am going to get the monthly membership soon but I wanted to test it out first which I can do because there’s a free option there and it was good so now I’m about to upgrade to get my favorite songs let’s gooo!! Definitely worth trying I’m not even kidding
1146,Jason,Jun 2 at 3:48 PM,5,Plateau breaker!,"This boxing app is just what I needed! I have never boxed before, but the levels and instructions continue to help me improve my form and how I feel. I've struggles with losing weight, and this app gets me motivated and engaged enough that I was able to finally push past my weight plateau! I really enjoy doing the workouts, and will keep using the app to help me stay in shape."
1147,TheMasterMc,Jul 7 at 1:34 AM,2,30 day trial,"Was about to sign up since there is a 30 day trial for premium. However, when I went to sign up, it’s only seven days. I want to give this app a good monthly try since I already use Suoernatural and Les Mills."
1148,Bigman,Jun 16 at 1:14 AM,4,Pretty good but needs a little work,"While the app works mostly fine.  It does not synch with the Android version son my settings ,punch stats, and challenges did not come over the VR app. The main reason I got this app is so when I travel I don't have to skip my workout days.  But the VR app and Android app don't have the same information.  I did a VR workout on Sunday and the Android app had no record of it. Also you cannot do multiple songs punchtack workouts like on Android"
1149,Hyper,Jun 13 at 9:16 PM,4,Liteboxer Is Awesome!,"This game is 4 / 5! I love how many options there are without even getting anything premium. It reminds me a bit of beatsaber because you hit stuff while there's epic music playing. There's a fun mode called ""freeplay"" where you can just punch wherever you want, as fast as you want. The only problem with this game is that the monthly / yearly premium is so expensive. (I understand why though)"
1150,Johnathan Frazier,Jun 29 at 10:00 PM,5,Tons of Fun,Wasnt sure how we would enjoy it but the wife and I had loads of fun while also using it for a work out. Easy way to work up a sweat and get the calories burning!
1151,Cricket,Jul 19 at 9:16 PM,3,I like it,The subscription is too much but the free version is pretty much basic. I liked it. I was doing the 10min workout and it had me out of breathe.
1152,Serenity,Jul 29 at 10:52 PM,5,The best game for workouts,very useful
1153,RIPCORD,Jul 10 at 10:21 PM,4,great workout,I kept seeing ads for the game and wow did not disappoint. Basic free subscription is just good enough to get in your workout. I see the premium worth the money.
1154,Chris Wells,Jun 12 at 9:11 PM,5,Great Start,First- playing for two days. Switched to 3000 punches as a daily goal. Definitely working the shoulders! I haven’t used a physical Lite Boxer machine but this is pretty sweet. Sweating quite a bit and burning calories. Definitely recommend!!
1155,Big mack,Jul 15 at 12:57 AM,5,Great,it has great music and a nice workout when you need one im glad i downloaded this
1156,Tillz,Jul 12 at 2:58 AM,4,Very glad I downloaded,"Very pleased with this game, only complaint is they offered a 30 free trial for premium but when I signed up, it only was a week trial. Still a fun game."
1157,Jerin,"May 17, 2022 at 3:06 PM",5,GREAT WORKOUT,I absolutely love this game! I definitely feel the burn in my arms! Can’t wait for more songs to be added!
1158,DogsRock,Jun 30 at 7:19 PM,5,LOVE THIS GAME AND ADDICTING,I use the free version and LOVE it. I definitely get my heart rate up. The music gets you motivated and you can even challenge friends . Great fun!!
1159,Steve,Jul 12 at 10:38 PM,5,fun way to get fit,The gym is not for me but this is a great fun way to keep fit and get the heart pumping.
1160,katies38,Jul 12 at 5:17 AM,5,Liteboxer,Really loved the basic to start great music and fun trainers. Will likely do the 30 trial
1161,Curt81,"May 17, 2022 at 2:30 AM",3,Improvements made. Still needs work tho,"I decided to give this a try, despite the negative reviews and I liked it enough to pay for a subscription.  It's great they are listening and making changes, such as offering a free membership.  I do find the subscription price to be too high ($28 here in Canada).  More features need to be added to make this worth that amount and also not a fan of instructors being on the side while you're trying to box.  It's hard to follow along.  I do like the punch tracker, where you can choose the music you want to hear, while working out.  I found hand tracking to be hit and miss, but with the controllers, I had no issues.  Looking forward to more updates in the future."
1162,Jacoba_14,Jun 30 at 9:04 PM,5,Amazing alternative,Liteboxer is a perfect way to have fun and workout at the same time. I wasn’t sure about it at first but I tried it out and I really liked it
1163,Mgagman,"May 26, 2022 at 10:05 PM",4,"So far, so good","I've been at this VR thing now for about two weeks.  While I haven't signed up for a subscription, i have used Lite Boxer every day since I purchased my Oculus Quest 2.  It's fun and is better than sitting around.  I may opt in for more as time goes on, but for now it's my 10 minute morning routine."
1164,Brooklynne_21_Softball,Jul 25 at 6:05 PM,1,1 star rating,I don’t want to pay a monthly or weekly or yearly fee just to play a stupid game
1165,Ralph,Jul 22 at 8:25 PM,4,Worth the subscription.,New songs and workouts make the subscription worth it. An overall great cardio experience!
1166,Eric Delarosa,Jun 10 at 5:27 PM,4,surprised in a good way,"I saw the Instagram and facebook posts about this but with the actual shield.  when i saw this i was excited but also figured it was not gonna be as good as the real thing.  i was right and wrong.  the goods are that still give me a great work out and makes me sweat, the basic subscription is great and it is challenging.  the bad is that u rather actually connect with something on the punches, the songs are limited, and no way to really track what u have done already. over all like it and made it almost a daily routine."
1167,moogs8,Jul 5 at 9:04 PM,5,great boxing workout,"I just got the basic package for this game earlier this week. So far its been easy to use, fun, and a good workout!"
1168,KC,Jul 6 at 11:01 PM,5,Fun workout,The free access is good and tough enough to get a good sweat on.  It's a fun pattern matching punch session.
1169,Goldie dude,Jun 2 at 5:48 PM,5,great movement,"got this on occulous quest,what a great workout,i'm 68 and trying to keep fit and this has been a great motivator for me,the routines are easy to follow although sometimes a bit fast but practice makes perfect.really happy with this,its good excersise and not over strenuous."
1170,Bandit,Jun 21 at 5:47 AM,3,Pretty good but could have more,It’s a pretty good game and they actually have a free option with a decent amount of stuff but having a paid version just kinda ruins it for me. I would rather do a one time purchase and get access to everything than having to pay for another subscription service
1171,gamerwalt,Jun 24 at 2:13 AM,5,Beautiful,This is now what I do most of the time when I want to while away time. Love the music and love the tempo as well. This was well thought out. Kudos to the makers. Lovely
1172,Vers,Jul 21 at 11:33 AM,5,Interesting,For a free game it is quite good
1173,Cody Griffin,Jun 9 at 9:47 PM,5,A great boxing workout,"Of all the various VR boxing workout apps, I think Liteboxer strikes the perfect value balance. The membership is affordable and the workout options are extensive. There is a great selection of music, even for the basic, free membership."
1174,Quin,Jul 8 at 9:47 PM,4,Liteboxer,It is fun and it will have you working your arms and body out. I like the music that is able to be choosen as well as the trainers that help you out.
1175,Joe L,Jun 21 at 9:16 PM,4,Great App to burn some extra calories,"I am always looking for ways to burn calories while also having fun doing it…This app checks those boxes. Only thing keeping me from giving if 5 stars is im bit a hige fan of the music they use, but thats just my personal preference"
1176,Ninjaboyz,Jun 10 at 8:54 PM,5,The perfect work out game,Lite boxer is a perfect game for fitness working out and losing weight and the quick play for songs like blinding lights is the most fun thing I ever played listening to my favorite song and punching the circle 5/5 oculus essential
1177,despairx,Jun 27 at 4:38 AM,5,Its super fun and addicting,"I LOVE THIS A LOT, ITS BECOME A HOBBY FOR ME TO LOG ONTO VR AND PLAY THIS GAME! definitely recommend for those who'd like to get better at exercising"
1178,alsatian5,Jun 12 at 11:16 PM,3,Meh,"The parts I played either were too fast or too slow. I wish there was longer training that had more variety and took longer to go from zero to sixty. The punches don’t seem satisfying either. I want to feel them more to know I’ve connected — physically and visually. I’ll try playing more but my alternative games are much more enjoyable. This needs a bigger hook and some other facet to be a go-to, for me. Something more explosive."
1179,jojo,Jun 26 at 7:10 AM,5,worth it !,honestly i like the game and everything! the music taste 👨🏽‍🍳🤌🏽💋 the app is really easy to use and the subscription is worth it too !
1180,TNWanderer,Jun 7 at 3:22 PM,4,Good for cardio,It's a good program for cardio.  Though my biggest issue is the video being so offset when taking a class and the songs are tunes no one has heard of.  I realize that there is a licence issue but it would be nice to have 1 song that most people know to see how good it would be to buy the extra songs or subscription
1181,Lisurge,Jul 21 at 2:28 AM,4,Not to shabby,Like it not to sure on the premium price might have to give it a trial at somepoint
1182,Alexandria,Jun 14 at 4:13 AM,5,Exciting,I only recently started playing and i'm already addicted. Even with the basic songs and membership it's easy to get immersed into the game you don't even realize you're working out. Would definitely recommend.
1183,iShogun,Jun 6 at 10:41 PM,5,actually a great game!,"This Fitness title is amazing for being free, well if you want to play songs you know you have to pay but its worth getting without paying if you just wanna work out."
1184,efra1979,Jul 6 at 9:16 PM,5,great work out tool.,"honestly one of my favorite apps great workout im sweating ,heart rate is up in minutes..."
1185,Tony,"May 26, 2022 at 12:34 AM",5,Fantastic boxing app,"I love this app, it’s challenging but fun.
I love the way I can choose a short workout or a longer one if I’m feeling energetic.
I’ve only had the app for a week, but It’s making me fitter already, and the different challenges mean I won’t get bored of using it.
It’s such a great app, the only improvement I think could be made is to have the targets numbered on the easy levels for the faster punch combinations.
I’ve tried a few boxercise apps, this is the best by far👏👍"
1186,JC,"May 25, 2022 at 11:18 PM",5,Enjoying the workout,"I track my heart rate and steps using an Amazfit Trex, when it rains or is just too miserable outside I've been using my Oculus for exercise inside. I was pleasantly surprised at the intensity of the workouts I've managed to gain out of the free membership with Lite Boxer, my heart rate easily reaching and even surpassing what I would normally get during my morning walks. Very happy with this addition to my Oculus library."
1187,Dave F Macias,"May 12, 2022 at 1:37 AM",3,Change of ♥️ I now give 3-1/2⭐️⭐️⭐️,"(Way better now)…!!
originally I gave it a 1-star and I thought this company was totally greedy and unfair and the game was way ridiculously over priced.
(But now… I had a total change of heart)…
They have now Allow us to have the demo for free and I believe the price went down.
I’m very happy that this company decided to work with us,  (The-Customers). 
It is why now,  I’m changing this (1-Star), to: a (3-1/2-Stars)-!!   We are now,  A very very happy customer.
(TwoThumbs-Way-Up)-!!   👍🏻👍🏻😁
————————————————
(Old-Review before it got better).
Really it should be free for what it is.
Way...   Overpriced!  $$$
I like this app as a warm-up, But that's all it is.
And they only give you a Demo for 5-days only.
They should just leave the demo in place.
If it was a 1-time, (Fee/Buy), I would buy it. 
But:  (not as a):  (monthly expense fee)."
1188,ChelleG,"May 26, 2022 at 11:32 PM",5,Getting fit while having fun,I am new to Oculus and this is the first app that i tried. I am having a heck of a time. The quick workouts help me get my heart rate up and break a sweat. I recommend this to beginners as well as more advanced boxers.
1189,Hotdogman,Aug 2 at 11:50 PM,1,It sucks,It sucks they make you pay to play it
1190,Mr.G.Reaper,Jun 6 at 9:24 AM,4,Great but just a wee bit pricey,"It's a really good way to get a quick exercise in. A good exercise for me and the whole fam. A great and fun way for my boys to stay in shape an get their exercise in when we can't leave. We actually work up a sweat playing this however I do wish the subscription was cheaper. It is a bit pricey, but it is cool you offer to pay off a year though so there's that."
1191,Whitty,"May 25, 2022 at 10:44 PM",5,Great workout compliment,"This app provides a great workout for both your body and mind. It forces you to really move and concentrate improving your coordination, muscle memory and overall fitness all at the same time. I use it as a replacement for the ordinary cardio sessions to make cardio enjoyable and exciting again!"
1192,clifford casey,Jul 28 at 12:02 AM,4,Great game,i Really love it and think its great i
1193,Clockstar,"May 25, 2022 at 10:06 PM",5,Great Workout,"I’m using the free version of Lite Boxer so my 5 star review is from that perspective. This game is a great cardio workout but also builds speed, reflex, and accuracy.  Will this excite me enough to go for the paid version? Maybe not but as a free enhancement to my workout routine  its great."
1194,Notyurs,Jul 11 at 5:31 AM,5,Awesome!,This game is a great workout. Makes you move! Truly a great game!
1195,wayne,"May 17, 2022 at 5:36 AM",5,love it,Nice no frills work out! Awesome music library. great cardio work out.
1196,Godmiya,Jun 1 at 9:03 PM,5,Review,The app was amazing and it was fun to play the songs and also learn how to box. It taught me loads of things and everyone should try it out.
1197,Jupiter,Jul 8 at 9:41 PM,5,I love this it starts my workouts right,LOVE MY LITEBOXER STARTS MY WORKOUTS RIGHT🥰🥰💯💯💯💪💪💪
1198,DeadAF,Jun 10 at 7:41 AM,3,Has Potential,"There are alot of cool features and options while working out with this program and It's great that they have a free tier. I will continue to try out the free tier and see if you can make your own platlylist without trying to  challenge someone. However, there are still several things that need to be fixed i.e. not being able to skip warmups, menu defaulting back to beginning after every workout and hooks not registering and/or being utilized enough."
1199,Diegothenegro,Jul 8 at 9:03 PM,5,Best boxing app,I like this app because it can really keep you concentrated on your goal
1200,Kurry3zero,Aug 4 at 12:45 AM,1,Bad,It bad
1201,Amber lousie,Jul 15 at 12:21 PM,5,Great app,Very good app really enjoyed playing
1202,Tae,Jun 21 at 9:17 PM,5,WOW IN LOVE,this app is awesome i have no experience boxing and im learning to much from this i think after the trail is over i might keep it or try the free membership
1203,Jeff,Jun 20 at 10:03 PM,5,So fun!,"The free option is great and has enough variety to make it fun/challenging! I wish I could buy the game because the 
subscription is unfortunately unaffordable."
1204,CottonCandy,Jul 11 at 12:27 AM,4,Pretty cool,"I wish there was more available without the added charges,  but it's a cool game & I'll keep doing the free workouts!"
1205,Skylor,Jul 7 at 8:38 PM,4,liteboxer,this is overall outstanding game without having to spend money there is options to purchase premium and other thing i love this game
1206,Lester Emerson,Jun 27 at 2:59 AM,4,A real workout,I can honestly say that this game kept me interested and winded lol.  The music selections are cool and the sequenced punching kept me swaeting like I actually was training.  Great app!
1207,user_365149890545315,Jul 1 at 3:45 PM,5,,I’m 32 and Liteboxer has helped me with working out my arms and helps keep up with my boxing skills
1208,Andy,Jul 3 at 3:00 PM,5,Great Game,"I downloaded the game a few day ago.
it is a great for keeping fit i would recommended it"
1209,Cecelia,"Apr 21, 2022 at 7:37 PM",4,Great upper body workout!,"I love the app but when it comes down to fitness subscriptions if you want to scale down, this one would be put on hold. The music selection is excellent and that is what sets this one apart. I’ll probably re subscribe at half the price.  I just don’t use it enough for full price."
1210,JustinTAO,Jun 3 at 4:59 AM,4,Worthy of your attention,"I've tried many fitness applications throughout my use of the Meta Quest, like Supernatual. Some were solid in concept and others just didn't work at all. Liteboxer has been by far the most solid VR Fitness program I've used. The not only the subscription service has improved since the release of their Liteboxer product, but the range of workouts and drills available. If it's any service, this is the one."
1211,Shorty186,Jul 3 at 10:56 PM,5,awesome,lite boxer is a really cool game and i am very happy you added a free membership to it.
1212,Brandon,Jun 18 at 10:31 PM,5,Great workout,This was a great workout and i really recommend it if your going to wanna do some boxing workouts and stuff was pretty good but wish they had better music in here
1213,Oscar farq,Jul 17 at 11:57 PM,5,Very active,Very fun as well
1214,Keyerra07,Jul 1 at 7:40 PM,4,Great workout,"I recently just discovered this app and started the free trial. 
I can honestly say this is a great workout. I will definitely purchase the premium plan!"
1215,Jo,Jul 9 at 9:03 PM,4,A good workout,The game is fun and a good alternative for when i can’t go to the gym. Just wish there were more song options.
1216,Mania UK,Jun 19 at 10:50 PM,5,One of the best exercise app in vr,This is one of the best exercise apps in standalone vr that actually helps you be get fit and there is even an instructor to show you what you need to do.
1217,Ace,Jun 21 at 11:53 PM,5,best fit app!,I absolutely love this workout and i love how easy it is to learn! im hopeful i can lose weight and get healthy with this added to my regimen!

1220,samantha McMillan,Jul 19 at 6:38 PM,4,Its ok a little expensive,its expensive for what they want with premium. but the for the free version you get some song's and a few workouts and drills

1224,Waffleislife,Jun 4 at 5:13 PM,5,Amazing!,"As someone who took some time away from working out, this was more than the right app to download! The feel of having a trainer with so many choices of music makes a workout from home feel like you never left the gym!"
1225,Breezy,Jun 8 at 9:10 PM,5,Enjoyed It,"I enjoyed working out to the music. For someone that’s ADHD, it helps to have the flashing lights and music going. I can see myself working out to this everyday, adding it to my workout routine."
1226,Trashydcp,Jul 1 at 11:42 PM,5,Liteboxer,Love this game and it's a great workout. Highly recommended for any age 👌 👍
1227,Shanna,Jun 16 at 9:22 PM,5,Great warm-up,"Just got this but is working fantastic, helping with foot work and accurate punching method. Have tried a couple of other app and these are working great."
1228,Shellpish,Jun 7 at 12:00 AM,5,Love this app freemium subscription!!,I am loving this app! They have a free basic or freemium subscription! Thats the one I have. Great music to get you into the workout! Quick plays or timed workouts! This is a daily log into game for me!!

1234,Riverbug,Jun 11 at 1:11 AM,5,Free!! Amazing app within my budget!,I wish the premium wasnt so expensive a month. The free subscription is great too and has a variety of songs. maybe theyll do a discount subscription sale? Love the app though!!
1235,Erika,"May 18, 2022 at 10:24 PM",5,Fun workout,Ive enjoyed the app. Love that it tracks my score and gives and idea on how to properly use. love the song choices… could add more though.
1236,Tyrone,Jun 24 at 10:57 PM,3,so far so good,"its alright so far, just have to get used to the counts, i wish in the workouts the trainer would be behind the punch machine with the pads like the trainer to help out, but i’ll get it"
1237,MiaMoms,Jun 2 at 5:33 PM,2,It's an okay workout...,"I gave this a try as I love FitXR so was hoping this would be comparable. It's really not even close honestly. After a FitXR workout I am covered in sweat and can feel the burn. I found Liteboxer hard to navigate, too many instructional pieces you can't bypass, and just not as great of a workout."
1238,Griffin Family,Jul 13 at 12:45 AM,5,fun,very fun game
1239,Raychaell829,Jun 27 at 9:10 PM,3,not a lot of options,"i didnt really care for it. it offers a free version with next to the nothing on there, but the paid version didnt have too much variety either especially for the price."
1240,Lord Edward Stark King of Winterfell,Jun 3 at 9:31 PM,4,Decent Boxing Training,"Even the free membership is awesome, you can practice your own style or complete of the drills that’s available. in my opinion for the time i used the app i broke out a sweat and i felt really good overall after using this application. i recommend this personally"
1241,Vergaraaa,Jun 22 at 10:54 PM,5,Good 10 minute workout!,So far it's been a good workout and it also has some good starter songs if you don't want to pay a subscription
1242,dougfunne,Jul 3 at 10:40 PM,5,good if you dont want to leave the hous,a great cardio workout without having to leave the house
1243,Kyler,Jul 10 at 1:51 AM,5,,Very good for working out
1244,JackRabbit,"Apr 2, 2022 at 7:59 PM",1,Don't Fall for It,"It's another one of those games that lead you to believe that you can get some sort of play for free.  Once they force you to sign up for it, they spring the subscription on you.  Seems dishonest to me.

Look.  The game is rated two stars at the time of this review, and they want you to subscribe at $18.99 per month!  I think I will stick to The Thrill of the Fight.  Unless there are real professional boxes or coaches out there personally coaching me, it's not worth any sort of subscription model. I don't know why anyone would pay $1 per month for such a lowly rated app."
1245,Funny-Name-haha,Jul 3 at 12:55 AM,4,Government watching me?,Ok this app is great and all but it comes up on my fyp the DAY after I wanna start boxing. Coincidence? I think NOT!
1246,DrewTheShoe,"Mar 6, 2022 at 10:19 PM",2,VR Fitness Boxing done mostly wrong,"First off, let's clarify what some other reviewers got wrong: There's like a mini trial with limited access, but then if you ""sign up"" and activate the 7-day free trial with your email, you can use all the content. It's A LOT of content.

The good: there's a ton of music, songs you know, big hits. I'm impressed! Like, hundreds of songs and classes with trainers etc. 

The bad: The environment is not fun. You're staring at a black mechanical punching bag with little lights. VR has rarely been so uninspiring.
The mechanics of the Liteboxer thing you're punching are bland and occasionally very glitchy. More on that later.

The very bad: in the coaching classes (a big part of the game), the music is very quiet, the coaching is loud, and the punching feedback sound effect is very loud. At max volume on the headset, you cannot keep the beat of the song over the trainer's talking and the punching sound effects. That's no way to work out. It's supposed to be a rhythm game! There are no audio settings of any kind (!!!) That leads us to:

The total dealbraker: The punch feedback (sound effect and vibration) is always a little late. I'd guess about 20-30 milliseconds late. You may be wondering why I would have an innate gauge of how long 20 ms feels. Well, I'm an audio engineer. And that's just enough time to completely throw off the rhythm. It's no longer a ""rhythm game""
I'm not doing it wrong, either. Each punch is scored for timing, and there's a visual cue the moment you hit the bag. Throw the punch, hit the bag, then wait. Or, you can hit the bag slightly early (which feels weird punching off the beat) and get partially penalized for your poor timing, but at least the sound effect will be in time with the song! I REPEAT: there are no audio settings of any kind.
2 stars for the biggest content library in VR Fitness. But I don't want to use any of it.
Anyway, I'm off to see if Les Mills is everything it's cracked up to be."
1247,John Getz,Jun 1 at 9:14 PM,5,fun workout,gives me a fun option of working out at home. the subscription price is bad to boot  either.

1265,SaucedPapi,Jun 26 at 12:28 AM,5,best subcription so far,it has helped me alot to get up and actually move around force me to workout
1266,Korvus,"May 25, 2022 at 9:48 PM",4,A Good Free Experience,Liteboxer is simple but it kept me motivated to continue with it's trainer videos and rhythm-based song sequences. It's probably not the best for outright boxing but works well for me as cardio. The free content is somewhat constrained but considering it's free I have no real complaints.
1267,Detilly,"May 26, 2022 at 1:01 AM",5,I love it!,"I was not expecting anything with Liteboxer, but I love it! I didn't thought I would sweat like that. It's a great training. I only use the free subscription, it's enough for me and there's a lot of song to play. Not sure? Try it!"

The haptics are ridiculously good and the songs are so fun to move to. I did one of the classes first and actually feel like I learned some terminology and boxing basics.

learning the sport. Pretty cool!"
1273,Jimmy neutron,Jul 9 at 8:14 AM,5,,Fun
1274,Free Cap,Jun 20 at 12:30 AM,5,Great Game,Lite boxer provides an excellent workout with real instructors and music to make the exercise fun.

1276,Alfonso,Jun 26 at 11:19 PM,5,good,"i worked out for hours and i love it, and i love the songs to"
1277,Skyrules,Jul 3 at 9:24 PM,4,Fun!,The kids love this game! They found a different and  fun way to get some exercise.
1278,Mrs.Yatta,"May 25, 2022 at 10:20 PM",3,A Good Warmup,"I use this app to warm me up before my workouts. It's a good concept, but it is bare bones right now. I would like to see more search options (an easy way to find workout intensity levels, length workouts, etc) that would allow me to click what Im looking for and limit it to just that, instead of having to go through song by song, etc. Other than adding few bells and whistles, it's a good app that gets me warmed up for my other workout apps."
1279,CFour,"May 25, 2022 at 11:22 PM",4,Decent and fun workout,"The game as a concept is pretty fun and engaging but the aspect having to pay for a premium
subscription is what kills it. You can play without it, but if want to box to some well known songs you need to have a subscription and I think almost 20 bucks a month is way too much."
1280,Collin,Jun 14 at 9:20 PM,4,what a great game!!,i am a 24 year old male i like this game alot i thjnm yhey could add a little more to the free option but other then that i think its great it really kicks my butt playing it.

1284,Distortedyeet,Jun 18 at 5:02 AM,1,False advertising,It says its free but it costs a membership that is really stupid i don’t recommend it
1285,AnthonytheGuyMan,Jun 27 at 4:05 AM,4,Really good,"I like this just like I like thrill of the fight, but there's no competition only repeatedly hitting to a beat"
1286,Rainelle,Jun 22 at 10:56 PM,4,Great Alternative,I love that it has a free option to make sure i enjoy using it! It works great as an alternative to being able to do it in person.
1287,Delcz,Jun 28 at 9:11 PM,4,good quick workouts,the workouts are hard but last a perfect amount of time. easy to follow and good track list as well.

1290,FitProVR,"Apr 20, 2022 at 12:06 PM",2,FitProVR Review of Liteboxer,"Review Update:
As of April 20th, I wanted to change my review as there have been some updates to this application and I don't think it's fair for me or anyone to keep an old review if the developers are making adjustments.
I'll speak mostly to the mitt holding drills. This was a much needed addition to the VR space and I think it gives Liteboxer a fresh take on cardio boxing that no other apps are doing. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. The trainers are still very flat, 2D, and low res.  In my opinion it's still not worth the subscription price unless you also have the LB physical device as well (this would make a good supplementary travel workout). 
I like the energy of the trainers and it seems like LB did a good job of listening to the reviews here and adjusting fire as needed. Keep hustling LB team, it still has a ways to go.

--------Previous Review Below--------

Hi! My name is Ari and I'm the content creator for FitProVR - I reviewed this game this week and .......WOW! I've never played a worse, lazy, sloppy, and pointless fitness game in my entire existence. There are so many things to cover here so I recommend checking out the video I made on this game (link at the bottom), but here's a quick overview:
-The workouts are lame, and mimic the real life liteboxer workouts, and nothing else.
-This game just ISN'T fun. Who in their right mind wants to play punch-a-mole for 30 minutes?
-Every video is low-res and is of terrible quality.

I can find no redeeming qualities of this application. There seem to be so many ""good"" reviews of this on blogs and even here, but they all seem super contrived. Check out my video for the full rundown:

1291,DrElemayo,Jun 13 at 3:35 AM,5,actually gets me going,"on the free version atm, and the first few days have been crazy. didn't expect to sweat like i have, and it's super fun!"

1299,MooseTheKing,Jun 1 at 9:29 PM,4,overall ok,the game is fun and is definitely a workout allthough i wish there was more options without buying premium.
1300,bluestang1774,"May 26, 2022 at 12:02 AM",5,just starting,just started using this definitely a good work out . As I advance im looking into the premium subscription.  Just had reconstructive surgery on my ankle a year ago . The bouncing helps with flex ability.
1301,skyzdalimit1124,Jun 1 at 9:05 PM,5,Great,Great game love the challenges I use it everyday
1302,SERENiTY,Jun 2 at 9:05 PM,5,Love the music,The Music is fun (Lil Wayne and Ariana Grande songs) makes me forget im even working out and it’s only been one day of playing and i keep wanna do it even more
1303,Abraham,Jun 15 at 10:33 AM,5,Perfect alternative,This game is really good to help you lose weight and help you concentrate on the beat and the timing
1304,Archangel5,Jun 7 at 9:44 PM,5,"Liteboxer, LOVE IT!",I was skeptical about getting this game since I have other boxing games but love developing eye hand cordination and the better music.
1305,koalajoe,"May 6, 2022 at 5:05 PM",3,Too expensive,"Update 5/5/22:  Glad they are listening.  Now it comes with free Basic content, instead of locking those without a subscription out.  There are rooms for improvement, I hope they will get better and better.  Updated from 2-star to 3-star, will update again.  

The good: I do get a good workout
- good variety of workout with different levels
- can choose by song (like Beat Saber, as opposed to SN or FitXR or Les Mills, that have a set of songs)

The bad:
- $18.99 per month is too expensive (now there is a free basic option)
- not registering hit frequently, especially upper cuts
- not sure how to describe it, but a lot of times the choreography and music timing do not match (not in sync)
- The video tutorial at the start of the workout:  The video placement is odd.  You have to look to your left to watch the video, but the hitting pad is in front of me, making it difficult to follow.  Also the angle of the instrutor does not show how they hit the pad.  Perhaps the video should be in front, superimposing on the pad, in first-person view hitting the pad in front of you (hope it makes sense)"
1306,Jonny,Jun 22 at 7:34 PM,5,Hook!,First time using lite boxer now I want to do it everyday !
1307,Mike,Jun 14 at 4:46 AM,3,It’s a really great app,I like the app gave me a good workout and is really fun just when I’m doing the mit mode it’s hard to see the target with the teacher there and stuff but other then that I love it.
1308,Taylor,Jul 11 at 9:56 PM,4,good fitness for vr,good for keeping fit

1310,Hermione22,Jun 8 at 2:13 AM,4,My daughter love it !!!!,"The reason I don't give you 5 stars is that you need to pay a monthly premium also you will have an option for an annual fee and good price. but still, I love the basic is amazing. Thanks"
1311,Disneybeautyqueen,"May 26, 2022 at 3:33 PM",5,best workout,I really like this game. It gets your heart pumping and your body moving. I would recommend this game to anyone.

1315,riah,"Mar 4, 2022 at 1:15 AM",5,Fantastic through and through,"I've been a huge fan of beat saber and rhythm games in general for a while, so I was really excited when Liteboxer came to VR! Sure, there may be a paywall, but it's way cooler than going to a gym imo. I also don't have to worry about the social anxiety that comes with a gym membership 😅 punching lights in such a sleek environment is much preferred."
1316,Adean Nava,Jun 2 at 9:05 PM,5,Liteboxer,This game is actually really fun It’s good for exercise and to help your body get in shape. I also let my mom use it and she also like it reall much

1322,Brandon,Jun 27 at 9:07 PM,4,Perfect workout,Don't use it as much as I want to but I enjoy the app. It's a great workout.
1323,Virgil,"Mar 3, 2022 at 11:06 PM",3,Disappointing,I used the free trial and I was greeted with the most basic setup you can imagine. I had to hit a flat board that's close enough to cause vergence accommodation conflict to some music that seems barely related to the points floating on the board. That's it. That's the whole game.
1324,TT,"May 26, 2022 at 4:19 PM",4,Good Stress Reliever,Lite is my go to exercise/stress relief vr game. I love that I can work up a sweat. To me it is as close to a real experience without risking injury as I like.

Not everyone has a planet fitness for 10 bucks,  SO if You call thie a GAME you clearly don't understand their intentions, Also i am willing too bet they actually have listened songs..

1341,Jeff,"Mar 4, 2022 at 9:18 PM",3,Meh,"The game/app itself is not bad. I enjoyed boxing to the selected music. I did a workout and it was a little odd. If it was a one-time purchase I would buy it but no way would I pay a monthly subscription for it. UI needs quite a bit of work as well but it’s brand new. 

Les Mills Bodycombat is far superior not even factoring in that it’s currently a one-time purchase. I use that one every day and sadly I will uninstall Liteboxer since it won’t let me do the demo anymore."

I can't figure out how to cancel the trial before I'm changed $19 a month. I have contacted the company through their website after going through all membership/account/support drop-downs from my email link, their site, the oculus app, and the app in oculus. They haven't responded and I can't quit. I'm totally getting charged. Also, you get charged unless you quit by day 6 if the 7 day trial. They tell you that on day 5."

I wasn't interested and it did not have the option to exit out of the Liteboxing App. I had to finish the set up for the free trial. I don't feel that is a good marketing technique. The Liteboxing app should have the disclaimer of a free trial, $18.99/month up front."

(Punch tracks are loads of fun too, just not what I think makes it worth subscribing.)"
1370,Dogman,"May 6, 2022 at 8:46 PM",2,"Still not impressed, sorry LB","Updated 5/5/22:

I checked out the update, and other than the bug fix (thanks for listening and fixing), the tone of my review still stands.  I did notice the new features and options but my feeling during experiencing the improved LB it that I wish I was spending my valuable workout time on superior products like the similarly priced Supernatural or the cheaper Les Mills Body Combat, Fitxr or Thrill of the Fight.  The big problem with LB is the basic structure with punching the VR version of LB is simply not compelling enough to continue using it when there are several better workout options.  I also noticed a couple of the trainers in LB are also in FitXr.

LB simply is not as good of a workout experience compared to superior (and sometimes much cheaper) options.


Old review:  The comparison to Supernatural is valid as they are similar in price, in both monthly and annual options.  I am taking the 7 day trial as I do use the quest 2 primarily for fitness.

LBs coaching is superior to SN with better advice regarding form.  But that is it's only advantage, over SN.  SN's boxing is more varied with more opportunities for slips, ducks, blocks and dodges.  The music in both is outstanding.  The number of box workout options in both are plentiful for any level.  I prefer SN's box due to the defensive aspects missing in LB and the environments in SN are superior.  

With SN you also get the flow workouts, so the value proposition is no contest.  SN is simply superior.  In fact if it is coaching you are looking for, I prefer LesMills Body Combat's coaching to LB.  

I won't be subscribing after my week is up. I will play it some more and update this if my view changes. The cost isn't the issue.  There are better options, I actually would choose FitXr over LB with their HIIT option as well, although FitXr music and coaching is more limited.

2nd day addendum. Did a few more training sessions, with different trainers, the positive experience I had with the first LB trainer did not translate to the other trainers, on balance SN box training is better.

Also spun a few sessions with individual songs.  There are roughly 100 songs to choose from mostly current stuff but with some classic rock mixed in.  trainers do not talk over the tunes as with SN.  You have the flexibility to choose your own playlist.  But the SN tune library is much deeper but the tunes are imbedded in the curated workout playlist.  I prefer the deeper library, but some in SN have complained about the inability to choose individual tunes.  A matter of taste.

I also had to sign in again with my email and password to get back in to LB.  A facepalm moment, why this isn't saved in the device to prevent wasted time is inexcusable.    

After these two sessions I have cancelled my free trial.  No need to return"

1388,Alan Ritchie,"Mar 8, 2022 at 3:27 AM",1,Very Expensive for the subscription,"The game allows you to play a couple notable/well known songs at first which is fantastic. Although there are some bugs in this game. But those can be fixed.

However, the subscription is very expensive at $18.99 USD a month. I understand that is to cover licensing costs as this game does have a very decent size music catalog. But I just wish the game itself was a paid for game, and you could purchase what songs you may or may not want (similar to Beatsaber). I wouldn't mind dropping $10-15 on the game and buying each song that I would like for $2 or so. But getting into a subscription on a month to month basis? That's just not for me.

No multi-player either so if that's what you want this game does not offer that. 

I also found the ""Hard"" difficulty to not be that hard, and I am in no way shape or form a boxer or anything

$18.99 USD for a subscription is just insane. That's over $200 a year. I don't know, there's just better fitness games than this one. To each their own I guess."
1389,Kaizen Ultra,"Mar 8, 2022 at 2:36 PM",1,Absolute joke,"This can't even be compared to anything else out there, this can't even compete with fitxr witch to me on the bottom of the list of boxing VR games. 

Look it's fun, but not more than 5 mins I would keep this around if it was free or maybe pay for it if it was under 20, but a monthly sub of 19 LMAO. 

Any 5 star reviews are fake for sure, there is no way anyone would give this a 5 star and say it's the best out there unless they are from the company.

You all need to rethink this game, because as it stands right now, it's going to fall flat, compared to less combat that's 30, and super natural that actually deserves 19 a month."

1404,Ha-root,"Mar 4, 2022 at 4:07 PM",1,Nope,"I assume they thought if they made a VR game people would buy the real unit… this game would make me not want to buy the real unit .

1. Overall poor choice of colors. Why make the game so gloomy and dark? 

2. Buggy: lots of bugs need to be addressed

3. It’s not a trial, it’s a demo.  If you believe in your product like supernatural and fit xr do; why not give a full trial?

4. The arcade/casino like sounds after you finish need to go. 

5. What’s up with the whole having to reach in and use a virtual finger to click menu options… just use laser pointer like everyone else . 

6. Looks like they will have some good music … 

7. can’t tell if I would break out a sweat. Def did not with the trial music . 

I’m not being like everyone else when I say this, but you need to pull and redo this game before it hurts your brand. I always considered buying the physical version but now I’d be questioning the quality ."

It took 8 tries to load a single music track, and when it finally did, I was disappointed. As a music game it feels super weak and falls flat compared to Beat Saber or Audio Trip, and as a boxing/fitness experience it's really uninspiring. Thrill of the fight has a stationary dummy with targets I can hit, and that whole game is $9.99 once, not an audacious $18.99 a month.

1412,Brian,"Mar 5, 2022 at 11:44 AM",1,Haptics are nothing special,"Every fitness app has similar haptics where you feel the controller vibrate at the supposed point of impact. This is not unique or special. It’s the norm. Don’t fall for the reviewing touting haptics. Other than that I don’t understand the point of this app. 

Let’s list all the cons:

If you’re not familiar with the company, they sell a physical version of what you see in the app. What I don’t understand is why they had to limit themselves to the physical product when they’re in virtual reality? In nearly every other fitness app, they have fantastic flying targets to hit that keeps your interest. The core gameplay is just boring. Another problem is that there’s no variety.

The environment is terrible. You’re stuck inside a green room vs better environments that you find in Fit XR, Body Combat, Supernatural, Thrill of the Fight and even Beat Saber. Did they product designer not play VR prior to this?

The subscription price at $19 / month is just as steep as Supernatural minus all the features, trainers, workout variety, and beautiful environments. FitXR costs about $6 / month and even that has more variety, better and more fun workouts, and better environments. Body Combat, Beat Saber, and Thrill of the Fight and other apps like Player 22 have no subscription. If people are mainly paying for songs, I’d rather just use that money for Spotify.

There are no good visual cues for dodging. In other games, you dodge walls or even blocky obstacles. In this game, you have to rely on their virtual version of an extremely limited device which is just weird and lazy.

There’s no competition. I compete with other players on Body Combat, Beat Saber, and FitXR. It’s great and it keeps me going. There’s nothing here despite $19/ month.

The initial menus didn’t even load for me. I didn’t know what I was getting into since all the buttons except for one was blank.

I would have more bad things to say about this app but I couldn’t stand it after a few minutes. I have nothing good to say about this. Don’t even bother. It’s a waste of time."

1415,AndyM,"Mar 14, 2022 at 1:04 PM",4,Good overall exercise !,"Yes it is annoying to have to subscribe, but if they can keep on top of new content then on balance its worth while.
The trainers are good and the boxing is intuitive and once you get into it ,just want to carry on a little longer!
Room for improvement : Sometimes the uppercuts dont register , which  affects your score and is annoying.
To be able to search for a workout between certain lengths , not just under a certain length.
To have a live session with a trainer, similar to peloton?
To be able to connect with others online and workout/compete together."
1416,Bree mollaun,"Mar 7, 2022 at 6:44 PM",1,Lackluster,"I am an avid user of VR workouts my core work out of choice being a Supernatural. I have lost over 100 pounds using diet and almost exclusively VR workouts. I have tried most of the standalone VR workout apps on oculus and this one is not one I'll be adding to my rotation especially given the subscription base. 

What I do like, the moments are traditional so having proper form is possible. No hammer strikes or sky punches or anything else that can lead to improper form and thus injury. Other than overextension of your punches, this workout seems to be one of the better workouts when it comes to being able to use proper form. My problem then is this. I'm so busy trying to figure out where my next punch is coming from that my punches lack in my ability to actually do the proper form. I find my workout and strikes being medeocre at best and my ability to add core workout nearly impossible. I think the strike box and position is just too close for me. 

Interface and coaches: interface is lacking again for some reason following the ""light"" line to the target seems harder than it should. I really wish the full circle would light green so it would be easier to track. The coaches are fine I don't hate any of their personalities. They're on par with your a typical fitness video instructor. I can't see myself favoring or disliking any of them as they don't have much personality to like or dislike, which is not necessarily a bad thing. 

Really what you're paying for is the music licensing. I do like the music choice. I personally don't care for the fact that supernatural doesn't allow you to cherry pick individual songs, but some users do. This workout program does give you that option, so I can see that being something that users will appreciate on a base level. However for me, Given that this has no lower body workout and I can't seem to get my heart rate up or even break a sweat using this game, I won't be subscribing. It needs a lot of work to be worth the monthly subscription fee they are asking. I'd contemplate a one time fee as I can see myself treating this like a beatsaber ish rhythm game, but I don't know that this will ever make it to an actual workout status for me."

The subscription price is quite high though at just over £15gbp per month.

But, I’m guessing that’s to pay the music license fees.

If, by some chance you need to pause the game mid class, it’s gonna be hit and miss as to whether the app continues to play or not. This has happened quite a few times in the last two days - I even paused it on purpose a few times just to test it out.

Is it worth the money to continue after this 7 day trial?

Probably not. It’s just lacking something to keep me going past the initial few rounds."

1434,Michelle Ocasio,"Mar 6, 2022 at 3:59 AM",2,Boring,"I'm writing this review from the point of view of someone who needs to lose over 100lbs. I wrote a similar review for Les Mills Body Combat (which I really like).

Just from watching the promo video from this game I had a few questions that would help me decide if I would keep it:

Are there legs involved or is it just punching?  There were no legs involved... did I just not play the game long enough? When first turned it on, it gives you an option to either ""login"" or ""try it out."" I tried it out but it seems like I didn't get the full experience. The trainers appear in the form of a rectangular TV screen to the left of the punching device. The trainer demonstrates on an actual physical device while you punch the VR device. I will say though if you are interested in boxing for real, learning good form, then this is the game for you.

I know I'm a poor player, will it demotivate me? It didn't demotivate me because I did poorly, it demotivated me because it was just plain boring. It didn't hype me up like Supernatural, Body Combat or FitXR. Nothing coming at you, no interesting background, no glitz.  Even Druken Bar Fight has more character and gives a better workout.

Can I play against people I know? No, and this is unfair. Since about January I have been reading that this game was multiplayer and that you could play against friends, but just a few days before the game came out the description was changed to single player.

Is it too hard? Are there different levels?  Each song has three different levels: easy, medium and hard. I did not find the easy level difficult at all.

Is there diversity in the trainers? No. 

Can I play on the original Oculus Quest (1)? Yes.

What is the music like? Only a couple of songs appeared for me, the rest were blank squares that said the words ""Song"" and ""Artist"" underneath them. I worked out to Bon Jovi's Living on a Prayer. Someone in another review mentioned that music wasn't important, but it is wholly important to me. I need good music for a good workout.

Would I pay $18.99 a month? Not a chance."
1435,Sad3LuV,"Mar 16, 2022 at 6:55 PM",1,Not even worth the free trial,If 0 stars were an option i would take it. From the into of the man talking didn’t cut it for me. I pay yearly for supernatural and i love it and in comparison it’s 0 i tried it because i love boxing on supernatural and thought this would be the same or close to and i was wrong it’s not even close to it ! I got a headache from it being so far up and i understand the concept but the end results failed. I did it for 2 days and cancelled the trial because i knew i wasn’t going to buy it and didn’t want to forget it. My advice is pass

Then the app forces you to watch this guy give you an intro every single time you log in. Super annoying. Once you actually get into the app it’s pretty fun. They could use a better selection of songs. It’s mostly pop. Needs more rock and rap. The lights are not always perfectly on beat, but pretty close."

1443,davi,"Mar 5, 2022 at 12:18 PM",2,Eh. Can Supernatural add this concept,"Initial review

Liteboxer is everything I wanted from a boxing app. I only did a quick 15 min workout and didn't really get a chance to explore more. But based on the little I did. This is what I wanted from FitXR for a long time. Basically, there is a coach next to you on camera and they are boxing with you and guiding you. However, you aren't just throwing punches to a beat. You are doing real boxing combinations and building on the combinations throughout the song. I am struggling with the uppercuts but overall a decent app. However, I am not sure it's worth having a separate app for or another subscription. I wish that FitXR and now Supernatural would add something like this to their already made apps. Just my opinion. I am not sure the level I did was pretty easy. More like a warm-up, but I do think I saw something about harder workout levels.

Came back for more 

I decided to give Liteboxer another try. Unfortunately I crashed on it mid workout. Once again. I think this app is cool. But not worth it as a separate app. Here they have single tracks and workouts. You can pick what songs you want to workout to. This was pretty cool. It would be cooler if they allowed you to pick multiple songs and play those as one long workout. Like you're making your own workout playlist. 

Something I didn't really like were the hooks. They count off by numbers. 3 and 4 are left and right hook but here it just felt like more jabs and crosses. I get the 'equipment' we are using this is how they do it. I would rather do traditional hooks like other boxing apps. The upper cuts were also a bit hard when I had those. I'm sure it feels better on the real thing though. To be honest, I would have preferred a virtual boxing bag like the one in Thrill of the Fight or Creed. 

I'm also used to having the punches come towards me. So even though I know the punches it was confusing my brain a bit with the lights flashing up. But I'm sure you can get used to it over time. 

I'm mad the game crashed on me. Since I have a free week trial I keep at it. But after my game crashed, I went and did Supernatural for an hour.

I don't believe that I will keep this app. However, there are some good things that I listed that I think other workout apps can take away from this one and add it to there's to enhance the over all boxing experience."
1444,Celia,"Mar 8, 2022 at 3:47 PM",5,Great fun!,"I am surprised at the negative review, I find it a fun and simple to follow boxing session, almost like drumming to the music on a drum pad. I use it as a warm up before a workout."
1445,Dylan Wilson,"Apr 7, 2022 at 5:03 AM",2,Love the App BUT....,"This app is cool, has a guitar hero vibe for sure. I think you need to go tona single purchase with song packs because currently this app just cant compete against the supernatural app. If im going to pay a monthly fee of $18 i might as well go with supernatural. It has more than boxing and the visuals and workouts are better designed. 
If you swap to a single purchase i will buy this game for sure."

I decided to bite the bullet for one month as I loved the music selection and the simplicity of the game. The more tracking needed, the more glitchy games tend to be and with limited movement, there's really no glitchiness to speak of. However, the filtering system is abysmal. You have to select a filter for each round, the filter doesn't remain. Also, there should be some way to sort, search, make a playlist. I also haven't seen songs added and I don't know, I expect more, A LOT more if I'm paying monthly. As a standalone game, this would have been great. As a subscription, it just doesn't cut the mustard."
