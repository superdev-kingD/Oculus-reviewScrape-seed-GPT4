0,Mary-Antoinette,Mar 2 at 3:33 AM,5,My sincere gratitude...,"I've been doing Supernatural workouts for 2 months, but I'm glad I waited until today to leave a review because it was during my workout today that I started crying tears of joy when I realized that I found myself again. 
All the way into my early 30s, I was in pretty good shape. And they tell you to make healthy choices and stay active while you're young because your age will catch up with your health. I didn't listen, and as my metabolism slowed, I gained weight. My poor mental and physical health depleted me of energy, and I used food and alcohol as a way to cope. 
Then Covid happened, and I gained more weight...and then, just over a year ago, Covid took my mother. For an entire year, I went through a mid-life/existential crisis. From age 32 - 42, I went from 118 pounds to 195 pounds (I gained 40 of those pounds in the last 2 years).
But today, during my workout, I realized that something had shifted in my brain. Over the past 2 months, I slowly started feeling stronger, healthier, more energetic, more motivated...happier...hopeful. I also found that I didn't just create a habit; I created an addiction. I look forward to my Supernatural workouts every day. My workouts have increased to 2 hours a day, and it's still not enough. 
I just want to thank the creators of Supernatural, and especially, the coaches. Leanne, Coach Doc, Dwana, Mark, Raneir, Mindy...from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much for the motivation and support. I just can't say enough about how this app has turned my life around."
1,Pwoog,Jan 26 at 12:01 AM,5,One of the best Investments in my health,"My story should be put into a commercial for Supernatural and Oculus Fitness in general.

I am a 62 year old male who has lost 30 pounds in the last 4 - 6 months using virtual reality fitness on the Quest.  I started with Beat Saber then graduated to BoxVR ( now FitVR) but have now found Supernatural.  I have no complaints about the other experiences; other than they are not Supernatural.  The experience combined with the intensity of the workout is what puts Supernatural at the top.  

I have a home gym with enough machines to embarrass some small gyms.  I am an avid golfer and would find excuses to not use my treadmill, my recumbent or my Helix machine for my cardio exercise because it was tedious and boring.  Supernatural will kick your behind but you have “FUN” doing it."
2,Rob,Mar 8 at 9:00 PM,5,Great workout...but....,I am 60 and love the workouts......trying to find music that doesn't make me want to pull eardrums out can get difficult at times.  Please get more music and not so much of today's hiphop/rap/bad rock....Every night I open it and PRAY that the new ones shown of the left are ANYTHING I would do.  1/3 decent/great music is better than ZERO though!!!!  Older punk/New wave/classic rock/older metal please!!  LOVE IT!!
3,Nosnivel,Mar 17 at 8:36 AM,1,Thieves,"I have not used this app in well over a year.  I only used it a few times and it frankly was not that good. 

Sometimes when iogged in to Meta and had to make the transition from Oculus to Meta I looked for Supernatural to ensure it would not renew .

It was  not listed in my apps and further I  was assured this would not renew, that there was no record. When it was close to the year I confirmed that. 

I have been charged an annual renewal regardless and nobody wants to help. 

There are better free or less expensive exercise programs. 

I would suggest Beat Saber for one and Ragnarok as another."
4,Will Steele,6 days ago,1,Getting stagnant an non innovative,"In addition to removing MRC tool support, the app has become quite boring.  Yes, they have new workout playlists every week, but it is missing so many obvious features.  When inquiring about mixed reality capture on their facebook group I got a response from dozens of fanatics trying to tell me that recording my workouts is against Supernatural terms of service.  It's not.  Then my facbook account was suspended from posting to their group. This is after forking over $20/month for nearly 2 years. They've been aquired by facebook.  I don't think they care about improving or being innovative.  Heck, they couldn't even manage to get their payment authorization system to properly automatically bill me multiple times resulting in me not being able to log in.  There is so much that could be done better, but maybe I'll just do that myself and build a better app."
5,Zacourdc1,Mar 18 at 10:22 PM,5,The reviews are all spot on…,"I bought the oculus quest for my boyfriend who is a golf fanatic (so I thought golf+ would be great for him). I decided to one day try it and looked at the App Store and came across this app. I didn’t think much of it but decided to try the 7 day trial. 
It has been 8 days and I have been in the game every day on my lunch break (1 hr) and an hour after dinner. 

I am obsessed with the flow workouts! It gets my heartbeat up, sweat flowing, and me cheesing and laughing at some of the instructors’ jokes. 

I’ve tried some of coach Doc’s meditations and they are so good. 

The scenery, the music, the movements… I just love it. Best investment. Please continue with the Disney hits!!  They are my absolute favorite."
6,Ali Terrana,6 days ago,5,Addicting Fitness App,"Supernatural is extremely addicting. It is not only an amazing full body workout, it is also a blast! I started in Jan 23, I about to hit a 12 week streak. I have lost 20 lbs by using Supernatural and dieting. I enjoy the constant challenge, mix of 
music and choices available. The app is great and the option to choose higher intensities as you get stronger keeps you honest! I have also learned that when you update your app on the headset, it evaluates your progress and makes it harder to reach higher accuracies. I like their accessories and clothing as well."
7,Mara Jade,Dec 27 at 7:04 AM,5,Finally getting fit!,"We both have Quest2s and asked my boyfriend to download the demo to help me decide if I wanted to ""try it out for a month or two"" to kick start done exercising.  That was 6 months ago and we both have memberships now. I saw all the ads and that it was a monthly fee so I wanted not to like it, but it quickly won me over. It's cheaper than a gym and I've used it more than any gym membership I've ever had! The two main exercises, boxing and flow, are both fun and challenging in different ways and both give a good workout.  I assumed I could start at the medium level- less than a minute in I realized that was a nope! The ability to chain different workouts is different levels and times together really let's you get whatever you want out of it each time.  Like all the reviews say, the huge variety of licensed music is a big plus, but what really makes this app shine are the trainers.  I thought I wouldn't want relentlessly upbeat, fit people shouting encouragement at me, but I was wrong about that too! I love them all and sometimes find myself muttering ""thank you"" to a trainer at the end of a session thought they can't hear you."
8,Lianne,8 days ago,5,Chosing Songs,"I love this program! I have a ripped achilles and a torn ACL so Mobility is hard but with Supernatural I can keep my feet fairly planted and still get an amazing workout!!!

I do have one question. Can we select the songs we want to workout to? So have a list and let us choose the songs and then click go? Just asking if a Personal Play List can be an option?

Thanks 
Li


Part 2
I know that the choreo and coaching is months in planning and such but each time you finish a workout it says let's go to the next and then the scene changes, etc. I'm wondering if within the songs already in the program...one can choose the ones you like? Not just any song :)"
9,Brianne,12 days ago,5,What’s not to love?!,"I’ve had Supernatural for about a month and love it. The coaches are uplifting and motivational (s/o to Coach Leanne!!), the workouts are a fun, upbeat experience in my weekly workout mix and the music is…chef’s kiss!! I’ll gladly pay the monthly subscription fee for the talent of the coaches and the sweet tunes. Keep up the great work, Supernatural team!!"
10,Regina Lynn,17 days ago,5,The reason I have a Quest,"Supernatural is an incredible fitness program and community. I love the choreography, the coaching, the music, the environments, and the vast variety of workouts available. The workouts are so adaptable to most bodies and fitness levels, whether you are already active or getting back to movement or starting for the first time. You can work out seated; use one-controller mode; calibrate to your own height and reach; and other modifications as needed. Supernatural keeps getting even better and offering more. Highly recommended."
11,Joe Kastendieck,Jan 28 at 6:36 PM,5,Really well-made fitness app,"First off, let’s address the main hang-up people have - the subscription model. This app is around $230 a year (CND, USD is $180). That’s a lot of money. But for me, this is my main source of exercise, which I use about 3-4 times a week for 30 minutes a session, so it’s worth it. I also use my work’s wellness spending account to cover my membership fee, so that makes it pretty easy to swallow.

Cost aside, it’s a great workout - I’m often out of breath and literally dripping sweat by the end. As someone who isn’t super coordinated when it comes to dancing, I find the mapping of targets in the flow workouts to be super helpful in making me move to music I like in a way that feels graceful, powerful and in-time (although how it looks outside the headset may be a different story). And the boxing is just excellent - who wouldn’t like to punch things and dodge to an epic soundtrack? I’ve never really been overweight, but I still leaned up and lost around 13lbs since starting Supernatural a year ago. My cardio stamina has noticeably improved.

I think that’s another thing - I’ve been regularly working out for a year with minimal lapses. That’s a huge win for my health, and I don’t even need to leave my house. The app keeps things fresh by adding new workouts daily. That helps a lot. Yes, there are common songs that are recycled, but new ones are added regularly as well. No, you can’t choose the songs to make a custom workout, but the devs have added the option to select a workout by searching by artist. Nice touch. Also, I have added new songs to my liked list on Spotify because I’ve discovered some new music on Supernatural. 

The natural environments you do workouts in are top-notch. They keep adding more, and they’ve become better with time. I really enjoy the “moment” meditations that let you just sit in the environments for ten minutes.

The coaches are good. If you get annoyed with them and just want to be “in the zone” with no interruptions, a new “focus mode” has been added to the in-workout menu, enabling you to mute the coaches for everything except the warm up and cooldown. I use it once in awhile (maybe once every 4-5 workouts), but I’ve found that along with their cheesy jokes, the tips for movement and form from the coaches are actually pretty good and help me take stock of if I’m stiffening up, not breathing or not extending enough. I tend to leave the coaches on unless I find the dialogue too distracting. Each coach brings their own personality and I appreciate that they record a new segment for each new workout. 

Overall, this is a feature-rich, well-developed workout app that will kick your butt if you’re fully into it. It stays fresh, and the devs keep trying to make it better. The workout stats are really nice, and the new “search by artist” feature is great too. I could do without the new “congrats” cutscene when I hit my weekly goal, the sparkly check marks and “success” sound were enough for me. Yes, this app is expensive, but it is the app that gets the most hours of use on my Quest, and it’s improved my quality of life. I’d say that’s worth $230. Especially when my benefits are paying for it!"
12,Beefy,Jan 14 at 5:12 AM,5,This App Changed Me Fr Fr,Came thru this thang like a sceptic; sucking my teeth at every possibility of spending my hard earned clams on some goofy ahh monthly subscription app. Come to find ya boy is now madly in love with all the coaches and calls himself Shareef Monster on the super natural social app because I’m loyal like that. Download this app if you have a dream of ending racism. Avoid this app if you’re rude to waiters.
13,Gini,20 days ago,5,Since the beginning....,"I've become a deprived Junkie to this since my work schedule has changed ...2 devices, 4 avatars, and a dozen email accounts I had to create for integration of family life/device ,(etc)...and the Bluetooth/web ""entities"".. correcting our mistakes...systematically.  Even when having issues . .they were supportive ...yet systematic along with the system that was faster at consolidations my name/email address to pay ent method...however not forgiving if descrepancies got cross checked in the beginning and  at least..only charged once per payment method per month ..their usage issues have subsided  more quickly than many other service app s who shall remain nameless at this time. IT IS THE ONLY RECURRING PAYMENT I HAVE...AGAINST MY BANK ACCOUNT. PERIOD.  Anyone else gots a one time shot each time. Not to mention ...a self proclaimed Supernatural ""junkie""...since they started..  and still am .. deprived for time recently...but at least it's there when I have a chunk of time...or make one..late or early. Depending on your schedule ..before or after...in mine."
14,La Toya Rucker,21 days ago,5,I absolutely love it,Awesome... Just awesome.  It's a great daily habit it start and keep going.  I've learned I'm tougher than I thought.  I look forward to working out because of this.  I can even take frustrations out with the boxing and even with the flow but I have to remember to use the wrist straps to my controllers won't fly  out of my hands lol
15,Dianne Packard,22 days ago,5,Love Supernatural,"Researched Supernatural before getting my Meta Quest 2, it looked like pure fun!  
Not only is it fun, it is challenging and gives a great work out.  I encourage everyone I meet to buy it. 
I am by no means perfectly in shape.. 51 slightly over weight, but still decently fit... and these sets make me sweat!  I feel like i am playing a game and am not focused on ""working out""  I will finish one Flow session and then jump into a boxing one.  I thought boxing... Not for me!  But again, its a lot of fun and an awesome work out  while your play this game!
Each session starts and ends with gentle stretching. Coaches constantly encourage you , throughout.  
I also tried the stretching... and again its easy, and options are provided for those not as flexible.
Overall after a solid week of using it about 20 to 30 min a day,  I have less pain, Im already noticing a difference in my muscles, Im more flexible and Im sleeping better... although Im pretty sure that from just working it hard!! 

My advice to you?  BUY IT!! You wont regret it!"
16,Eggs Erroneous,12 hours ago,4,Tried it and liked it,"I started a free trial promotional to work out 5 minutes 5 days out of 7 and receive free controller grips. I did the goal and eventually ordered and received the grips ( good quality grips). I did not cancel the free trial in time and was charged the monthly fee. When you sign up for the free trial if you choose annual plan then you get 14 day trial, but if you choose  monthly you only get 7 day free trial. My fault for not reading the fine print. 

I used this app for 1 month and I was pretty much satisfied with the workout and entertainment. I can understand why this app is not free, there is a lot content of coaches and songs that inspire and move you along. I was getting a good workout using the boxing and paddle swatting. As is life though I cannot afford the monthly fee to continue, but I may join back in some time in the future."
17,Audrey,22 days ago,5,My favorite way to workout,"I started over a month ago, and now I play this game every day. It's the best workout! I love the high intensity boxing workouts the best because it keeps my heart rate high and burns the most calories.  About 500 cal an hr. I just wish the supernatural app would accept galaxy watch for tracking,  I just use my other apps to track it but it would help. Sometimes I use 2lb hand weights on the low to medium boxing workouts, if you try it it will seriously make your arms burn within a few songs. I have to take them off after a few songs . Thank you"
18,Wendy,3 days ago,2,Unhelpful customer service,"I’ve been using supernatural almost daily since January 2022 and was one of their biggest cheerleaders.  Prior to mid March 2023, I would have rated this program over five stars. However, after an update in mid-March, I started having problems with the program. I sent numerous emails and examples to Supernatural support and was routinely dismissed that there were no problems or it may be hardware issues.  Nope.  Hardware is just fine. I continue to play Supernatural because I like the program and the movement but my heart isn’t in it like it was.  All because of the lack of customer service and willingness to acknowledge that there is an issue and a fix."
19,Maajfic,3 days ago,1,Very disappointed,"The last time I have been on this game was a month ago, now here is the problem this game has took 190 dollars from my literal card. The bank called and told me that a game on oculous called supernatural took 190 dollars from my card without me putting my card in the game or anything this is so disappointing taking money from a card without someone putting it in or anything else. I did not purchase anything I thought this was free wow fix this game."
20,Lbn,Mar 17 at 8:52 PM,5,Unparalleled,"This app has reinvigorated my love of fitness and my workout regimen, I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking to get fit. The coaches and the workouts put you in the right headspace to feel empowered, and the workouts, music, and visual effects all motivate you to reach your goals. It helps with battling depression, anxiety, and self doubt.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!

🔥🔥🔥"
21,Matza,Mar 1 at 7:27 PM,5,"Captivating, Attainable, Challenging","Ive tried gyms, classes, home workouts, walking, running...so many things over the years, and always became bored or didnt like getting dressed to go in public to sweat. This ""game"" is amazing! I work out harder and longer because of the joy and excitement in the workouts. So many ways to change it up.  
I had stopped working out for the past year, im in my 50's. Had started getting a sore shoulder... was getting steroid shots. Now i dont need them. 
Did I mention... NOT boring!!"
22,Lelalu,Feb 6 at 9:11 PM,1,Boo,"Nice app if you are rich and like burning money.  I have since found Les Mills Body camp and it is so much better!  The coaches are better and you pay one fee to purchase, no monthly fees or yearly (gym) fees! Laughable.  It's a game not a gym and the coaches aren't real much less there in person, what a rip off."
23,Kierjo,25 days ago,5,Great workout But !!!!!!,"I was looking for some type of leader board and not one between just friends 😂 LOL but yet to find it. Or maybe it’s gone because it’s an everyone gets a trophy kind of world now. 

It would be nice to have that extra push like I find on other workout platforms on here, and nothing wrong with that. I think it’s great trying to push and beat others like a game. 

But all in all this is a Great workout platform, so if you’re on the fence I’d go for it and get in the workout. It’s definitely worth the small price for your health. Try for a month you will be hooked. 

And sorry about the rant on the world going soft but I think there’s room for improvement in a few areas. Put a leader board back😊😂"
24,Jessica Cougle,Mar 11 at 8:05 PM,5,Totally addicted!!!,"I bought VR 2 weeks ago and I have played it everyday since I bought it. Supernatural is one of the first apps I downloaded and man…I have never felt better! I’m 45 yrs old and feel stronger and more energetic since I started working out with Supernatural! I love the trainers, the works outs and the music.  Will update my review again in a few weeks!"
25,persephone,Mar 11 at 1:08 PM,5,Amazing!,"You would think that this is like Beat Saber, but it's not, at all. Even if you don't listen to the great trainers that help you and push you to keep going, It's still a major workout! I've never sweat so much doing an exercise video, and I started decades ago with the Wii. 🤣 
This is amazing! The music you can choose and the trainers in the background helping you to keep going, and the different levels and... and... and.... This is worth every penny you'd spend on it!! I hate excersizing but this is the most fun I've ever had and I'd recommend it to anyone!"
26,amanda lynn beck,12 days ago,3,Bad music,"I like the concept- play it all the time but this workout is expensive for a year! more than my planet fitness membership and I have a black card..
So forgive me when I say the music is terrible... one or 2 good songs- 2 or 3 good workouts but where's the great music we all love so dear.. I'm disappointed so I'm only giving it 3 stars.. I feel violated"
27,Carly,Feb 23 at 9:33 AM,5,AWESOME!!!!,I almost didn’t get it because so many compared it to Beat Saber which was free with my Quest 2….No Way!!! The two are nothing alike. I just started and can make it through just two songs then I need a break. My goal for next week is to make it to four songs. This is such a great workout and workout every part of your body. I am so in love with this and won’t need any other game. Excited for the journey. If you were like me and got a Quest for working out then you will love this!!!
28,Jordan,Dec 30 at 4:13 AM,2,Too pricey - It’s not a gym membership!,"I used Supernatural on a trial basis. I enjoyed it for the most part. I am glad to hear they now allow for the ability to mute the coaches for those who prefer that.

It is a shame because I - and I suspect lots of others agree - would happily pay for this app if it were a reasonable cost. They want to compare themselves to a gym membership… but they lack so much of what you get with a gym membership. I don’t understand how they can justify asking for nearly $200 per year. If they ever decide to price themselves appropriately, I’ll happily sign up!"
29,Sutpen,14 days ago,1,Supernatural steals money,Just discovered charges on my credit card for two months of Supernatural that I didn’t sign up for long after I cancelled my subscription.  Will be contacting Visa immediately. Beware. This company will scam you.
30,Molly,15 days ago,3,Room for Improvement But Still Fun,"So, this is one of the better fitness programs however there is always room for improvement. My issues in no particular order:

1. The “Power” rating makes absolutely no sense nor does their explanation of how it is measured. The title should be changed or a logical explanation provided.
2. You can’t turn off the coach’s instruction which is annoying especially since a couple of them have voices that are like nails on a chalk board to my sensitive ears. You can turn them down but should be able to just listen to the music and work out if you want 
3. The constant use of the word “Fam” “Family” and “Athlete” by the coaches. I get that you are trying to motivate and create a sense of community but it is annoying 
4. There isn’t lots of new content. I have  been doing the same workouts for several weeks in the hard flow levels?
5. In some of the hard and pro levels it seems like you are just flailing your arms and is this really good just to be able to hit the targets and some seem impossible to hit like white balls on both your left and right side at the same time. Make it challenging by constant movement but don’t make it so you look like one of those long arm waving guys at the car dealerships . I have seem similar comments and it appears like it could be dangerous in a way since it is such a jerky movement that could result in injury?
Just my two cents. I hope they always keep improving because if not it may get too boring and repetitive"
31,Funnyuser,4 days ago,5,Finally! Fitness you crave,"I’ve tried every exercise/fitness program out there, but finally found something I love that makes me look forward to working out!"
32,AveryChase,Jan 7 at 6:54 PM,5,"Lost weight, in shape, had FUN!","I have enjoyed spending the last year punching, hitting, and now kneeing my way to an improved self. With the encouragement of the coaches and wonderful song choices my body has transformed from the challenging movement sequences. My family is now joining me after seeing the transformation in mind, spirit, and body.  Thank you Supernatural!!!"
33,Ido_Oculusquest,Mar 5 at 8:02 PM,5,Needed this in my life,"I started the free trial 2 months ago not expecting much. It was inching closer to the end of the trial and I noticed how much fun I was having and had a nice sweat too. I’m now a satisfied subscriber of Supernatural. 

I’ve lost a significant amount of weight, gained more confidence, and actually unequivocally ￼enjoy working out all while being in the comfort of my own home. 

Thank you Supernatural team for keeping me motivated and having so much fun. You guys rock!"
34,Gmo88,Mar 18 at 8:22 AM,5,Thank you,I have cystic fibrosis and I am really self-conscious so i don't go to the gym because i get stares  and get anxiety because i have to use oxygen. But now i can work out at home ND feel like I'm not alone makes working out extremely fun
35,CJ,Mar 4 at 8:06 PM,5,Worth every penny,"Joined 15 months ago- still going strong - minus 40 lbs! I’ve never had a fitness routine I stuck with this long. What started as a free trial, has become almost a daily routine. It doesn’t get stale, as there are new workout’s introduced daily, and an active Facebook community full of support and encouragement- from all shapes, sizes and fitness levels. The coaches are real people who often engage personally with the community. The workouts are always changing- with new choreo and music that keeps the experience fresh and exciting. And there’s something for everyone - with different level workouts and modifiers - you can really find what works for you and scale up when you’re ready. I would definitely recommend taking advantage of the free trial- I’m so glad I did!"
36,Davina,Mar 8 at 6:50 PM,5,Love this one!,"I have tried a few of the fitness apps on here and have previously picked a favorite.  I originally was staying away from supernatural because of the reoccurring cost. However, I wanted to switch up what I was doing so decided to do the free trial and then cancel lol. Oh my goodness I have found a new favorite!!  So many of these fitness ones are very repetitive, but not 
supernatural!  No 2 moves are the same. I did my first workout and had no clue how much it kicked my butt until the next morning when my legs realized what an amazing workout I actually did!!"
37,CHELLBELLE,Mar 4 at 6:37 PM,5,Super! And Natural!,Supernatural is my favorite workout App. It combines super routines with natural scenery. I absolutely enjoy it 😊.  It's for ANYONE who is willing to use it. It's easy to learn and provides much needed variety. Mind and body is my all time favorite series. It combines meditation 🧘‍♀️ with exercise. Thank you Supernatural!
38,Mae Swisher,18 days ago,3,Great game…. But the same playlist,I’ve been playing the game for almost 8 months now. Been around the app checked out the different styles of music. But you guys seem to give us the same songs EVERY day. And when we do get something new their more rock based or pop based. I loved seeing R&B on the list of songs I could play. And would love to see more diversity as such. SO PLEASE GIVE US WHAT WE WANT
39,Olender,20 days ago,4,Wow,"Lost some kg🤪! I have narcolepsy and Moving help me stay awake especially in the morning which are the most difficult to manage. !!! Why 4 not 5 I think the stretching programs are to short . I know it’s VR , however  you can do  different levels stretching with longer time. It could help us to get back on our feet ….
It was the best money I spent 
Also can we , like only connect with others, boxing program competition ect . ? Just 💡 the idea"
40,NickiNRB,Jan 22 at 2:26 AM,5,SUPERNATURAL - Best workout app,"I honestly cancelled my gym membership because I was using this app more!  I like working out before going to work early in the morning  before the sun comes up. The  music and especially with Coach RANEIR POLLARD,  that one…. and his energy, his “Full Body”and his other workouts gets me pumped !!   I’m seeing results and having fun working out to the music. Best workout App on Oculus by far, best workout app PERIOD, believe that!  It’s definitely worth the yearly price, basically $15 a month for hundreds of workouts. My gym membership cost way more than that."
41,WandaPR,20 days ago,5,Loving it 💪🏻,"I love it and am seeing results but it would be nice to do the workouts offline too.  and I hope you guys add more music like Prince, Cyndi Lauper, Tina turner and in that line. Keep it up!"
42,zar,19 days ago,4,Fun game,"Ive tried this, Supernatural, Powerbeats, Les Mills, so I'll compare them below. I've seen many people mentioning Beat Saber and Synth Riders games in these reviews which isn't relevant because these two games are very mild forms of exercise. However I'll be recommending more game-like exercise apps at the bottom.

Supernatural: fun and intensive. Class options are flow (the standard slash, tilt and duck movements) and boxing. Many mainstream music options (Ariana Grande, the Weeknd, etc) which most apps dont have. Personally the music to me wasnt the empowering feel but more so popular radio hits, but this is a personal preference as to how you want to feel. Multiple coaches available. You do not have choice over environment and the options are limited but the ones they do includef are beautiful nature based. It does have meditation too which is cool though i tried one meditation and it was uneffective and the speaker didnt seem experienced, but not what i tried the app for anyways so doesnt really matter. $19 a month is insane so I'll never buy this after the trial.  Full body workout.
Overall pros: fun game, good exercise, motivating coaches
Cons: expensive, music not as empowering, environment, less variety compared to FitXR

Powerbeats: worst VR exercise game right now. Bored after just playing one level but gave it a chance by trying a few. Mostly just consists of swatting balls out the way, no kind of coaching, poor music options, poor environment options,  customizable yes but a good app should have adequate base options too. MAYBE the game gets more fun as you unlock more levels (you have to start out beginner) but every other app already has everything unlocked and ready. Overrated on Meta Quest app but appropriately rated on Youtube. light intensity.
Pros: customizable
Cons: music, environment, gameplay

FitXR: BEST OVERALL. The app with the most amount of various class-types and one of the only fitness apps that let's you have full choice over your environment options and having many choices to choose from (though I hope they'll add a nature based one!) You can use filters to choose the genre of music (different classes have different genres assigned), length of exercise, type of class, the difficulty and it'll show you the options. Many types of exercise such as boxing, dance, HIIT, combat etc. I do wish they had kicking function in the combat. Multitude of coaches available (some classes show the actual coach, some show a kind of cartoon like version of them which can. look kinda weird). Fun and empowering. Full body workout.
Pros: empowering music, fun, good exercise, variety, environment choices
Cons: could use 1 or 2 more functions in combat

Les Mills: this is fun and I like the (pre determined) music which changes based on the class you choose. The class options all have similar structures. I like the knee-hits, I haven't seen any other exercise game have that move yet. There are environment options such as city, space etc though it doesn't change your whole environment, just the sides. Your front environment always remains the same (a studio-like room). This app feels more boxing focused besides the knee hits even though it is advertised as combat. However this is the app I'd recommend if you DONT want to pay for a subscription since it is FAR superior to  Powerbeats. Full body workout though more focus on upper body.
Pros: fun, good exercise, knee-hit option, empowering music
Cons: environment visibility, variety

RHYTHM EXERCISE GAMES RECOMMENDATIONS (no coaching or classes):

Audio trip: though this is more marketed as a rhythm game because there's no gym feel (no coaching or types of classes) instead  you just choose the song you want and change the settings based on the intensity..  it is a great full body workout that can be just as demanding, if not more than all the other apps ive mentioned. GREAT workout. I do like the existing music options but they are quite limited and the DEVs rarely update it. There are no environment change options (though they provide really cool, neon or futiristic pre determined ones).  If you want lots of exercise and really want to feel the beat, I'd recommend this. I use this and fitXr together.
Pro: fun, good exercise
Cons: music and environment variety

Pistol Whip: this game is very intensive and difficult even on the easy setting. It's super fun and makes you feel really cool because you shoot and move to the beat of the music. Like Audio Trip, this game won't give you a gym feel/doesn't have any coaching or sense of classes but will build your endurance immensely! The songs are associated with the Level so you can choose what sounds good before playing that one, though no separate music choices. 
Pros: fun, good exercise, unique music
Cons: will take a lot of tries to get a good score"
43,Rogmocrypta,Jan 4 at 2:00 AM,1,Fun but insane price model. Update!,"The workouts are fun, the scenery is pretty, but the core of the game is fitness. This game popped up early and set a strong foundation for other workout apps but its pricing and what is offers is outdated when its competitors offer a flat rate one time purchase. My low review is solely due to the price. If I could even pay $150 once, I might consider this a high star game. Perhaps a free mode, or flat cost base game and charge more for songs sort of like the Switch Dancing game?

I really do like the coaches and the music, but this costs more than my local Skype session into an actual boxing class in CA, US. What is the subscription purchasing for me? It is unclear.

Update response to Dev: What part of this requires daily updates from the trainers? Are you simply recording them saying ""have a good [insert next holiday]""? Are you saying none of the workouts are recycled? Why can't we just buy a single workout and keep playing it? Or a set of workouts? Why are the other workout apps on the store playing licensed music and not charging the same monthly price? Clearly the devs are fine with the amount of money they are getting or they would update.

Another side question: I noticed the songs are bleeped out for some words. Do you expect children to be paying this price for a workout game? Or are we censoring for adults? Maybe a toggle option would be appreciated. Updated to one star for lame duck response. Additionally I tried missing the punches more and found the game is extremely generous with what it counts as a hit (compared to other workout apps)."
44,VL Proulx,19 days ago,1,Very poor ability to unsuscribe,Can load full app and choose any workout but when trying to unsuscribe the page page does not load and asks for a restart. Same thing over and over. Have paid for three months with no use. Will be cancelling credit card soon due to the difficulty to unsuscribe.
45,Michelle Wilson,Mar 18 at 10:31 PM,3,Why can't I share it with my family?,"I loved this app so much that I bought a second headset so my husband and I could work out in separate rooms (at the same time) because we were working out for an hour every day and our whole evening was shot. It was great that we were both working out but we wanted to see each other too.  However, we can't use two headsets with this app. It's really frustrating."
46,Sofia,Mar 18 at 1:11 AM,4,Love it! Much better than gym membership,"I’m enjoying Supernatural for over half a year now, and I simply love it. I exercise more regularly than I ever did. I like it that I can choose the right time to do it and I can stop whenever I want. The opportunity to get out of the house and into the beautiful scenery without actually doing it is amazing, especially since I often can’t go out IRL. I like the coaches and the updates that allow to use my legs are cool. I would love more different music."
47,Thiswastediousandannoying,Jan 21 at 8:56 AM,5,More than a game,"I started supernatural because I wasn't super familiar with the oculus and it's one of the first options I was shown while shopping around. 

I've had the Oculus for over a year now, and I have yet to pursue another game. I've bought a couple and played a bit, but nothing close to the amount of time I spend on Supernatural. It's become part of my daily routine. 

I look forward to my workouts, and after I'm done I'm not interested in looking for something else to do. The oculus has just become my gym, full stop. 

I've lost weight I didn't intend to, my arms and core have become so toned I hardly recognize my body when I see it. Because I play some stupid game on the reg. 

I sleep better. I feel more optimistic in general. I'm less anxious. Because Supernatural makes getting a workout in both challenging and fun. It's an easy yes to the question of whether or not you have time to workout. You do. And your life is improved in so many ways by that yes. This game makes that yes easy af. 

Agreeing with some of these reviews that the subscription price seems blatantly inflated. But I don't know anything about what it takes to keep something like this running so....idk, just wish it cost less monthly. 

Shout out to coach Doc YOU MUH BOY"
48,AdventureCherie,Mar 2 at 9:58 AM,5,I Actually Exercise With Supernatural!,"I can't tell you how many exercise devices or machines I have purchased that are okay for awhile and then collect dust! This is such a fun, yet challenging way to exercise, I don't even realize how long I've been doing it until my arms or quads start to wobble!"
49,Princesstoo.2022,2 days ago,5,Life changing,"I love, love this workout app. I highly recommend it."
50,Kieran,12 days ago,1,Money-grabbing useless app,"They'll make sure to let you download the app, take your payment information and have you subscribe to their monthly or annual subscriptions BEFORE telling you that it's not available in your country.

The Meta Quest device will remain a poor purchasing decision as long as it has decisions like this. One of the most popular apps on the device can be downloaded by anyone in the world and take your payment information while only remaining playable to people in the USA.

Ridiculous!"
51,Frickfrog,Mar 16 at 4:38 PM,5,Great cardio,30 minutes goes by in a flash. Had to buy a better face mask because I’m drenched in sweat by the time I’m done. ￼ not a game but feels like one. And songs you actually know.
52,Tsumommy,16 days ago,5,I love supernatural.I love Supernatural.,This game has revolutionized my workouts. I play it last as motivation to get the rest of my boring regiment done.
53,Krimsun,Feb 27 at 12:25 PM,1,BS,"After I selected the trial, they didn't let me cancel it OR automatically cancel it after it was over. Not only that, but they charged me for a whole year which is nearly $200. Very clever. OF COURSE they'll charge you for the most expensive package after the trial without asking. They made sure I couldn't cancel so they could charge me for a whole year subscription."
54,Sound in the City,Dec 30 at 11:34 PM,5,Everything you need to know,"So you don’t want to hear the Trainers while you workout? - click the indented button on the Left Controller before the main workout starts, and on the right side of your screen there will be an option for FOCUS MODE; which only gives you the punch sound fx and music, No Trainer Voice. *you can also SKIP Warmups & Cooldowns with that same indented button on the left controller. 

Make sure to adjust your height and workout abilities in the settings. Meaning if you don’t want to duck or squat they tell you in the setup process how to avoid it. 

THE COST!!!!! Yeah it’s pricey. BUT, you tell me another workout game/program that updates the game with NEW MUSIC that you actually want to listen to, and provides new workout playlists at least every other week. 

The community is awesome and supportive. Everyone try’s to encourage each others workouts and you can follow other Supernatural Users and see who’s at the top of your leaderboard every week. 

The game provides lots of Music for all types of audiences. You don’t work out to generic background music, YOU WORK OUT TO SONGS YOU KNOW AND LOVE. There is HipHop/Rap (my favorite), Country, Rock, Classical, Latin, Pop, and some Disney Hits from movies. They have some artist series which has hits from just one artist: Kid Cudi, Lady Gaga, TheWeekend, and others I can’t remember… 

Overall the price is justified for how many playlists and workouts there are, and how much new music they add. They listen to feedback, have great customer service, and you can even request songs for future workouts."
55,CMommy,Nov 24 at 2:10 PM,5,Changing to 5 stars -focus mode +,"When I bought my 1st VR (oculus quest 2) device in January,  I was adamant against any annual subscription apps (aside from my Tripp app that is 20$/yr). I am very particular about what I like to do for daily exercise,  pretty much only boxing. A month ago, I bought Les mills body combat and I absolutely love it! It was a 1x charge of 24$ (sale price). I've been using it every day, but there isn't that much of a selection for daily exercise without doing the same ones over & over... so, with my birthday coming up I figured I would just go ahead and do the free trial figuring it would be my bday gift if I liked it. The cost would be reasonable with the incredible selections of pretty much anything and everything: songs, scenery (graphics), workouts, different levels, meditation, BOXING... if it were a 1 time charge, not an annual subscription.  If it was not a yearly charge, it would've been a no-brainer absolute purchase from the start. It's kind of like paying for an annual gym membership while also having to pay for a piece of the equipment.

Okay, update 5 weeks later... I get it now, totally absolutely obsessed with supernatural. I have done multiple workouts every day since I signed up for the free trial and the workout selections seem endless! I am leaving it at 4 stars to make room for improvements and some of the good ideas and suggestions by other reviewers.

Changed to 5 stars! They just added focus mode & knee lifts... they really do listen to suggestions!"
56,Bastahoobi,Dec 24 at 10:22 PM,5,Fantastic workout game!,"I have been using this almost every day the past few weeks and I highly recommend it.  Really gets you sweating if you get into it and it's actually fun and a workout to look forward to because you can dance around as you go and what not.  
  The subscription price is worth it if you use this.  Better than a gym membership for me because it's convenient and also enjoyable.
  Also, if you are comparing this to Beat saber, this program is WAY better in my opinion.  Not only is it a full body workout, but the song library is SO much better/larger.  That is part of what adds to the cost I think.
  Somebody else complained about not wanting to hear the workout instructor during the workout, so I wanted to mention that if you open the menu after starting a session you can select ""focus mode - on"" and then you will only hear the music (and maybe the sound of when you got the targets).
  Highly recommend if you are looking for a way to workout, especially during the cold months, and dislike things that are not fun."
57,Manny,Mar 1 at 11:09 PM,5,Wow!! Blown Away!,"The workouts will have you sweating bullets! Heart beat racing! Not to mention the music is great and the scenery is breathtaking!! Only drawback is the price. Wish it were cheaper, but overall it’s an amazing experience!"
58,Linda,20 days ago,4,,"Love this workout, love the songs would like more and there is 1 coach that talks to much and its very distracting. Couch encouraging but this 1 randomly talking with little encouragment or i would have given a 5"
59,Aallegra,Mar 4 at 6:22 AM,5,I love this app,"I enjoyed every single day that I put my headset on and use this app. The community is supportive, the music is terrific, the choreography is delightful, and the coaches are wonderful. I cannot say enough. ￼"
60,Rachel,Feb 12 at 10:55 PM,5,,"I'm the type of person who is forced to pay for access to a gym as part of my apartment complex but still won't use it. Supernatural has gotten me to exercise with it consistently about 3 times a week. I've been subscribed for about 6 months and I've noticed a definite improvement in muscles and stamina. I can see myself staying subscribed for years. 

I like how it can be modified to account for what your body can do. I have bad knees, and was able to limit the movements to what I can do. And after months I've noticed a decrease in pain and an increase in my range of motion. 

My main criticism would be that it doesn't have a lot of music that I love. There are only a handful of K-pop songs that they reuse over and over. I find myself reusing the same workouts that have songs that I at least like. I would like to be able to search by genre, not just specific artists, since it has none of the artists I know and like anyways."
61,Toni Boloney,Feb 11 at 5:57 PM,5,Well Done!,I have several apps but this is by far my favorite!! It’s not merely a game it’s a fitness program in disguise 😂. I have never wanted to work out so much in my life. You’ll get hooked on something that is actually good for you. The coaches are empathetic and personable but also push you to succeed. I decided to purchase the yearly subscription and haven’t looked back. There is a sound track and workout level for everyone. You won’t be dissatisfied in this one.
62,Cass,Mar 1 at 7:41 AM,5,Excellent fun short work outs,"I’m obsessed with this. As someone who struggles to find the motivation to work out (or the time), these work outs are short and powerful. The music is awesome. I find myself working out several times a day now because of this app. The people standing in front of you talking and the graphics are amazing. The meditations are short and helpful. I’m just very impressed."
63,TitanicFam,Mar 4 at 1:57 AM,3,The platforms need to stay still,"I have found a glitch that makes this almost unplayable for me. These things make me sweat very quickly. If I take off the headphones to clear the sweat from my glasses, when I put them on the platform has recentered from where it was when I took them off. To make it worse, The whole game will be laggy and no longer something I can work out with forcing me to restart it and never be able to finish a workout."
64,Cheryl,Jan 17 at 5:02 AM,5,Loving this app!,"I’ve used another fitness app on a video game to start, and found that I loved the medium of games to get fit!  I’ve been using the other game for over a year now, so I was ready for something different.  I received the Meta Quest 2 as a gift, and tried my first workout today.  I am absolutely going to LOVE using this on a regular basis!!  Right from the start, I found a workout with songs I adore.  The coaching was helpful and encouraging without being annoying.  The views are breathtaking!  Halfway through the workout, I really started having fun!  I was pleased to end the workout with a great score!  Workouts that are truly “fun” keep me engaged and consistent, so I am very happy to say that this is the case with Supernatural."
65,Mike,Mar 13 at 7:51 AM,2,Careful with free trial,I started free 60day trial an never used it. I forgot it was there. Realized it after 3 payments that say (ATM supernatural) 20.51$ each came out.  It's hard to cancel. You can't do it threw the app or headset. You have to go on the actual website for the game an find setting an go to membership. The game might be great I didn't even try it. It came with my son's oculus as a free trial didn't realize it would cost me so much.
66,Leah,7 days ago,5,Love it,Life changing 💕
67,Kelvin,Jan 25 at 8:13 AM,5,Wow!,"I just wanted to take time to write a review because I read so many reviews of people complaining about the cost etc… let me just say that I’m a former Division 1 basketball player and these workouts are awesome. The Flow workouts especially. They really get the heart rate going. Yeah, it’s not a gym membership, but is $20 per month worth good health? In my opinion you can’t put a cost on good health. So for the price of two trips to McDonald’s, you pay for an app that will get you in shape and healthy. No brainer…."
68,Derek Desrochers,Mar 3 at 12:38 AM,3,I can't keep up.,"I like this game. But... I am 45, trying to lose weight and get back in shape. I don't like to go outside to work out. Crippling social anxiety is I guess what it's called. I was very excited to try this. Unfortunately it's hard for me to keep up with the complexity of the low impact workouts. It is really hard for me to get in any groove when complex and extremely quick combination moves are popping up all the time. Which is sad because when there are those moments when everything slows and I am given easily followed motions and not overburdened with having to concentrate on whatever is coming next, I can dance with it and really move with the motions it wants me to perform. I have a lot of fun at those moments!

What I am trying to say is, please make a beginner level for those of us who aren't young or in better shape. I am on the 7 day trial, but have cancelled to give me more time to consider other options. 

Make it fun for those of us who aren't athletes too! Let us enjoy it as well, please."
69,PowerDwarf,Dec 26 at 11:43 PM,3,"Great WO, stunning, horrible coaches","I enjoy the workouts (when they include both upper and lower body) and it’s a real pleasure to work out in these gorgeous international landscapes. Five stars for that! But the coaches are simply intolerable. Their constant stream of comments range from annoying to  outright infuriating. You can only turn them down to 50% volume, which turns them into creepy whispers! The new “Focus” mode has to be selected for EVERY workout. So annoying- why can’t you just let us mute them??? As much as I love this game, I just can’t take the chirping nonsense. PS - Modern sports medicine knows that the order of operations should be 1) warm up, 2) work out, 3) stretch. Why are you still doing the old-fashioned “stretch before working out?”"
70,kermitis2coolforschool,Jan 24 at 12:02 AM,5,Best workout ever-life changing!,"I haven’t been to the gym in probably 3 years. I haven’t had the desire to go back because well, social anxiety. But I LOVE to workout! And I also LOVE music and dancing! This is everything! I nearly cried when I began working out with supernatural for the first time. This is absolutely life changing for me! You know how sometimes you’re sore from the gym so you decide to take a day off or have an easy walk to recuperate? Yeah, you’re gonna crave your next workout worse than a craving for a chocolate bar!"

74,YoChris916,Jan 18 at 8:57 PM,1,Worst app ever,Did the seven day trial. W￼as not  happy with the app so cancelled it and they ended up charging me $179.99 and now I’m fighting to get my money back I suggest not to buy. I’ve been emailing for the past 4 days and got nothing but the runaround. Very disappointed. And since I signed in and made my account through meta the Supernatural app they cannot help me so now I have to contact Matta to see if they will contact Supernatural to see if I can get my money back running around in circles.
75,Brook,Jan 22 at 9:08 AM,5,Love love love it!,"This is just plain and simply fun and I actually look forward to doing it in my spare time. I have never been able to commit to an exercise regimen or actually use a gym membership because either it just feels like extra work that I have to do that I don’t really “want” to do and I hate the gym because it’s intimidating and have no idea what to actually do with all the equipment. 

I would love for knee strikes to be incorporated into boxing to give it a bit of a MMA feeling and add a bit more lower body component 

Update: found out they have knee strikes in boxing right after I wrote this haha. Tried them and are definitely awesome!"

For that price really not worth to subscribe but at least you get a 7day free trial to know on your own 😋"
77,Marco,Jan 18 at 1:10 AM,2,Not worth it,"The app is pretty basic, nothing special and yet they try to charge you $20 monthly just like a real gym membership. They sure are out of their minds.

I do wish there were better music choices. Calling 90’s music ‘retro’ is an insult to those of us in our 50’s & 60’s! 😄 I was worried that my legs wouldn’t get much of workout. I was WRONG!

Best workouts ive ever done, theyre fun and really work your body i mean the low intensity work out leave me dripping in sweat. Not the mention the settings and different coaches are super cool to and make it not boring to do. I dont know who made this app but you deserve like 10 awards! I actually like working out now!"
82,Tweeterita,11 days ago,4,Love Love Love but..,It does buffer more than any other apps. Gets a little frustrating a times.   Otherwise it is my favourite workout app!
83,Brando,Jan 19 at 8:54 AM,5,,"Update: the new focus mode has indeed made this a 5 star program. That on top of bringing more leg work with both foot work knee hits. 

I would love to give this a 5 star. The songs are a fantastic mix and the workouts can be really intense! It's just the coaches can be so annoying and distracting.  Maybe some folks like the level that they bring, and that's fine. But if you were to have either a way to control how much you want the coaches input or to be able to turn them off entirely that would be fantastic and I would happily give this 5 stars!"
84,maltatude,Feb 2 at 10:39 PM,5,Fantastic way to work out and have fun!,"Love love love this app. Super fun way to get in/stay in shape. With the addition of meditation it’s now also a great way to practice mindfulness. Pros/cons time.

PROS
- It’s a good workout. You will sweat.
- It’s honestly pretty fun. 
- Huge library of workouts to explore. 
- Huge variety of music genres to explore.
- Multiple coaches add good motivation if you need that sort of thing.
- Company is constantly adding new features like boxing and mindfulness and new music. 

CONS
- It’s not cheap and the initial sticker shock gave me pause. But honestly, it costs about as much as two trips to Starbucks per month. Well worth it to me, your mileage may vary."
85,missbiss22,Feb 2 at 8:13 PM,5,You have to try this!,I started with the 14 day free trial and decided to buy the annual membership. I have been working out to supernatural for 6 weeks and I've already lost 8 pounds! There are new workouts everyday and the music is what makes it the most enjoyable for me! I'm dripping sweat when I'm done but its so much fun! I combine different workouts and I can exercise for up to an hour and it doesn't feel like that long. The coaches are awesome too. They are very motivating and help me get through the workouts. This beats a gym membership any day!
86,Elizabeth Meza,Jan 6 at 2:28 AM,1,“Instructors” make it to boring,"To use this have to pay about 19 dollars per day like going to the gym.  The instructor and terrible music made me not enjoy it. I don’t want to hear someone telling me what to do when one is trying to enjoy a workout/playing a virtual game.  For my taste, the music choice is terrible, and the voices of these people is too irritating.  I bought it yesterday thinking that it was going to be fun and it’s not.  I had more fun with boxing game and get same workout less expensive and les annoying. 

Try it if you want, but not worth it.  They are so many great game you can get the workout and fun.."

88,Zachary Edney,Feb 2 at 5:02 AM,5,The Best App In The Metaverse,"The absolute best app in the Metaverse. The most important reason I say that is, Supernatural uses the money we pay towards the subscription to make the app better. From adding coaches, adding new music, adding new scenery, adding filter options. What Supernatural is now is not what It was when I first downloaded. Not that it was good then, but they have made an effort to make it great. My only wish for this app, and I am careful to not say gripe because I have none at all. My only wish is that you could create a playlist of music to put in one workout. Having more control over the tempo, the coach, and the music you’d like to hear that workout. Outside of that, amazing app."
89,Lauriejay,Feb 18 at 6:31 AM,5,Love it!,I love this!!!! I just would like to add a suggestion for the creators. Can you please please please add a Wakanda Forever workout!!! I’ll greatly appreciate it! I’ve been promoting the game to ALL my friends.
90,Jak,Jan 31 at 3:52 AM,5,literally a life changer,"I've struggled with weight my entire adult life.  This is the first workout i've tried that made me want to keep going.  It's so much fun, beautuful scenery and tons of music to choose from.  I look forward to working out every day.  buying an occulus is the best thing i could have done for myself and supernatural is more than worth the monthly fee"
91,Moni Marie,Jan 7 at 6:15 PM,5,Team of Trainers,"Better than a gym membership, and I'll tell you why.  
1. I can wear what I want.
2. Don't have to load up gear.
3. Zero commute.
4. Don't have to deal with smelly gym.
5. No annoying people, no creepers, no one trying to talk to me.
6. When I'm done, I'm already home.

I have really enjoyed the workouts, the stretching, and the meditation.  The coaches are super.  Feels like my own personal team of trainers.  I feel encouraged and motivated.  The workouts are full body and I can feel progress.  More like fun than work.  I highly recommend.  Yes, there is a monthly subscription (cheaper than a gym membership and no registration fee).  But if you're already thinking of joining a gym to get into shape, and you hate all the same things I do about the gym, I recommend trying it for the trial at least.  It IS easy to cancel the subscription in your Settings on the app.  In Setting, you go to Subscriptions, then click on Supernatural and Cancel Subscription at the bottom.  I tracked down the process immediately after starting the trial, just in case.  But, I don't think you'll want to cancel. I'm definitely not."
92,Vincent Petitclerc,Feb 18 at 12:06 PM,5,"THE best fitness app, period.",Been on the trial for more than a week now and will certainly keep it. My wife bought it too for her VR Meta Quest 2 and love it equally. This is a huge game changer in fitness. Keep on going coaches team!!
93,Robin,3 days ago,1,Nop,So crazy expendía d is not as good as they try to make it look.
94,Jeff,Mar 2 at 5:34 AM,2,Probably not worth the subscription.,"This app is basically Beat Saber and Les Mills Body Combat put together. The only thing this app does better is the omnidirectional positioning, duck & weaving and better music licensing. But is that really worth 15-19/month? (After two months it's equivalent to the cost of those two apps I mentioned)."

96,BonnieH,Feb 14 at 8:02 AM,1,Auto Renewal cancellation,I had no idea that this would auto renew after the year was up. I have not turned on my Oculus headset in probably 7 months and used Supernatural maybe 10 times. How do I cancel the pending charge?
97,shelbysmom,Feb 19 at 12:26 AM,3,stop talking!,"would love to give this five stars but have a couple of problems with it. first of all the trainers, they talk way, way too much. I don't need  people telling me when to stand,  when to hit,  when to bring my knee up etc.  and can you please have them stop trying and I am emphasizing trying to sing to the songs? if there is a way to shut off the voices and just have the music that would be great. and in a lot of the sessions the items disappear way ahead of when I'm supposed to hit/punch them. I don't know if that is a flaw, if that is a lighting problem with the locations they choose or what, but half the time the items are disappearing halfway before they reach me. and what is focus mode? thanks..... needless to say I never sent this review so I'm sending it now but have discovered what focus mode is. love focus mode that way I don't have to listen to the trainers trying to sing. my biggest problem now is a lot of the items that come at you disappear halfway before they reach you is there a way to fix that?"
98,Jay54727,Feb 18 at 9:21 PM,2,I'm happy user,"When this game 1st was released I was in love with it because I thought it was fun.

I was going to buy the game at that 179 price that was the price at the time to buy the full version and own the game since then they raise that price to only a year's subscription such a rip off you people can't buy nothing but money disappointed customer"
99,Kimberly,Jan 26 at 10:44 PM,5,"Love, love, love","I cannot say enough good about this app, the coaches and the pure fun that I get from doing this app.  The music is amazing and they are always, daily adding new workouts, it is challenging.  I started my fitness journey on this app and I now can hike up to 10 miles because of how much my endurance for fitness has changed since doing this.  The coaches are all motivating and like no other app or fitness program I have been a part of their facebook community page is super supportive and helpful."
100,Mr. Implication,Feb 21 at 3:39 AM,4,"Great workout, Annoying instructors","This game is exactly what it claims to be. It gives me a decent cardio and upper body workout and to a lesser degree legs with their squatting under the triangles angle. That being said, the developers MUST ALLOW US to mute the instructors DURING workouts. I understand the warmup and cool down, but in the middle of a high intensity mode workout, the instructors (the Leanne woman especially) start talking about their mall jobs, and how their mom used to drive them around... etc, etc, just droning on and on and on.....it’s COMPLETELY DISTRACTING chatter that actually gets jn the way of the workout. I say if we pay a monthly fee, we should be able to MUTE THEM. And referring to these people as “coaches” is a STRETCH to say the least.
UPDATE:  I’d like to commend the developers for the “Focus Mode” feature they have added. I TRULY enjoy the workouts so much more now that I have the ability to mute the mindless drivel that the ……(ahem) “coaches” are constantly belching out. It’s APPARENT that I am not the only subscriber that finds the mindless chit chat of the “coaches” unbearable, and how that constant yammering almost caused me to cancel. I can’t imagine how many complaints were received for the SUPERNATURAL devs to actually listen to their subscribers and make a change. However, they don’t get 5 stars because the price is just TOO HIGH."
101,drummerJ99,Jan 4 at 2:48 AM,2,IMHO not worth price,"After a year subscription to this app, I have decided not to renew my subscription. Frankly it’s just not worth the $180 price tag. I get a much better sweat and workout using a $30 competitor. 

My thoughts:
The boxing is the only thing I really liked. The flow to me felt like a cheap knock of beat saber with worse music. Lol and the meditation shouldn’t be in a $180 app. 

If they would separate flow and box or cut the price drastically, I’d probably sign back up.

Update: music is subjective. And “the best music” is very subjective. Lol"
102,jise,Jan 4 at 11:45 PM,1,Impossible to drop subscription,"I have not used it for months. I have tried several times to cancel subscription and it is near impossible as it doesn’t show up on my quest subscriptions, but I keep getting billed every month. I had to claim it as fraudulent with my credit card company. Buyer beware."

104,Nina,Nov 26 at 12:11 AM,5,New Update Is Great!,"I’m updating my previous 3 star review because Supernatural has added what to me is a game changing feature.    new focus mode allows users to turn off the coaches’ instructions.  I was going to quit this month, but this opens up so many workouts I’d avoided so because I had heard the comments from coaches so many times.    There’s a wide range of music by popular artists that should cover most tastes.  I particularly love the Sweat Symphonies and Ho Down Throwdowns."
105,Bill,Jan 24 at 12:43 AM,5,Best work out on oculus or tv byfar,"At first I was  thinking what could’ve worth $20/mth.it  has replaced my $75 per visit one on one high intensity with better cardio and surprisingly good over all work out. Cant live with out and itisgetting better and better.love it. Great vr. The side benefit is that is has really improved my golf game and I hit every iron at least 10 yds linger. FYI, I am a 13 hcp with a decent swing so this is very meaningful."
106,Lilou,Jan 23 at 11:12 PM,5,Love it! Really addictive,"I love it because it gets me to sweat and exercise hard. The variety of music ( salsa, rap, rock n roll, pop, etc.) is great and really gets me to move everyday. I love the trainers too but I do mute some sometimes(!) and I just LOVE the settings and landscape. Being able to exercise all over the world in an immersive environment is so much fun. It does a good workout if you do it well and move up in the difficulty. They have options for warm up and stretching as well ( up to 15-20’) and I love those too.
I even started meditating because I love being in such wonderful places . And you can meditate on your own or guided meditation. Awesome.
Their customer service is very good too! 
I think the cost is worth it, because I use it several days a week for various lessons and it’s a different workout in virtual reality!"
107,LP,Feb 4 at 8:28 AM,2,Coaches are over the top,"I think the physics are good, the motions are good, the music is great, really liked everything except the coaches.  Is it just me or are they just too much?  If there was an option to turn the coach off or have one that is serious and not a Disney channel motivational character, I would still be in.  I changed it up for FitXR and I do not regret it."
108,ALDO,Jan 9 at 9:34 PM,1,Fun But Limited,"WONT LET ME CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION, i did it while in the app where i signed up and wont let me cancel it. charged me 180+ for an annual subscription when i would rather do it by the month

119,PotdColle,Jan 11 at 9:50 PM,5,Great app - totally worth the cost,"Although I was quite sceptical about paying what at first hand looks like a high price... It is not at all. Workouts are great, daily new workouts with all kinds of music keep from being bored of doing the same old routine. The many many accessibility options give me the necessary latitude to adapt to my handicaps. The whole team  should be applauded for the willingness to not only provide quality content but being so responsive to user's needs and adding features to answer to those particular needs such as focus mode, only facing targets for smaller places, one hand, chair exercises and so much more. Great work."
120,Mom is that you,Jan 12 at 11:21 AM,5,FUN!!,"If you love music and want to have a fun time while getting a bit of workout in….try this!!! I had so much fun the first time I tried it! Omg, I was laughing out loud and smiling!. I was having a blast!!! I would recommend to anyone. The scenes are incredible. The flow of the workout is awesome. Tons of great tracks, and perfect choreography to go with each. Put it all together and you might even want to replace your favorite class at the gym for this! I did!"
121,Fah,Jan 22 at 9:57 AM,1,Stop charging me!!!!,I've been getting charged for something i do not even use. I tried so many ways to cancel through the app and it says it doesn't recognize my credentials. Is this a possible scam?!

123,NinnerDoat,Jan 8 at 6:22 AM,5,Love Supernatural!,"I have been more consistent, more active, and more determined to get my workouts in since I started Supernatural. I love that I can choose the level of intensity of the workout and even save the workouts themselves on the app. The music is great -- definitely something for everyone, and the coaches are really good, too. I also love being able to workout in such beautiful locations. Sometimes I have to remind myself to pay attention to the targets than the background, it's so pretty! If you're on the fence, definitely sign up for the trial. It will blow you away."
124,Miya,15 days ago,1,Does not work,It will not let me sign in or nothing .
125,Revenant2,Nov 19 at 6:21 PM,1,Absolutely Not Worth The Cost!,"I understand there are costs involved in developing apps, so a REASONABLE subscription cost would be acceptable. But when you start off paying HUNDREDS of dollars EACH YEAR, that is STUPID!!

In one of your responses, you stated we might want to compare this to a gym membership cost per month. Well, THIS IS NOT A GYM! It does not have gym equipment, showers, or any of the other amenities that gyms have. 10 Fitness charges 10 bucks a month for a membership, and you get all the goodies.

This might be worth it at half the cost, but I, for one, am not going to pay two or three hundred dollars a year, especially for an app that still has a LONG WAY TO GO.  Thanks, but no thanks."
126,Cher,Feb 25 at 8:47 AM,1,Can't get into it at all. It always says,Never have been able to get into it because even after changing my pin it still won't let me play. This is getting old after I pd what I have for my vr
127,Ralph,Dec 2 at 4:57 PM,5,"Fun, highly impactful fitness app","I have never been a weight lifter or like running in place at the gym.  This is worth every penny.  I get my heart rate up over 150, I have fun with the music and targets, and the coaches are excellent.  The coaches seem like they are in the room with me and getting better as time goes by.  I am at my target weight and feel like I am as sharp and strong as ever."
128,Amber E.,Jan 14 at 6:36 AM,5,Beat Saber designed for exercise. Love!,"I cannot recommend this app enough, honestly. I've recently started a VR based journey towards better fitness and health. I started with Beat Saber and I absolutely love that game. I then got a link from someone to try out Supernatural and I was instantly hooked. Here's why:
1.) They have an amazing category of songs that the workouts are set to, including some of my favorite bands like Breaking Benjamin, Evanescence, Seether, Thirty Seconds to Mars, and many others. 
2.) They have a few different game modes: boxing, stretching, meditation, and flow (which is incredibly similar to Beat Saber)
3.) The interface tracks your workouts and progress on your fitness journey, including stats and analytics on your performance during the workouts. 
4.) THE COACHES. Oh my goodness, the coaches. They have such an amazing group of funny and encouraging coaches who walk you through the exercises. Even though you aren't interacting with them directly, they are such a joy to work with. One coach, Mark, always has me in stitches, alternating between advice, encouragement, and actually singing along with the song I was working out to. 


If you are even considering trying this app, please do yourself a favor and give it a chance. You won't regret it."
129,Holly,Jan 4 at 8:06 PM,5,Love it!,"I was skeptical about VR fitness games, but this has really changed my mind. When I look at my Apple Watch, I can see how I visibly have increased my heart rate, I was sweating and out of breath and sore the next day. But it was FUN. It’s so much easier to start working out when it feels more fun.  You can choose your intensity, there are different activities…I thought the flow workout (with the bats) would be a lot like BeatSaber but it was definitely more intense. The meditation is so nice and relaxing and even motivating. I told my boyfriend “I really like what this disembodied voice is saying!” Seriously worth the subscription fee. This is perfect for people who haven’t worked out in a while and wanna get back into it."
130,Amethyst,Jan 5 at 5:48 PM,5,Fun Fun Fun,"I was reluctant for two reasons, I thought this was similar to another popular app, and I didn't like the idea of subscription service. I am so glad I tried the free trial! This app is a blast, it's a refreshing fun butt kicking workout every morning. I bodybuild and hate cardio, this app makes it so much fun I am happy to get it done drenched in sweat! Music selection is amazing, so much better than I expected! Additionally the scenery, the meditation ( love the motivational inspo to start my day) the trainers are awesome and fun. This app is worth every penny to me. I especially like that the creators seem to listen to feedback and make improvements often. I love the inclusivity and variety of trainers, music, styles and personality."
131,Dante,Jan 25 at 10:45 PM,4,Room for improvement,"I am pleased to provide a review for Supernatural. In my experience using the app, I have found it to be a great resource for workouts and overall fitness. The workouts, particularly those led by Coach Mark, have been especially enjoyable. Mark's motivational and uplifting style has helped me to push myself to my full potential during each workout.

However, I do have one major suggestion for the app developers to consider. I believe that the inclusion of audio feedback as an intensity gauge would greatly enhance the app's functionality and make it a more complete and perfect fitness companion. By allowing the app to select the intensity of the workout based on the user's audio feedback, it could potentially provide a more personalized and interactive experience. For example, if the user is participating in a high intensity workout, the app could offer further sub-levels of difficulty based on the user's feedback. This could also be useful for adjusting the intensity of the workout if the user is struggling or if their heart rate becomes too high.

Overall, I highly recommend the Oculus fitness app and believe that implementing audio feedback as an intensity gauge would further improve its effectiveness as a fitness resource.

Edit: coach Leanne is hands down the best thing about this app. Her motivation level is so contagious it almost definitely gets you every time. We need more of her and her workout."
132,Ace,Feb 9 at 10:19 AM,5,Good workout,"Great workout programs & good fitness levels, just wish there was a non subscription version with maybe dlc programs that we can choose from."
133,Gwinny,Jan 3 at 9:52 PM,5,Obsessed!,"It's been tough getting back into working out since leaving Active Duty. Gym membership, forced myself (multiple times) to go 5x/week for a month or more, but it was a total struggle for me to find motivation to get out the door. Am I REALLY expected to shave my legs every day after 40? No. That can't be right. There has to be a better way.

This app is a total game changer! Not only are there the boxing and flow workouts - which are AMAZING - but there are also meditations and guided stretches. Every time I go in for a stretch I'm all ""what the heck, may as well get a quick workout in, too... Sneaky and I love it! You know when people talk about that ""high"" from exercise? Never felt it. Never. Not in 10 years of extreme workouts throughout my Military Service. ONE workout in Supernatural and I'm actually so blissed-out that tears sprout in the corner of my squished-out-happy-face.

I WOULD like to see some targeted back stretches added (Coach Raneir!), the boxing exercises remind me that my muscles aren't elastic anymore and the upper/lower body exercises don't quite hit the spot."
134,megmeister,Oct 2 at 2:11 AM,5,You CAN mute the trainer,"This is an awesome purchase! love every aspect of Supernatural especially the scenery but moreover you certainly can't mute the trainers! I'm responding to someone who wrote a review 17 days ago who said they canceled because they couldn't mute the trainer.Just simply go to the upper right hand corner gear of settings once you're in supernatural and you can make the music loudest and the trainers lowest.  This is the feature that has really helped my concentration. Once I became familiar with the tips and tricks the trainers were giving me, at that point I lowered them to 00 sound  so I could concentrate on my form!

I love this app. I hope and pray they will do more low impact boxing with rock selections 80""s through 2000 including grunge and other alternative rock. Cranberries and Toto would be cool."
135,Tower,Jan 24 at 3:40 PM,2,Not worth the price.,"After paying the sub for a few months, I’ve decided that the app isn’t worth the price.  I don’t buy the company line about their high costs, honestly. The environmental backgrounds are dated and very low-res. While they release new workouts regularly, it might be weeks between the releases of the specific workout/level/trainer you’re wanting to do. I really wanted to like the app, but I’ve unsubscribed and will be exploring other boxing apps."
136,Babette,Jan 30 at 11:46 AM,5,I’m a -Gulp -Senior,I don’t feel like a senior especially after a good workout. I really like that the warmups and cool downs are short. Getting rid of my gym memberships!!!
137,Amy Taylor,Dec 31 at 8:13 PM,5,This is the best indoor workout,"I’ve been consistently using this for a month.  If you’ve struggled to be consistent with exercise, give this a try.  I love it so much that I just joined for a year. I hope they keep updating with new music and locations because the novelty of new scenery with each song is a huge part of the appeal.   It’s gray and cold where I live for about 5-6 months, so I can’t even describe how nice it is to escape to these beautiful locations.   If you build wearable tech to expand these workouts, I will buy it."
138,TUNESKI,Jan 21 at 5:38 PM,1,Coach are annoying,"Cant mute the coach who won’t shut up , super annoying I’m not trying to listen to someone talk while working out."
139,Geontis,Jan 18 at 5:20 AM,5,Excited to work out is a first,I decided to give it a try. This is my 1st time. I have really never did a work out before. At the age of 42 that's saying a lot. I got the quest 2 as a gift and thought maybe working out could be fun. This app is amazing. I just did my 1st work out and plan on doing it everyday. They have made it fun and it's like a game that you don't even realize that you are actually doing a work out. I also love that you can choose your music which hypes you up and your work out is also keeping up to the beat of the songs.
140,Slocrazycatlady,Jan 2 at 9:29 PM,5,Great Exercise Program,"I absolutely LOVE Supernatural!! The coaches, work outs and music are all amazing and incredibly motivating! I struggle going to the gym because it feels like a chore and my self confidence isn’t great. VR and Supernatural have really made me love working out. I look forward to it every day and it really feels like a fun game that makes you SWEAT!!"
141,Sandy,Jan 14 at 1:27 AM,5,Super workout and super fun!,"Since buying my Oculus Quest 2 at the end of November 2022 I have only missed one day of getting into the headset and working out with Supernatural and that was only because of a nationwide travel snafu. I absolutely love working out on Supernatural. I love the encouragement from coaches and the ability to choose if I hear them or not after the warm up. I’m one of those people who would skip a warm up and/or cool down (not a good habit, I know) so I appreciate that there is at least a short warm up and cool down for each workout. Those can also be skipped if I’m continuing on to another workout. I feel like I get a darn good workout by the time I finish and the stretching and meditation sessions are added benefits. The annual subscription is well worth it since it is so fun I want to do it every day, there’s a wide choice of music and lengths of workouts, and I really look forward to getting back to being fit. I’m already seeing huge improvements in my stamina, and firming lots of areas. I’m 61 and I feel like this could be fun for all adults. I never stop talking about Supernatural to my friends! I’m addicted!"
142,Ri907,Jan 27 at 12:37 AM,5,Best workout app ever,I absolutely love this app! Great workouts with good backgrounds and amazing coaches! I especially liked that it had up to date music for the workouts!
143,Alex,Jan 19 at 10:14 AM,4,Really fun,"I only used this for the one week free trial, but I found it to be a lot of fun! I had previously mentioned that I did not have enough space to play, and so would not be continuing my subscription even though I enjoyed the game and would like to continue. I did receive a response that helps with the limited space. I am still unsure if I’ll have enough space, as I’m moving and am yet to see how small my room is in person, but I will definitely keep that in mind and I may subscribe once I figure out how much space, time, and money I have in my new place. 

I had two complaints, but one was addressed in a response so I only left the following. There was supposed to be a two week free trial if I signed up for the year plan, but both that plan and the monthly plan had the same one week end date for the trial. I’m only complaining about that as false advertising; I can’t really complain about free stuff otherwise."
144,Shyshy,Jan 18 at 8:51 AM,3,Love it but…,I really enjoyed my subscription and if I was affordable I would purchase the entire year. I recommend the support and the coaches are great. Make you really want to push through. Well I’m going to miss it. Enjoy the subscription as much as you can. It really is fun and will get you sweating even if you think you won’t sweat during a workout. My mom even enjoy the low intensity workouts! Yes try it!!!!
145,Samiam,Jan 2 at 11:00 PM,2,Not even a good work out,"I mean going through 25 minutes of the work out with my Fitbit on.. my heart rate peaked at 92 bpm.. in a cardio work out or treadmill it goes up to 140-145 sustained… the scenery is nice but loses novelty quickly.. don’t know how $20 a month is justified especially if you work our regularly .. I can understand a market for it for stay at home moms or people with gym anxiety.. but for majority I don’t think this gives you even a really good workout.. you will probably get more results fallowing a video or using home treadmill.  Try it out a Fitbit on do a twenty workout see how much calories you burn and then use a YouTube video, I guarantee you it will be a good 30-50% more"
146,Kandice,Feb 3 at 6:41 PM,5,Love it!,Great way to get up and move your entire body! The veracity in music and workouts is also great!
147,Paul T,Dec 16 at 7:42 AM,1,"Great concept, insane cost","The idea is awesome, really wanted to see what it had to offer, but, having an actual gym membership as I do for $25/month  with access to tons of equipment, sauna, and trainers. I can say without even trying, absolutely no way this is worth anywhere near what they are asking. If it was like $1 to $3 a month I might think about it, but almost $200 a year, no way. I can get the same blood pumping playing beat Saber for one cost."
148,McGee,Dec 29 at 8:30 AM,1,This app sucks,"You can’t use this app unless you have money, or steal your parents debit card, because of the required subscription


Edit: if you want a workout, I’d suggest getting “The Thrill of the Fight”. It’s only $11CAD, and no subscription required, and it will do you pretty well if you’re not super serious about getting super fit. And another plus is that it strengthens your reaction speed and hand-eye coordination."
149,Azazlin,Dec 23 at 5:02 AM,5,Funtastic,I love it. I decided I needed to try to work out. Someone recommended this. I have retrolisthesis in half my spine. I can do the work outs. It works with me not being able to bend. You get to chose how low you can squat. I have lost about 14 lbs in the last 8 weeks. I can squat again. I am able to do the 20 plus hard levels (I’m not at pro). I love love love the music selections.
150,Lucas,Jan 14 at 10:23 AM,3,"Enjoyable but, too expensive","I have enjoyed supernatural  and tried it out for a year. It’s a great way to get in shape, and get you moving. I get sweaty everytime but, I just can’t justify spending the money when I can get live classes from pelaton on their app for a fraction of the cost. 

5 stars for the actual game 1 star for the cost."
151,Kim,Jan 14 at 8:04 AM,3,Awesome but too expensive,"I really love the app but it doesn’t replace going to the gym and all that comes with it.If it was cheaper I’d keep it for a good cardio workout but right now I need to choose my gym membership first. I understand it takes a lot to produce but new workouts each day are not necessary seeing as there is only flow and boxing. The warm ups and cool downs are only 1 minute each. Lower the price please because with exchange, it’s it’s close to $30 Cdn/mo. That’s insane when I can own another popular workout app for that price."
152,Conor,Dec 7 at 5:17 AM,5,Awesome app,"This app is definitely a game changer! I don't know of anything else that gets me sweating as much and as quickly as Supernatural. I love the scenic settings and you guys have a lot of different music choices! 

My only complaint is that I don't always love the playlists you come out with. Sometimes I choose a playlist with multiple songs just to hear one of them. 

It would be awesome if you could skip songs so i dont have to suffer through a terrible one to get to the song I wanted in the first place. Or my other suggestion would be to build a bunch of one song routines that I can easily stack on top of each other. Either way, I just wish I had more freedom in song selection."
153,ŃÎTRØ,Feb 11 at 7:00 PM,5,Bro I’m actually losing calories,I’m not even gonna lie this is kinda expensive not as expensive as a gym membership

I have recalibrated and other than stopping my workout to reset the guardian every 2 minutes I have had it. There is no support that can assist and for an annual fee I would rather find a new app."
155,Ted Bowman,Feb 6 at 2:00 AM,2,Glitchy,"Only works about half the time, lots of errors, workout is average at best and absolutely not worth the money. Cancelling and looking for something better. Shouldn't be hard."

Also, you guys have DEFTONES in your playlist, that’s amazing!"
157,Badger,Jan 11 at 10:31 PM,1,Not for Beginners,"If you're trying to make the jump from being a desk chair gamer or a couch gamer to getting fit using VR, look elsewhere. This app has different level impact workouts, but all of the ""Low Impact"" (supposedly the easiest to do) are too fast and too difficult for beginners. There's no other way to figure out how to find beginner-level, slow workouts to music you enjoy. Oh, and the boxing? It forces you to switch your stance between southpaw (lefties) and basic (righties) *during the same workout! Which will totally mess with your head if you've ever taken any amount of boxing classes. I did the 7 day free trial and boy am I glad I didn't buy into this - it's more expensive than the gym with fewer options to feel good about the exercise you're getting."
158,Phoenix,Jan 9 at 6:11 AM,4,Almost outstanding,"Recently started using Oculus for workout and after trying different apps including FitXR, Supernatural by far exceeds expectations in many ways. The views are amazing, the workouts are immersive, love the portal changes and trainer guidance. A few suggestions that would take it one step further. One downside is the music selection and limitations around it. I love the electronic genre but selection is subpar and could use more variety from globally known artists (Tiesto, Armin Van Buuren, Above and Beyond, etc…) Another downside is that we can’t create our own playlist from current and it won’t allow to skip a bad song, you have to forego the whole workout if you don’t care for the song. New leg movements  to add would be great also. The subscription price is high but is worth it with continuous improvements."

160,jlo,Jan 6 at 1:59 AM,4,Mostly love...,"I too wish this cost less... I would gladly pay a lower price, but I really only enjoy some of these workouts, so it is not worth this much cost to me. I wish there were more ""Pros Only"" levels, especially flow style. I am a dancer, but also middle aged and somewhat out of shape, and the lower level workouts (L & M) are just not as fun. I also can not bring myself to do some because of the music... I greatly prefer the EDM, and even the ""harder"" rock and metal. So I really only use flow, ""H"" levels, with some intense music. That being said... I love those levels, more so now that I can mute the trainers, and I keep coming back for 1 month now and then. I really hope the cost can be lower at some point. $120 for a year? I'd do it."
161,Grayson,Feb 28 at 12:50 AM,1,This is dumb,This is a fun looking game couldn’t wait to play and when I got on it cost money sooooooo stupid terrible game!!!!!

164,lesliedawn61,Jan 4 at 3:16 PM,3,HELP,has great potential but find it's not very user friendly for the newbie on a free trial! it keeps taking me to a very advanced level and playing music genres i didn't request. when i want to repeat a routine i need to listen to all the initial instructions again instead of just straight into the exercise. not sure i'll go past the 7 day trial unless someone can direct me in a way that makes sense !
165,Kari,Nov 4 at 3:31 AM,5,My favorite workout of all time!,"I don’t like exercising for the most part. Going to the gym is boring and tedious. The Supernatural app has made exercising fun and addictive!!! I love it!! 

I absolutely adore the coaches… they make me laugh and push me to do better. I love all holiday workouts…The Nightmare before Christmas workout is fantastic!!

I love the scenery, and the fact that they are always adding new music and new workouts. Bonus, the new knee kicks really up’d the game.

Besides letting me make up my “own” playlist to exercise to I wouldn’t change a thing. I have been working out consistently for 6 months now and losing weight!! Yay me!!"
166,Cindy Matt,Jan 3 at 7:21 AM,4,So sweaty!,Great workout! I’ve been on the free trial for three weeks and getting such a great workout. I know I want to continue with the program once my trial runs out. I do wish that you could earn discounts by doing workouts or something it does seem like a steep price with no options to just pay one time and go.

168,Travis,Jan 6 at 8:56 AM,4,Pretty darn good,I may not keep this one but not because it's not great. I am just so fed up with prescription based software. As fed up as I am I am seriously considering biting the bullet and keeping this one. The workouts are great and really fun. There is a pretty good selection of music also.
169,IronGwaziFan,Oct 16 at 4:42 PM,2,Les Mills is better and no subscription,"i tried this app. it's not bad, but the makers are absolutely out of their minds if they think they are providing a service that is worth 20 dollars a month!  The only people that must pay this fee are people with more money than they know what to do with or just people that don't know any better.  If you notice all the people that rated this 5 stars didn't say anything about Les Mills because they just don't know it exists.  It's absolutely shocking to me that they expect people to pay monthly what amounts to MORE than what a lot of people pay for an ACTUAL GYM MEMBERSHIP.  Are you joking?!?!

Meanwhile, Les Mills Bodycombat is out on Quest. I bought it on sale and I can now USE IT FOREVER FOR THE SAME PRICE SUPERNATURAL CHARGES TO USE IT FOR 1 MONTH! And guess what....LES MILLS IS BETTER!   Do yourself a favor and don't fall for this total scam.  Go over and buy Les Mills it will get you in way better shape than Supernatural will and you won't have to watch your bank account go down every month to do it."
170,TaylorGang,Jan 13 at 11:59 AM,5,More knees please,I love this game but it was  a tease when they starting added the knee strikes to boxing since they have only came out with 3 boxing songs.
171,Alex,Nov 14 at 4:21 AM,1,Stop scamming people,"I love the workout, I really do. But here is a fact: I cancelled my subscription over a year ago. My Meta account shows I have no subscription. Guess what. If you login to your supernatural website, you will see you are still subscript to it.
A year ago, 2021, I contact Facebook and ask them why am I keep getting charged for something I cancel. They suggested me to go check the developer's website, and I did. Found out the subscription was still active. I was mad but i thought I was my fault for checking. I cancelled it and thought this would be the end of it.
Anyway, I got a email from supernatural today that says my subscription payment didn't went through. I went back to the website and checked, found out the subscription I ended last year was active again!! Luckily, my old credit card expired April 2022, otherwise I may keep getting charged for $18.99 USD per month."

173,Barb,Jan 10 at 1:30 AM,1,Not what I expected,"Is it just stretching and boxing? Because that’s all I can find. For that price I expected to choose from different types of workouts (box, stretch, dance, yoga, etc). I am a new user, so maybe I’m missing something, but the boxing feels pretty similar to Beat Saber."
174,Wanda Jaye,Dec 17 at 4:51 PM,5,Absolutely so in love with this game,"I’m a new gamer, this is the first game my friends introduced me to… I can easily work out for a hour boxing or dancing my two favorites and work up a sweat without realizing that I’m doing hard core cardio… it’s really a great game to get your work outs done."
175,Luba,Dec 11 at 1:10 AM,5,Best work out ever,"I wanted to be find a workout that I can get into. I hate gyms and elliptical. I hated cardio, I had to push myself so hard to exercise. Super natural changed my life! Really, that good. I'm looking forward to my exercises now. Doing 3 a day, eating classes like candy 🍭 burning around 1000 Cal per day. The scenery are beautiful, great music, fun coaches. Can't get enough. So grateful."
176,Ant,Jan 12 at 12:59 AM,3,Need more boxing exercises and music,"I love the music in flow exercises, but the boxing exercises don’t seem to have the same amount of good music.  Developers should consider having the same set of music in flow available in boxing exercises.  Then, this will be a 5-star application."

178,Shadow,Dec 10 at 7:50 AM,5,Best Fitness and Music game out there!,"I have tried all of the fitness games out there and this is by far the best ! They update on a regular basis, keeping the content relevant, they have artist collections, making it easier to get through the workouts (especially on the days I just don’t want to do a thing) and the trainers help keep your head in the game! They also have different meditation sessions you can do if you just need to relax and reflect. Super natural is just well rounded and keeps the FOMO at bay! It’s not free but we’ll worth the price with all the content !"
179,Kevin,Dec 6 at 3:11 AM,2,"Could be good as Beatsaber, but it's not","Edit: Turn on Focus Mode(should be called Music Only or something more intuitive) if you don't want to hear the trainer. 

It would be really great for each song to have multiple difficulties. It's lame to find your favorite song is only a low or medium intensity/difficulty. Every single song should have a pros only option.

Playlists are cool, in concept. It's nice to be able to pick a playlist that is the length of time you know you have available. Custom playlists would be better. There are so many playlists that have only 1 or 2 songs I like. Would be great to combine together the songs I like."
180,Piray,Dec 28 at 9:09 PM,5,One app that has everything!!,"This app is so worth the money. I hate exercising and for years it has been a torture!!

182,Collin,Dec 29 at 11:06 AM,4,Love the workouts,Really enjoying the work outs and such but really wish they were more choices on music and more variety maybe some electric edm or dubstep and possibly an option at start of work outs to what songs you loving and using it 2-4 times a day just wish there was music to get you more pumped into the work outs other than that 4 stars with room to grow on the music side  like the moon rider game has a lot of options for songs and ones that really get you going they even have special packs added for like beat saver song editions pack but if you had the edm dubstep or electric that moonrises has it would be a six star rating 🔥🔥
183,Abby,Dec 5 at 4:41 PM,3,So many minor issues,"First, I hate the inability to restart a song. This game isn't about perfection, but sometimes an interruption messes me up really bad and I want to restart.

Second, I want to build a playlist of songs.

Third, the ""floor"" is miscalculated sometimes. I want to be able to raise and lower that quickly without having to recalibrate.

Fourth, I want searches to save settings. I'm not ready for hard-level yet.

I want to be able to filter out types, permanently until I change it. If I wanted to do paddles, I'd just play beat saber.

It seems like I can't replay something from the menu after I finish it.

I'd love to be able to filter certain coaches out. One coach, I hate his jokes.

I'd love to be able to mute coaches totally.

I want a fundamentals course that just constantly reminds you to keep your arms up.

A timer on screen for how long the song has would be nice.

Being able to add categories of favorites would be so nice. Custom categories or things like (Just fun, Squats, Fundamentals, Fast)

I cannot believe songs don't have difficulty settings or speed settings.

I like when the coaches throw out the names of punches, I'd love sessions that were just that.

What this game purports to do, it feels like it does really well, but the lack of obvious features hits pretty heavy."

187,Susan,Dec 10 at 2:42 AM,5,Bought this last and should’ve been 1st,"Feel foolish for trying every other VR exercise game. This game is it. It’s got all the things… music for all tastes, crunches, knee kicks, punches, flow, stretching, meditation, and the scenery is crazy. I just tried out punching on the moon.  Wild. Anyways a few things - really cost prohibitive - I’m so bummed I didn’t purchase this during the Black Friday sale, but I had no idea how superior it was. Now it’s 100 dollars more, and I’m about to end my free trial. That’s a lot of money to put out after just purchasing the headset. So please more deals or make this more cost effective. 
Secondly I’ve got the companion app on my phone and for some reason it’s duplicating activity that’s being reported to my Apple Fitness account. So both this app and oculus are providing health data. I can’t figure out how to turn that off. 
Love the music. Love the flow workouts the most. It’s been a wonderful treat for me. Thank you."
188,Riley,Jan 25 at 3:10 AM,2,Not Actually free,It seems like a really cool game but onjiuce you load in it shows you options on your monthly/yearly payment at a pretty high price. So unless you are willing to pay its no worth the download thinking its free. So i dont really know why its labled free.
189,Calvin,Jan 2 at 12:07 AM,4,"Great App, Please update music",I really love the app and workouts mainly boxing workouts.

Supernatural has finally added leg exercises to a few sets, and I think it should be included in ALL the sets! However, it would be nice to mix / match tracks from some sets into another set.

I am very good at Beat Saber, on expert+ and it is pretty good exercise. I can easily get in my cardio. That being said, Supernatural is a MUCH better workout. My watch stats show this clearly.

They have some really good music selections too. You are definitely going to swear with these workouts for sure. Don’t get discouraged if you feel like you can’t finish a workout because it’ll build your endurance by the end of the week. 
If you’re a little competitive with yourself this is a good workout to try to beat yourself in as well. I love it."

201,Robit,Nov 29 at 6:38 PM,5,Fitness oriented beat-saber = win!,"Edit: it's been 2 years since I wrote my first review and I'm still a subscriber to supernatural and use it four to five times a week. The app has continued to improve over the years adding things like a boxing mode and additional options that I previously requested in my first review. There is no doubt that this app has changed my life for the better and has gotten me in better shape than I've ever been as an adult. Until I discovered VR fitness I've never been able to stick to a exercise routine. This is a game changer. 


Original review:
After playing Beat-Saber for the past 4 months it has become a defacto workout for me. I'm always on the lookout for similar games and Supernatural is one of the best alternatives I've found. 

I like that it is fitness oriented with a new premade playlist and theme for each day. It provides a warm-up song and then a decent variety of songs that work both upper and lower body.

This isnt a replacement for Beat-Saber but I use it as a supplement to my daily workout. None of the songs I've played make you feel as amazing as nailing a Expert+ song on BS but it definitely gives me an overall better workout.

If they keep new songs coming and add a few features, like turning off the trainer voices and customizing the color scheme, I will be a long-time subscriber.

Great job to everyone involved!"
202,Boyce Pi,17 days ago,1,no way to subscribe,"i am in texas and it keep asking me to subscribe by credit card from HonKong, otherwise the add payment method is never clickable, maybe they just want some tax benefit by setting such barriers when they see my account is somehow link to a preferred tax region. the customer service is interesting only reply to review with 4-5 stars and not a single word to people facing difficulties with 1 star. super non user friendly and obviously the app dont care about  users, as long as there still are someone willing to jump in this trap and contributing monthly fee, they feel good enough. seriously doubting  this company will keep developing after its initial investment or harvest the first round of payment from users."

Sometimes I just want to listen to good music, flail my arms, dodge triangles, and just enjoy myself. The constant chatting just pisses me off."
204,Qqq,Nov 28 at 2:28 AM,5,"My new obsession BUT , I canceled","Update #2 : YEE HAW !! I just did my first workout without a trainer blathering nonsense in my ear. I hardly have the words to express my gratitude.  Thank you  Supernatural  for listening to us. This makes your app perfect.  Oculus friends,  get this app. Get it ! Get it ! Make your own choice about whether you want the trainer . Now , it's your choice to make. Sigh......so happy.
Update :
I just canceled this. It broke my heart. The reason is because they haven't  given the option to mute the trainer during the workout. Those who find it helpful , great ! Those who hate it are just stuck with it.  I've contacted them here and on their website and their response  , every time , is just pre made blurbs that don't respond at all. For the rest of you who feel as I do , I hope they take this issue more seriously.
I am replacing this with Fitt and Saber.
I absolutely love this workout.  Both forms.  It is fun and challenging at the same time.  I've never combined those two words,  ever !  And the environments  , they add so much.
BUT , please,  please remove the trainer voice over.  It dramatically reduces my enjoyment and more importantly it takes me out of the zen like flow provided by the music and targets. 
Get this app. It is pricey,  yes , but oh so fun and effective.
Update :  I'm dismayed to see how many reviews on this page ask , as do I  , for an option to mute the trainers. Why are you unwilling to do this when so many people are asking for it  ??"
205,Cindi,Nov 27 at 12:21 AM,5,Best workout app I’ve found,"Great workout, never boring. I’m 52 and this has dropped my weight 10 lbs in a month as well as built great arm and core muscle.  The muscle strength I’ve gained in my neck and back actually help support my spine and reduce my pain from my degenerative disc disease and is a great cardio to keep my heart healthy as I age. I have the settings adjusted to reduce squats to avoid too much neck strain and prevent degenerative flare-ups. 

Love the scenery!!! It gives me the boost I need now that hiking season is over as I love to be out in nature.  It’s so realistic you’ll want to reach down and put your hand in the water, and you’ll not only hear the breeze, but turn on your ceiling fan and you’ll also feel it and almost believe you’re actually there! 

If the trainers voiceovers annoy you, you can reduce their volume or turn it completely off. I keep the voiceovers low enough to hear as I find the reminders to relax my shoulders or tighten my core muscles helpful but not so high I get aggravated when they start rambling on with personal stories I don’t care about in the middle of a workout. 

No matter your age or fitness level, as a nurse I would highly recommend this game for your personal fitness and health. 

I’ve tried fit xr and find this boxing to be far superior and the flow gets my heart rate much higher than beat saber. Plus it’s easier to follow than beat saber, imo. 

With 2+ new workouts added daily. It’s well worth the $20/mo because I feel like I never do the same workout twice. 

Fair warning if you’re 50+…. Have some ibuprofen handy because you’re going to feel this workout in every muscle and joint!!!"

208,bananimus3,Dec 5 at 12:16 AM,4,Getting better! Still kinda pricey.,"Updated review! 

Tried it out for a couple months. Overall production quality is *excellent.* Variety of music and regular content updates. Workouts designed with more total body engagement than Beat Saber with more lunges, etc. The replayability of my favorite levels *used to be* hugely diminished by the inability to silence the trainers (no offense, trainers!). It was distracting and took away from the flow as I improved on my favorite routines. This made me less likely to stay engaged, which is the worst possible outcome, long term. 

Update! You now have the ability to choose mute trainers with focus mode. To me that's great. Now as I master a routine I can really stay in the flow. Bumping my review up a star as that's a small but major improvement. 

There's still the high monthly fee ($10/mo would be the sweet spot to me) and it's still hard to justify over just playing Beat Saber. There I buy music once and forever, even if I need to be a little more self motivated to push myself and the motion variety of the maps isn't as great (though this can be improved by paying attention to form).

Big thank you to Supernatural for listening to their customers regarding control over coaching. Hopefully as more sign up the economies bring pricing down, even if that's hard with production and licensing costs."

One thing I would really like to see that I think works make the app even better is the ability pick and choose your favorite songs from different workouts and make your own workout. It would be nice to create your own workout with your favorite songs as well as the ability to mix different levels.

Keep up the good work."
213,AutumnFaery,Dec 31 at 11:15 PM,4,"Fantastic workouts, with height problem","I've been seeing a few people rave about the workouts in this app, so I decided to try it out.

An hour later, I'm hooked. The workouts are phenomenal, the coaches are encouraging without being annoying, I haven't heard any mention (yet) of losing weight, burning fat, or any other non-positive messages, and the music selection is top-notch (do the Encanto workout if you need to cry while your work out).

My one complaint is that I've noticed there seems to be a ""height drift""while I'm playing.  I calibrated when I first started the app, but about 3/4 through a longer boxing workout, I noticed that all the targets and squat bars felt like they were coming in higher.

I finished the workout, recalibrated, and started a long flow workout. Around the 3rd or 4th song, I noticed the same thing, to the point that it was challenging to hit some of the higher targets (and not challenging at all to hit the squats and lunges).

This time I happened to look down and noticed that the platform seemed too high.  Between songs, I reached down and figured out that my hand passed through the platform at about mid-shin.

In other apps, if I feel like the height is off, I can tweak things by shifting up or down and holding the menu button to recenter (or using the height slider), but I'm Supernatural, this only allows me to recenter from side to side, not up or down.

This is not a deal breaker, by any means. You may find yourself reaching higher as a workout goes on, but it doesn't keep you from finishing. I would suggest adding the ability to do height recalibration during a workout, though - either with the menu button or by allowing us to go into settings in between songs.

Other than that, it's a perfect workout app!"
214,Stolen Thunder,Nov 20 at 8:28 AM,5,Great workout,"I can’t wait for more longer workouts with the knee kicks! Also would like newer rock and pop songs. 

Also to the Developers: Since I hate doing trials with payment details up front, I rarely try them. Had this game had a trial without me needing to provide payment details, I would have tried this over a year ago and would have happily paid since then."
215,Sindraith666,Mar 18 at 10:57 AM,1,Why just why,The reason I gave it a 1 star is because it says free but it isn't true I get the subscription thing but it isn't free if u r going to make it seem free than let it b free don't make people think it is if it's not there was nothing in the description saying about scription I didn't know til I was gonna try it all I'm saying is make sure to let people know it's subscription instead of non subscription needed I didn't know til I went to try and it said free trial than it showed after this free trial u need to pay so much a month wat about people who can't sub u just gonna let them find out after almost everything is set up
216,Brian,Nov 19 at 8:16 AM,5,"Great workouts, great app","I didn’t expect to use my headset for anything exercise-related, but decided to give this app a shot since it had a trial.  After just the initial Flow tutorial, I was really surprised at how much of a workout this actually offers!  I love feeling like part of the music. The trainers are great, especially when they have commentary on a particular song or section of the set, which makes you feel like they are actually doing the workout with you.  Very cool overall, keeping the sub."
217,Rex,Dec 31 at 2:05 PM,1,South Africa,Sorry to say lived this app when i bought it in USA but now can't use it in South Africa....might inform people before they buy it
218,Sandra Prince,Nov 2 at 6:52 PM,5,Awesome @Home Workout,"This exercise app is AWESOME 👏🏾!!! I love using it to help me with my workout. Going to the actual gym isn’t a must anymore and my workout is done all over the world which I absolutely LOVE 💕. 
Making a commitment to workout at home has been a much better outcome for me. I pay my membership and commit to a certain number of days a week and now I am 💯 loving my experience with a committed workout that I can afford and don’t have to worry about being in a crowded gym. 
This app has many challenges to choose from as well as different instructors. I get to experience more with this app than I would get to experience with a personal one on one trainer at an actual gym.
To me this is an Awesome @Home Workout app and I recommend it to any and everyone. The experience is great and most importantly it keeps us active."
219,Amber,Mar 18 at 5:27 AM,4,Stunning graphics!,"I'm trying out both Supernatural and FitXR to see which I like best so I'll be comparing the two. 

First things first, the graphics are phenomenal and the music is awesome! You can't beat them. The flow mode is also very fun for a light workout.  The things I wish they had were a multi-player function, and more different modes like FitXR has(HIIT, Dancing, etc). 

I would love to keep a subscription to both supernatural and fitXR but unfortunately I can't justify the $$$. This is a great game, but the FitXR classes fit my physical needs and goals more than supernatural, so I won't be renewing my subscription 🥺"
220,EmoCaveman,Dec 12 at 4:31 AM,5,My favorite and Most used VR game/ App,"The amount of content put into this app is insane, new playlist daily ! I get bad motion sickeness with most VR games but this one is so smooth it doesn’t bother me at all."
221,ZURI,Dec 21 at 5:27 AM,5,Life changing!,"It's fun, great music, great workouts, amazing coaches, and an amazing community in Facebook. I couldn't recommend this anymore!"
222,Ahlaynah D,Dec 4 at 8:11 PM,5,The best fitness app ever !,Great trainers ! Challenging work outs! And a wonderful community. If you add a food tracker and a BMI tracker 🙌🏽omg that would be a new level… Let’s go super natural family ❤️❤️❤️❤️
223,Marie,Jan 21 at 6:38 PM,1,Refund,"I do not want a subscription, I would like a refund of my purchase"
224,Adam Bagwell,Sep 18 at 4:59 AM,1,Free trial of 7 days is really 6 days,"Seems like a good app to see what it’s all about, but from the reviews this used to have a month trial.  Now it’s a 6 day trial until the needed 24 hour notice cancellation for the 7 days.  I cancelled my subscription 5 days in as I don’t appreciate these gotcha clauses in the trials to trick people into a paid subscription.  7 day trial should give you 7 days of a trial before you convert to a paid subscription.  But overall that is really too short for people to make a habit with an app.

Seems to have a lot of talking up front before starting the actual workout which is a bit tiresome and another reason I am cancelling."
225,706juice,Dec 7 at 6:22 AM,4,Good workout,"I absolutely love this app but there are so many things that can be done better. First, please allow us to be able to replay the song or start over. Allowing us to create a playlist of the songs would be great. Make sure all songs are available for all intensities, especially since it's $20 per month and PPPPLLLLLLEASE ADD MORE HIP HOP"
226,Crickle,Nov 15 at 1:33 AM,5,Favorite of all my games or apps.,"This is my absolute favorite game! I don't even mind the high monthly price point because the trainer's commentary has really helped me and it's like you're working out with another person. I've been using this at least 4 days a week since the end of June and I don't ever lack enthusiasm about my daily workout.

Most importantly, it is low impact and can be done by people with physical disabilities, but is still extremely challenging. I have dwarfism and had a lot of reconstructive joint surgeries, and I can keep up with a high intensity work out on a good day.  Recently they even included a one arm mode in the options. 

 I bet drummers would be good at this one. Haha!"
227,Xebdigon,Nov 25 at 5:27 AM,2,There are cheaper options out there,"I decided to try the game again with Focus Mode and I will say it is nice to be able to silence the trainers. Unfortunately, you have to set it every time, which makes it a bit tedious. Regardless, it's a nice add to finally have the ability. 

Thing is, it took a little too long for this feature to arrive.

I've personally moved on to other workout systems during the last year that are top-notch fun, awesome graphically, and don't have the issue trainers...they're a lot less expensive, too. Many of them allow me my own music as well, which is the cherry on top.

Hopefully it works out for others who have been waiting for this change!"
228,Suellenamyotte,Jan 18 at 8:23 AM,5,Love this app,"I absolutely love this app, my day is not complete until I play supernatural. Excellent work outs, excellent songs, excellent coaches."
229,Master Sgt Mary,Dec 15 at 12:43 AM,5,Love it but $,"I truly love this app but for almost $200 a year? No. If it was a bit cheaper, I'd keep it for sure but I just can't justify the cost."
230,JB,Dec 2 at 5:32 AM,5,Blown Away,"Shocked I say, shocked!! This is a good workout and realistic. My first vr set and it’s addictive. I highly recommend, easy setup and endless workouts in amazing locations with entertaining and encouraging coaches."
231,Kim,Dec 5 at 5:09 AM,4,Try it you'll like it!,"Currently on the 7 day trial.  My biggest issue currently is that I have no  peripheral vision in my left eye and am in fact 95% blind in that eye. This makes it challenging for games where I need peripheral vision. 

Even at 57 over weight and basically blind in one eye this app has enough levels that I am happy with it."
232,MekMek,Oct 11 at 5:17 AM,5,All I can say is give it a try.....,"I've enjoyed every minute that I've used Supernatural. I'm immersed in different locations that I could only imagine visiting. I cannot put the benefits into words, but I can jump in and out of a workout while rice is cooking for dinner. My daughter has other apps on this device, but she uses this one daily. My husband said he has never seen us move so much, and we go to the gym as a family three times a week. This is a supplement to our gym membership. When I was about to get this, I read the reviews, and the cost was a HUGE factor for most people. I equate the annual membership to a meal at Chic Fila. I am willing to skip the Chic Fila line to enjoy this type of body reimagining for the best version of myself."
233,Smitty,Nov 10 at 6:39 PM,5,Fantastic,"Have been enjoying Supernatural for awhile now.  Really enjoy the boxing element.  Good music, nice backdrops, coaches aren’t overly annoying.  

Updated: I should have looked a little deeper into the settings, as my only issue with the game was something that could be changed in the modifiers.  Now that I have found this, I don’t much have any other issues with the game. 

My original review that doesn’t matter anymore - 

(My one suggestion (and this is strictly for my own personal enjoyment as while I enjoy VR I have limited space to play) would be to create some programs that limit the amount you have to turn to the left and right. (If I stand in the middle of my play area, I am too close to obstacles on all 4 sides, so I back myself up closer to one wall so I have more space out in front of me). 
I know there are some good routines with limited turning, so maybe adding an identifier to each routine so players know how much they will be turning (45°, 180°, 360° etc) so they can pick programs suited to their play area.) 

Great experience."
234,AM2022,Nov 22 at 12:12 AM,5,Game changer for cardio workouts,"I hate running (and most cardio TBH) but Supernatural I adore. It's fun and challenging, and has improved my cardio fitness so much. My resting heart rate is now 56. They keep improving it, too. The newly added knee strikes are great."
235,KamikoJ,Nov 8 at 3:54 AM,5,So freaking fun!!!!,"I really enjoy this app! The scenery is gorgeous, the layout of the app is amazing, the music is . . .*chef's kiss*. And guess what! I LOVE the trainers. I did a workout today with Coach Dwana singing along to a song and giving helpful feedback and I absolutely loved it. As a newbie to fit apps, VR, and just fitness as a lifestyle in general, the coaches are helpful to me. They are also funny and engaging. Now, I do feel that there should be an option to mute the trainer for the people who would prefer just music. I understand that for some, it's make or break to them keeping the app. But personally, I love everything about this app right now."
236,Alisa,Nov 30 at 3:56 AM,3,Too expensive for what it is,"If I would be paying $180/yr for an app, it’s going to have every kind of fitness there is—especially yoga and dance. This is just a boxing app whose main selling point is the great places each workout takes place in. The stretching is a joke. They give you about one stretch for each “cool down” which is a super basic stretch I typically can’t even feel. I bought Body Combat instead which is a $20 flat fee and is the same thing but doesn’t have as many cool places."
237,Nykkye87,Dec 21 at 8:50 AM,1,Will not let me use the app or upgrade,You continue to charge me every month an app that don’t allows me to upgrade or use the app. Which doesn’t make any sense and won’t allow you to delete or get a refund. Horrible
238,WordPlayTre,13 days ago,3,It's cool but not worth the price.,If I'm going to pay this much I want more customization options and ability to cater workouts to my music choices. I see the appeal. The content is good but it's not $20/month good.
239,Tkhan0,Aug 4 at 9:21 AM,1,The developer response alone puts me off,"Honestly, this looks like a quite fun workout subscription, and as much as I would also balk at spending $15 - 20 a month (someone said for awhile the annual subscription was priced so that it was $12 or so a month- now thats a good deal!) The price is not that big a deal to me. 

What really puts me off from buying this service is the fake canned responses the devs seem to give valid complaints and feedback in these reviews. They seem thorough and thought out at first, but if you look for just a few minutes you will see many valid complaints and suggestions in the top reviews quickly dismissed by their ""developing team/partnerships/app structures"" or whatever else. They just seem so rigid about their app! Not willing to cater to their players whatsoever, but always end their responses requesting continued feedback. What is the point of feedback if youre just going to dismiss any suggestions as ""we cant really do that but thanks""??? They dont even give a good reason sometimes? What is stopping you from allowing a setting that disables instructor vo? How is your licensing song tracks preventing you from being able to allow players to skip songs? This isnt fricking spotify. I appreciate that the devs are even responding in the first place, but please rethink your response strategy. It isn't a good look.

A nice idea might be to start including a patch list somewhere in your app description that shows what new bugs youve fixed, or features youve added, with latest releases. You might even already have one! But the fact I cant find it means it's not accessible enough."
240,lili,Feb 13 at 5:25 PM,5,complete workout,"I was as skeptical like most of us, I saw the add on Instagram and right away downloaded and workout for an HR . I chose boxing but they offer  other workout as well . I love the music , the places , the target and flow of the  movements . It makes you feel good and it shows the end result at the end all the fitness points such as speed , frequency , accuracy . this is my gym now ."
241,Family,Nov 28 at 2:24 AM,3,Fun but flawed and pricey,"The few workouts I got in during the measly one week trial were awesome. However there are a couple things that are missing. If you realize you started the wrong workout there is no way to get back to the menu. You have to choose the whole program and restart. The other is the ability to turn off coaches comments. No need or want to hear their anecdotal family stories. Cheaper to have a gym membership too. I wish I could keep at it as it was fun, but it's just out of my price range.

Love that they addressed the muting trainers, but until the price goes down it's not worth it."
242,AexisScarbro,Dec 27 at 8:02 PM,5,"Best exercise, meditations and trainers","Best workout, full body and mind♡"
243,Ben Wangler,Jan 20 at 5:53 AM,1,NOT FREE,I never got to play the FREE game because it has a monthly or year round plan for REAL MONEY don’t be fooled.
244,Chris,Nov 4 at 5:27 PM,1,Rip off,"A $20 a month subscription fee to play a beat saber clone no thanks. Even if it were more reasonably priced I still wouldn't recommend it. It is a rhythm game with no sense of rhythm. It is constantly starting you up from motions but it does not complete, and having you move out of positions that it never put you into in the first place. Things like this are supposed to have a natural flow, and this just doesn't."
245,Choupy,Dec 28 at 9:17 PM,4,Available in Europe/France?,When do you think Supernatural will be available in Europe/France? I love this application and I can't launch it from France...
246,Knightrider,Jan 21 at 4:54 AM,1,Purchased,Why does it say I purchased this when I didn't
247,Phoenigma7,Nov 22 at 7:50 PM,4,Great App...But,"This is a great app for workouts with a really good song library to match. There's a lot that you can do on here. That being said, you can get the same workouts on other apps without having to have a subscription. The one major flaw is the trainer. For what you pay, there should be an option to mute the trainer during workouts. They are annoying!!!"
248,Ty,Dec 2 at 3:37 PM,1,Headache,This app is nearly impossible to cancel. I used it a few times but I prefer the gym. I tried to cancel so many times and they continue to charge. I had to call my bank to make a stop payment. I wouldn’t recommend this app to much of a nuisance.
249,Kowbellski,Nov 1 at 8:33 AM,5,Fantastic workout app-a few limitations,"I absolutely love this app. I actually enjoy the trainers during the warm up and cool down sessions. I love that I am working out to music I know and there are so many genres. 

They recently added knee lifts to the workouts and that gets you body moving in yet another fashion.

You can have free profiles for up to 4 total people on one headset. This is a huge plus if multiple people in your family want to use it. Unfortunately my family has 4 headsets rather than all sharing one headset so I don’t think I’d be able to use my subscription for all 4 members of the family :(

I currently have a free trial and am super sad it’s about to expire. $180 a year is unfortunately too much for me right now especially since it only offers sharing on the one headset. 

If your family shares a headset I highly recommend this app because it’s a heck of a work out and I always have fun and wish I were doing more of it."
250,Kam,Jan 28 at 10:13 PM,1,,Kinda sucks that you have to buy a trial
251,mimi,Jan 11 at 6:05 PM,3,??,Do I still have an account with supernatural?
252,Dark Helmet,Nov 13 at 5:40 PM,5,Great workout,If you don’t work up a sweat with supernatural you aren’t trying. I often get lost in the music and time seems to fly by. I do agree with some that the trainers are often annoying and unnecessary and keep them turned down
253,Kelly,Oct 28 at 9:15 PM,5,Great workout,"I am so pleased with the work out I'm getting, I've been working out for 3 weeks on the boxing and have lost 11 pds as well as inches. It is challenging but super fun and a great incentive from coaches and just competing with yourself to get a better score and  better performance.
The only thing I'm disappointed about is that I checked the box for the monthly payments and they took out the full amount with tax which was $195 and I'm 9n a fixed income so that has put me in a financial pinch."
254,MissValenciaTischinna,24 days ago,5,Apple Health compatible?,Not a review but a question. Is this compatible with Apple Watch/Apple Health?
255,Beamasam,12 days ago,1,Horrible game,I bought it for a month and then after I played it for two days￼￼ And it said I needed to spend more money…￼
256,Ariadneinthemaze,Aug 20 at 7:20 AM,5,Skeptic converted,"Enter SuperNatural. OMG…what…am I having…uh…fun?

I was never…NEVER…going to be one of those enthusiastic exercise mavens.  But in the last couple years, I made the decision to thrive — not dabble in health and vigor.  

I crawled my way into a daily regimen, finally working up to a half-hour on average, but dreading every minute of it. I’d distract myself with Netflix, podcasts, but still, it was a dutiful chore. I’ve had to restart several times, forcing myself back into a regular practice.

I’m here to witness — at 63, knee issues, hip surgery this fall, lifelong exercise-hater, unabashed obese woman — that I love…yes…LOVE exercising.  

I knew I had found what I had longed for when the app openned up and I was surrounded by the temple walls of Luxor, Egypt in 3D, a place I’ve only traveled to in my dreams. The targets flowed out of a portal towards me to a beat I could get lost in as I jabbled, undercut, crossed…and 20 minutes later, I was sweating and happy. Me, at the same time, both sweating and happy? 

Issues starting out: Music: I desperately required music I loved to distract me from what I was doing, but once in the groove, I found lots of choices in music genres, coaches, workouts, and simply — Joy: I step in…gone, lost in the flow.  Body Limits: after initial training sessions, I was able to adjust settings to my body, plus guidance from coaches and physical therapist helped on how to aggressively move without injury. 

Price: worth saving my life. I had set impossilbe goals. After a lifelong friend began to recover from a fatal diagnosis of Lupus through a change in diet, I began researching evidenced-based studies on health and nutrition; she pointed me to a non-profit foundation, nutritionfacts.org — following their recommendations, I figured out how to love food that can heal, but felt hopeless around the goal of an hour-and-a-half daily exercise. No longer. Thank you SuperNatural creators and coaches — your work is truly life-saving."
257,tlc2025,Oct 28 at 2:26 AM,5,By far the best workout ever,"I love this game. I hate working out and this has changed everything. They are constantly updating music, scenery, and now they are introducing a knee jab workout that is incorporated with their boxing or flow workouts. 

This is very much worth the membership and I'll be a member forever. I've had it now for about 4 months and constantly rush home to get a session in. 

I've never enjoyed anything this much, it's truly Supernatural ❤️"
258,TB,Dec 20 at 3:18 AM,5,Love it,Turns out they listen to feedback!
259,Michelle Fonzi,Jan 6 at 2:29 AM,4,Love it,"Love it, but would love it more if it was multiplayer!"
260,Symons,Oct 26 at 9:30 PM,5,Love this!,"I am not good at working out. If I feel like it's ""work"" I hate to do it and I stop very quickly. Supernatural is sooo much fun. I can feel the workout but I love doing it. The new update with knee raises is AMAZING! I am really getting the whole body workout! My only complaint would be that I wish we could pick a workout and then pick the level at which we want to perform. That way you could increase each workout as you improve. All in all I am happy with my purchase!"
261,Stefan,Nov 14 at 8:59 PM,5,Your future will thank you.,"This is the best app for Oculus. No question. This app turns working out into a fun activity that you look forward to doing every day. My life is fantastic, and Supernatural is the best part of my day."
262,You Wish,Oct 26 at 5:39 AM,5,Fun way to improve your fitness.,"I started using Supernatural 5 months ago and it has helped me get in better shape. The workouts are fun, the coaches are too. All the workouts take place in a different part of the world where most people will never see. There is a large variety of music so you should have no problem finding your favorite song. I have read other reviews where the price was mentioned as being too much but I don't agree. I have had gym memberships in the past and it costs me more with far less results. A tummy tuck costs a lot more than Supernatural."
263,MaVieBonne,Nov 5 at 9:40 PM,5,Awesome!,"I’m thrilled that there is now a much longer session and I hope there will be more. And I am hoping there will be more knee strikes, without the tutorial at the beginning. And any other challenges you come up with will be greatly appreciated!"
264,Kernel Korn,Nov 14 at 7:06 PM,2,What a shame,"I really love everything about this app/ game. It is very well done and love using it however there is no possible way it costs $25/month, per user to maintain this game. The greediness from the developers leaves a bad taste in my mouth. You may want to consider lowering the subscription cost. There are plenty of other workout options out there. Sorry, but I will go with one of the other options for my workouts."
265,Erin,Nov 29 at 12:21 AM,5,Good fitness game...,It's a good fitness game. I just don't have the money to pay for it anymore. How do I cancel my subscription?
266,Lexibelle,Oct 21 at 7:54 AM,5,Exercise that speaks to this gamer,"I've been working out with Supernatural now for 10 months.  I loved it so much that I bought my own headset so I wasn't having to schedule around our son's.  

The flow workouts are great if you want to feel graceful or maybe a little ninja-like while you're swinging bats around.  Boxing is perfect for stress relief and anger management. 

The trainers and community are really what make this special though. Unlike a lot of other subscriptions type workouts,  you feel like you're part of something.  You feel seen.  You feel heard.  You feel like you belong."
267,Kerrie,Nov 22 at 9:16 AM,4,How I Feel About Super Natural,"Well I’ve been enjoying it when I have energy and time, but what I don’t understand is that your offering people who join up for a years subscription and they get a free map, I wasn’t offered anything for joining , that disappoints me."

273,Amber Armstrong,Jan 24 at 4:25 AM,5,Just purchased & I’m already in LOVE,"First off, let me say I literally just purchased this app. Did the trial went through the little beginning workout/tutorial and I’m already swapping to the full membership within not even￼ 15 to 20 minutes. I wish I would’ve just done it when I got my oculus around Christmas time because I would’ve already lost weight and canceled my gym membership. I get a better work out in the comfort of my own home without having to leave drive across town find an outfit or something that matches Atlees worry about my hair the weather the time I can literally wake up work out, shower and go about my day and do the same at night, this saves me so much time money gas just everything especially trying to convince my daughter to go into the gym daycare while I workout that’s been the real hassle because I get up early every morning and she never wants to get up so she’s fussy when I take her to the gym and will cry until I just give up go home until later which as we all know means I just end up not working out ￼because driving once was a struggle enough I’m not driving that far again. This app saved my life now I can workout while she’s asleep and have my entire day free to not have to say I have to make sure I have time to run to gym before it gets dark. If I’m bored I can literally just hop on my oculus and do a few fun workouts. The scenery is absolutely beautiful and makes it just that much more fun not to mention the music￼￼ FINALLY an app with REAL MUSIC AND NEW MUSIC not that elevator doctors office music that makes it more of a dread than a fun workout. Well now that I’ve rambled on and my review has been all over the place I really hope if you’re feeling uncertain that you will just at least try it out it’s worth EVERY single bit of your time and for the price it’ll change your life a little $19 a month when you save so much time money stress of traveling to the gym. Good luck and Well Wishes to everyone on there road to loving themselves again, you’ll get there keep your head up and your heart open ☺️"
274,wade,Jan 19 at 8:28 PM,1,Not worth a gym membership.,"This is honestly priced over what it is worth. I am not a fan of the SaaS model, and especially at the current price point. These developers do not understand how many more users they could pick up for even half the price on a monthly basis.
You can find other apps and games that are very similar to the different workout types on here that are a one-time payment or even free! That way, you will be able to enjoy your content and workouts forever!"

278,Luke,Oct 15 at 2:26 AM,5,Great workout! Only 1 recommendation,I love this workout but would love it if you could customize your workouts by choosing songs and forming your own playlists. I enjoy the intensities. But wish I could do some medium and then hard workouts but not do the entire section. Otherwise it’s an awesome app! And something different than my other workouts.
279,Cynexia,Oct 15 at 12:30 AM,5,hesitant no longer,"I'm hesitant to give this app a go. I am physically disabled, i cannot comfortably stand for more than 15 minutes at a time. Is there a difficulty setting for those of us who want to work out to loose weight but are incapable of doing a normal work out routine?

Revision: I’ve been doing Supernatural for a month now. I have disabilities so I thought that this might be out of my league. Turns out I was wrong. I do this once a day ( sometimes twice) it’s a great way to get up and moving. And while I am experiencing pain in my back I’m hoping that with tenacity this will pass. Unable to do anything over 20 minutes at this time but it’s worth it . I recommend this app to anyone with mobility issues. 


Suggestion: I set a seven day goal, however when I have outside things ( like grocery shopping) by the time I’m home I’m to exhausted and in pain to do my workout. My idea is for us to be able too add a task to our goals so that we don’t feel like losers who didn’t get their goal for the day met?

281,dman,Aug 31 at 1:35 AM,3,"Fun, but not much of a workout","The boxing is fun, can be somewhat challenging on high intensity, but does present much of a challenge if you’re even mildly fit. It’s a fun and quick break to get you moving, but that’s about it. 

I would give it 4 stars, but I took off a star because many of the trainers are absurdly annoying. I’m trying to enjoy the music and get into a rhythm, and every 5 seconds I hear this screeching voice saying silly and pointless things. I’m fine with comments once in a while, but every 5 seconds is just too much. And I’ve found no way to turn them off."

283,Alicia,Oct 5 at 11:59 PM,1,Developers listen! Make this better!,"I see so much potential, but the developers need to listen to the reviews and give us a product that is actually worth the cost of the membership. It is held back by its poor user interface and surprising lack of customization. Most glaringly - the inability to turn off the trainer voices! 

The movements, visuals and scenery are all pretty solid, but the music/songs are the main driver for people to use this app in particular. We shouldn’t pay for an expensive membership and still have every single song overwhelmed by the repetitive trainer audio. You can turn down the trainer audio, but only by about half, and you definitely still hear the trainers over/through the music. I can understand requiring the trainer audio for the first time you do a workout, however it gets really annoying to hear the same narration every single time. Developers could even make turning off the trainer audio into an unlock-able option after you achieve a certain % or something! 

There is also no option to build your own workout playlists or to choose one specific song at a time. The interface isn’t the most intuitive, and I wish the user experience was more customizable with an individualized home page, etc.

I paid for an annual membership unintentionally because I forgot about the free trial ending. For this price point, and as a subscription based service, the functionality and features need to be improved.

I would absolutely consider this a 5 star app if we could simply mute the trainers."

I tried cancelling something like 2 months ago with the phone app, but it said because I subscribed through the Oculus I had to cancel on that. So I did, it even said the subscription was cancelled. Last month I saw the charge but thought the charge was for a new app I purchased. This month I see the same charge,  but I have not purchased anything. So I go and redownload the app just to find out they never cancelled my subscription. Try to cancel on oculus again but this time it says I have to cancel though the app. So I do, and again it says subscription cancelled. Let's see if this one works.

 1. There is a really annoying bug when trying to skip the warmup.  Almost every time I try to skip the warmup, the next song will either start with the warmup song or no song at all!  
2. The ability to save a song and create my own routine or the ability to skip songs.  Do I want to workout to three songs that I dislike just to get to one that I do like?  No...
3. A search engine to look up songs/artists.
4.The ability to turn off the coach commentary.
5. I'm going to have to agree with almost all the reviews...the cost."

I LOVE Supernatural! It’s 100% exercise, but never feels like it.  I can’t explain the experience. It’s like being part of the music, and the bats/boxing gloves/targets are your instruments, voice, and percussion.  You can be very expressive with it. 

There are new workouts every day, and many of the workout songs are so fun to play to that you’ll absolutely want to play the same workouts again.  You’ll never get bored with it. 

Don’t kid yourself - this app will make you sweat, and you WILL ACHE lol, but I see a huge difference in my upper body after just five weeks with Supernatural!! 

There are also fantastic social media groups you can join. I’m actually currently in a SN tournament in one Facebook group and heading to semi-finals!! ❤️ 

You need this game if you like to work out to music you actually know and like. Lots of SLAMMIN’ tunes. Do. It."
304,Jouddy,Nov 26 at 5:34 PM,3,Good game BUT,Pretty good game but too expensive. I don’t think there should be a subscription for the game. A one time fee should be enough.

309,King Gage,Jul 7 at 2:41 AM,4,Beats going to a toxic gym environment,"I absolutely hate working out unless I'm doing an activity or a sport (ex: basketball, baseball, volleyball) of some kind.  On top of that the gym community has became extremely toxic.  I don't need ignorant remakes or people who think they own the gym and get angry about their stupid TIK TOK videos (shout out to Joey Swoll).  My only complaint is sometimes the physics don't register correctly.  Who wants a streak of 1000 plus ruined because my uppercut didn't register when I clearly through the proper punch and speed?  Sometimes the bats disappear when you get to close to the barrier.  Every second counts.  I understand its more about getting in shape but like I said before I don't like just to workout.  Supernatural makes it feel like more of game so when this stuff happens its really frustrating.  I try to beat my ""high score"" every time I'm on and can't when simple mistakes like this happen.

P.S.  For everyone complaining about the price.  You need to put things in perspective.  It's only $14.99 a month.  Think about this way.  One pizza a month is over $15.  3 to 4 of your beloved Starbucks coffee is over $15 a month.  A 12 pack of beer or a few cocktails at the bar cost over $15.  Any popular high tier streaming services or cable packages are over $15 a month.  I always hear people complain about spending money when it comes to their health but have no problem dropping money on any of this stuff I mention above.  I've been this person and I'm try everyday to have a different mind set.  You spend your money on what your priority's are.  

Cheers!"
310,SpiritFinder,Sep 24 at 4:27 AM,5,A year in review,"A year later-I still workout with Supernatural at least 3 times a week so it has been money well spent. I love the coaches, And their feedback in workout-while generic-is spot on. When they say to keep my shoulders down, I do and then realize I was in fact starting to round my back and shoulders. Having them cheering “me” and saying positive words celebrating me and my progress and my commitment to showing up each day really does keep me motivated. 

The music is continually updated and added so there is not only always something I like there is often something new that fits my tastes as well. 

New workouts are added daily which it has kept it fresh. 

The added boxing is great.

I love “series” workouts and Imagine Dragons is still on my frequently played list.

I love the involvement with the community and the addition of community members becoming guest coaches. 

All in all money well spent-to the point I’m still spending a year later and finding it worth it. My IRL gym membership on the other hand…."

312,Wolfie,Sep 23 at 6:57 AM,5,Awesome,"I love this app. I was never one of those people that thought this would be a decent fitness app--I just like hitting things for stress relief (and this app gives you 2 options to do that, lol). I'm not a fitness buff, I don't exercise or play sports for fun, and I don't fad diet or any of that crap. 

And now I love --and I mean LOVE--to exercise. This is the only way I really like to exercise but yeah, I love it. 

But it turns out that this IS a fitness app--an extremely addictive fitness app. I've lost a couple of inches and I'm much healthier and toned. It's crazy bc I'd actually kind of made some peace with the size I was at  and then boom, Supernatural. LIke I said, I love this app. I recommend it to family and friends. I can take little 10 minute quick-hit breaks--especially after really frustrating meetings--and blow off some steam, then hop right back into work refreshed and ready to go. 

Yep, this is a subscription. A lot of people complain about that--I say look at what you're getting: minimum 2 new workouts daily, all workouts designed to get wholesale results, and music that isn't remakes (and offers more options than just EDM). Plus my health insurance reimbursed me for all but $20 of the annual subscription. The product itself is just great quality. Beatsaber doesn't come anywhere close to giving me the results (or satisfaction) that this app does. Some people are just going to complain no matter what. 

So yeah, try the app. Go on reddit to get one of the 30-day-free-trial coupons (we each get like 5 per month). There's a pretty decent chance you're going to love it too."
313,Kesselia,Jun 14 at 6:45 AM,5,Supernatural vs Beatsaber,"I bought the VR headset to get more excercise, but I had no intentions of buying any additional expensive software or hardware- the headset was pricy enough. Based on the ads, it seemed Supernatural and Beatsaber were pretty much the same thing. 
They. Are. Not.
The premise is the same, yes, but the application is entirely different. I don't care about cool environments and coaches, I just wanted to burn calories. With Beatsaber, it took getting to hard level just to break a sweat. With Supernatural, I'm still on short, low level, and I sweat and lunge and stretch and burn everytime with no injury or pain. And there are so many choices! I am not getting bored as I feared.

In short, Beatsaber is a game with a little movement built in. Supernatural is a workout with a game built in.  
Worth every penny. I haven't played Beatsaber since I got Supernatural."

The only thing I wish was different is the meditation. I like it a lot, I just wish it was a longer meditation and then after the meditation is done that it allows you to sit, breathe, and enjoy the scenery before exiting. Maybe even adding music.

326,Gocorona,Oct 4 at 4:17 AM,4,Amazing - add option to mute coaches,"Ok, great app. I have been using this for 1.5 months and I have never wanted to come home from work and work out. Never. Now I actually look forward to it. The stress relief from a boxing / flow workout really destresses and changes my mood. Also, with some diet changes and this app, I am down 18 pounds. Weight loss has never been this easy. I literally have to limit my workout sessions to a couple a day. Crazy right?  

Now for the reason I didn't give the app 5 stars. The option to mute the coaches commentary REALLY needs to be added. Don't get me wrong, I love most of the coaches and they do give good tips time to time to help me realize my form is off or I need to focus on certain body parts / actions. But after a few sessions the canned commentary really gets old and detracts from the workout. For new workouts, I listen to the coaches for the first couple of times. After that, it gets irritating and I don't find myself in the zone, listening to the music and working out. Please, please listen to your paying customers and add this option."

Supernatural has all of those move-your-body activities, too, and truthfully have designed those tasks better than most of the competition. But that’s table stakes. Where this game really shines is the positive energy and guidance given by the coaches at the beginning of and throughout each of the exercise adventures. ￼The coaches are relentlessly positive and come across as genuinely cool, and I have found that even when I’m beginning and can’t keep up yet, the coaches attitude makes it impossible for me to be down on myself. ￼It really is like having your own personal trainer. This game is totally worth the annual subscription price!"

333,SeriousBellZ,Oct 2 at 1:29 AM,3,Fun and effective…but,"I’m nearing the end of my one year subscription and I’ve enjoyed the overall aspect of the workouts, updates and trainers. However, as you progress and dial in your routine, it becomes very distracting with the ongoing and repetitive coaching for many of the routines I typically enjoy. It would be great to mute or disable the coaching aspect now that I’ve worked up my abilities within the game. This is an ongoing request by many seasoned players and nothing from the developers regarding why or when such an option is/ isn’t enabled. I won’t be renewing my subscription going forward as I’ve found several other, non subscription based games that are just as effective and enjoyable as supernatural that allow for fluid gameplay, movement, music and rhythm without the distraction of someone talking in the background. While I would be inclined to give 4-5 stars for the game, 1 would be for listening to your subscribers (which it seems you aren’t) and take into consideration that capability of muting trainers, the other for the excessive cost of the subscription. I’ll continue to look for updates to the app and gameplay, however, it will be removed once my subscription has been expired. Thank you developers for the enjoyment to this point, all the best to the coaches and staff that brought the game this far."

337,Bikvi Sibro,Aug 4 at 11:42 PM,5,Supernatural is Awesome!!!!!,"I am not even sure where to start on this. I use Supernatural while also dieting, and walking. I love the activities of boxing and flow so much. Using this as part of my routine, I have almost lost 50 pounds.

If you manage to keep up with using the app on a consistent basis, you will see improvement. I was barely able to do light intensity workouts unless it was the short ones, and now I can do the 20+ minute medium intensity ones and still pushing to get better.

I know for some, the coaches commentary is distracting but I actually enjoy it. Yes, it's pre-recorded but some of the things they say are hilarious and gets me out of my own head to enjoy the workout more. Even though she was a guest coach, Shea Couleé was awesome and had me cracking up. Plus they have a lot of music genres and great tracks on here which just adds to the fun as sometimes I find myself dancing a little while working out to the track.

One thing to cover is the price. At first glance, yes the price does seem steep, but keep in mind that the subscription pays for them to make more workouts to keep us interested and going. I can only imagine the costs of designing the workouts, paying the coaches, doing the recordings, licensing the music, and then putting it all together into the app.

TLDR: Works well as part of a workout and diet routine. Keep using it consistently to improve. The coaches are great to listen to along with the music. The cost seems bad until you realize the upkeep that goes into keeping the app running and getting new workout material."
338,Jason,Jul 5 at 5:06 AM,5,Addictive and fun,"A lot of people are complaining about the price, etc., but at the end of the day, you get what you pay for. Think about it, it would be different if it was the same routines, etc., but Supernatural is constantly adding workouts, and just recently added Katy Perry (both workouts are phenomenal!) and more new artists to follow. 

Also, they just updated where you can search for artists. I know the gripes are that you can’t skip songs or create your own playlist, but I’m pretty sure those will be addressed in the future. 

The coaches are motivating and keeps me going. I’ve been doing Supernatural for a month now and I’m definitely seeing results in my physique. I’m 46 and going from a dad bod back to how I looked when I was active duty in the military 25 years ago! I feel fantastic and motivated!

Other than that, I’m definitely addicted. Supernatural makes cardio fun and prior to Supernatural, I had a boxing setup in my garage, but Supernatural gives cardio that extra spice to keep me on the hook! 

In my opinion, the price is worth it if you’re consistent with working out. Supernatural will continue to get better with updates and new artists. It seems like they listen to their buyers and are trying to improve the app constantly."
339,Jezika Pitas,Sep 28 at 8:17 PM,4,Great overall,"I really enjoy the workouts and music compilations. They are fun and not at all monotonous making exercise something to look forward to. I do wish that there was an option that turns off squats and  ducks and replaces them with blocks as seen in other programs. I have to adjust the settings to avoid squats and dips as they contribute to feelings of motion sickness for me which happens using VR. However, I feel like I’m getting less of a workout as a result. Therefore I give 4 stars instead of 5 as this is a valuable feature that leads me to gravitate towards an alternate program."
340,Kim C,Sep 7 at 4:54 AM,5,Getting back on track with this app,"Was doing well at the gym and then Covid hit.

Supernatural is definitely it. Love the coaches, all of them. Very motivating feels like they’re in the room with you. It’s cheaper than a personal trainer and￼ the scenery is breathtaking.  Thank you for this.￼"
341,JAM,Sep 29 at 9:50 AM,3,Absolutely love it BUT,"I absolutely love this. It’s the best app out there for training BUT… its way too pricey. Should have at least a free option where we only buy the app. Absolutely not paying that much every month or even once a year. Yeah gym would cost more but it’s an app , not a gym with all the same cost of operation and things around that. Would give 5 stars and even more but that’s it"
342,April,Jan 5 at 8:12 AM,4,Fun and enjoyable,This is a fun workout game it’s only my first day using the trial.  I like it so far. But I have one complaint. Where is the option for subtitles for deaf players? When the coaches are talking I had no clue what they were saying but I finally figured out how to play the flow game.   It would be nice to have an option to turn subtitles on or off. Plus one question will there be color options for the flow besides black and white?
343,Ailís,Oct 30 at 6:04 AM,1,I don’t want to see virtual trainers,I don’t want to see the virtual trainers. I’m not playing this to look at them. I playing to work on myself. And the trainer is distracting.
344,Cassie Lou,Sep 17 at 6:26 PM,5,I am addicted to Supernatural!,"It is difficult for me to stop after one workout…I usually do two or three! I feel like my waist is returning, and I have more energy. I am 68, and get so bored with Senior classes at the gym. I am never bored with Supernatural!"
345,Hailey,Jan 2 at 6:23 AM,4,Great,"It’s a great way to work it. It is so addictive which makes it easy to stick to the routine. Highly recommend. It truly is a whole body workout and I finish sweating and feeling the burn. So happy about this app! 

One huge suggestion I do have is adding multiplayer. I would love to invite my friends and workout with them on screen as well!"
346,Sarah Elizabeth Marquez,Feb 17 at 6:56 PM,1,Can’t Even Sign Up,Won’t let me sign up so I just purchased for nothing
347,IAMAMARRIEDWOMANRESPECTME,Jun 11 at 11:45 PM,1,You guys need to have an affordable pric,"The reason why I won't get supernatural, because it's too expensive. With the way everything going on with the economy everyone can't afford $19.99 a month. I believe you guys need to do what Lesmills Bodycombat VR  and fitxr did when it first came out. I only paid the one time $29.99. You guys really need to consider that. Yes they have real coaches as well. But are affordable, and more people are going to them. I liked yall in the beginning last year, but was really hoping yall had a one time payment for those that chose to do that..please listen to the ones that are telling you, you guys are too expensive and I can't afford you."
348,메타쩡마니,Nov 7 at 6:15 PM,3,Question to Supernatural,I am one Korean. I really want to use this Supernatural. Do you have any plans to serve in Korea?
349,Megaram505,Nov 6 at 7:14 PM,1,🤦‍♀️,Please(show me how to) remove this from my notifications. Please (show me how to)remove this from my headset.
350,Batmom,Jan 17 at 6:06 AM,5,Love this so much,"Hoping it goes on sale before my 7 day trial is over. 

I got my sil to do this with me. Wish us luck!"
351,Lysee,Sep 23 at 7:24 AM,5,Reach out to coach for guidance,I have tried countless times and ways to simply leave questions for some of the coaches but never receive anything back from them. I really think a little communication would be helpful.
352,Ryan,Sep 19 at 6:44 PM,4,Great workouts,"I find some workouts I keep going back too. I wish there were a few longer high intensity boxing workouts. They cap out a t about 20 mins. If I could recommend anything it would be the ability to make a playlist of sorts, I mean like pick 2-3 workouts so they play back to instead of finishing, then looking for my next workout. I usually like to do 2-4 workouts at a time to get about an hour or so. But there’s downtime between programs while I search for the next workout."
353,Khari,Aug 29 at 6:16 AM,5,Supernatural is Life-Changing!!!,"This is my first time ever writing a review for an app. Supernatural has been life changing for me! I’ve lost almost 30 pounds in less than two months and I feel healthier and stronger than I have in years. I use the app everyday and the morning workouts really get me going. This app has the best coaches, music and scenery out of any other workout app. It’s definitely worth the subscription!"
354,Mady,Sep 17 at 2:36 AM,1,Careful with this app,I canceled my subscription 4 months ago. They still are charging me every month for the app. It only appears on my credit card and not on my pay pal. I already communicated with oculus support who’s been useless so far. I’ve been charged twice and now I would have to call my credit card to report a fraud from supernatural. That’s the only way to stop the monthly subscription.
355,Kim,Sep 18 at 4:14 AM,3,Loading issues,"Overall, I love this app...when it works. I have loading issues about 40 % of the time. I know it's not my Internet since I have no issues with any other app. It's very frustrating when you're in the middle of a workout. I also wish that there was a way to skip songs or at least resume a workout that was previously unfinished. My dream is that we could curate our own playlist out of available workouts. I do love the coaches and the choreography is really good."
356,Leslie F,Jan 4 at 1:34 AM,2,Basically Beat Saber and Body Comba,"If you have Beat Saber and Les Mills Body Combat, you already have what Supernatural has to offer. It's pretty and seems legit. However it's subscription based. No need for me to pay monthly or yearly if I already have other games that do the exact same thing."
357,Floresence,Jul 26 at 11:35 PM,1,Hate this App,Do not like the exercises or instructors.  Have gone into App and it show I am not subscribed but have been billed $20.37 a month for the last 4 months.  Cannot contact anyone to get this straightened out.  Will have to go through my bank.  Be cautious before signing up for the trial offer.  I feel scammed
358,Vixxx,Sep 17 at 1:01 AM,2,Super natural subscription 🙄🤦,"The game has many different workouts for all ..good variety of music options and instructed workouts with great scenery. 
HOWEVER..the monthly subscription is what is it for me .
Why is there no option to purchase for one flat rate?
This world has enough scammers and price gougers stop being greedy with your monthly subscription fees!
For this reason I unsubscribed and will encourage others to do so as well.
Disappointing..I really enjoyed this game but refuse to pay subscription fees of $20x12 months = $240+ per year..SHAME ON YOU GUYS!😤🤬🤦😤"
359,Luis El Chamo,Oct 23 at 6:29 AM,2,Cancelation problem,I cancelled the subscription a long time a go and you still billing me every single month please solve this problem
360,S. Logan,Oct 27 at 10:28 AM,1,Crap,I have tried for hours to subscribe and it won't let me no matter what I do. I'm done. Uninstalled.
361,Alisha,Aug 23 at 11:12 AM,5,Surpassed my expectations!,I did the 14 day trial with every intention of canceling at the end. But I am so in love with this app; it makes working out so easy and fun. The ability to customize the music with the type of workout you’re doing is remarkable. I find myself working out more because I am not thinking of it as a work out. But then I look down and my heart rate is through the roof! I can tell that a lot of thought and effort went in to this app. The trainers are amazing!￼ I truly feel like the workouts are customized for me. You have to try it!￼
362,Tigre bélier 08,Oct 18 at 6:04 AM,2,Price,"I'm from Canada, and is to  expensive, with the dollars exchange, im never sure what will be my monthly charges, this is a over charged experience..."
363,Margie Mae,Aug 7 at 4:13 AM,5,"Fun, motivating, and addicting","A friend talked me into getting a VR system specially for this app.  I resisted, then I tried it and was like…OH, I get it now.  

So I got the VR system and this app, and am very happy I did.  I am pretty new to it, but I really like the coaches and find myself looking forward to getting my workouts in.  It’s fun and I am always coming out of it sweating.  I just need to figure out how to keep the sweat from running into my headset lens and blurring things.

The only thing I guess I think could be changed is a few points for stretch/meditation.    I haven’t encountered any glitches.

To me, the price is fair and worth it, I appreciate the new daily content and the variety of places, workouts, and songs."
364,elle,Aug 21 at 9:58 PM,5,Love love,I can’t say enough about how much I’ve enjoyed working out more and using supernatural. I’ve been on a mission to close my rings every day (Apple Watch) and I am on week 3 of closing all my rings. Mostly bc I’m burning calories like no other on this app. I love the songs and feel like I’m getting a solid workout. I just want the silicon face band to be back in stock bc I definitely get the O face after every workout. Oculus face. Can’t wait for more songs to join the program!
365,Heriseldom,Jul 24 at 10:07 PM,1,Unsubscribed due to price and EU block,"For 19$/month I expect a supposedly portable VR system to work no matter where I am physically. Country blocks on the use of the app defeat the purpose of a portable cardio system for precisely for some of the people who need such a system, for example, those who have to travel very frequently and so they cannot join an actual gym to go to regularly. Lack of app functionality in the EU has been brought up more than 6 months ago and I didn’t cancel because I thought this will be addressed, but it hasn’t. 


If I’m in the EU, I can’t even use my own music in the background while playing, if music license restrictions were the issue, that could be one alternative that would make the app overall more accessible. Instead I just have a lame message on the screen to look at saying app not usable in this country. come on facebook, It’s 2022…"
366,Vanessa,Oct 14 at 12:21 AM,1,Trying to unsubscribe it wont let me,I bought this with the subscription. Idk how to unsubscribe. It's not for me and keeps charging me 18.99 a month. Help!!!! I've never even played it cause I physically can't !
367,JessieDreamTeamZ,Sep 12 at 10:32 PM,2,Accidentally charges after cancellation,"I canceled my membership because it was just too expensive as a monthly membership and would prefer if it was a one time purchase with add on’s like Beat Saber which I love. After canceling I played until the end of the month because that’s usual with most cancellations. But what I didn’t realize was I resubscribed because I logged in through the website 😅. One of the big issues I have is that is very easy to accidentally resubscribe or not actually be canceled by simply logging in and they don’t send you monthly statements or notifications. I paid for 7 months without realizing. It’s also hard to unsubscribe and you have to do it through the website and it can be confusing. I never logged in or use the service. After many emails I only got my current months bill back and two months free. It’s better than nothing put still annoying.   I wish I could of gotten back all the months I missed because I did unintentionally paid for it and never used it and they’re able to see that. Just be careful that you make sure your actually unsubscribe from the service (through the website) if you cancel and don’t re-login, it’s easier to do close to the next billing cycle. Make sure to check your back account the next month."
368,Bigsarge,Oct 9 at 12:09 AM,5,BRAHH!!!,"Love the workouts, this definitely gets your heart rate up & running."
369,Aron G.,Oct 8 at 4:38 AM,1,"So you can charge but not play, nonsense","Im outside the US, you let me activate the subscription but i cannot play because im outside the US. Well thats stupid. What is the matter if im outside??? I can pay anyway!!"
370,JJ McGraw,Jan 2 at 8:45 AM,4,Excited to get started,Hello: I've been reading the post and excited to get things rolling. I see that it will be a great way to stay in shape and have a great time doing it. When I get it I will give everyone updates.
371,Jessica W,"May 16, 2022 at 9:52 PM",1,Would be amazing if it was affordable,"I loved the demo! I wasted it so bad until I looked at the price! I already payed $300 of the headset and much more for other games. I wanted the headset so I can work out more. Even with the annual cost it’s still $15 a month. I’ve seen so many people complain about this to, this much money is just not reasonable for many people who would actually love to have this game. And I’m sure if you lower the cost many more people will join and you will make even more money. It’s horrible that I want this game so bad but I can’t afford it and many other people are in the same situation. I personally know at least 30 others in this exact situation."
372,Ryan,Dec 28 at 3:46 AM,5,Awsome,This app is amazing definitely worth the subscription price I love this my favorite and only fitness go to
373,Ashsny23,Aug 17 at 6:26 PM,4,Great workout from home,"I love this app, I recommend it to all my friends. I’ve never really been one to workout but this app makes it so easy to want to. Like many apps it does have its pros and cons. I’ll start with the price before I head into the pros/cons. A lot of people don’t really think of the bigger picture when they’re paying for a subscription. Instead of going to a gym and paying more for a membership and personal trainer, supernatural brings that all to you in the comfort of your own home! You’re subscription is just a small fraction of what you’d pay for with a personal trainer, gym membership, and the gas to get there. With that being said, like any job, supernatural has employees to pay. From the developers to the coaches and everyone in between as well as the licensing for the music they provide. 

Pros-
-Cheaper than a gym and personal trainer
-The comfort of working out at home
-you choose your level of difficulty 
-good selection of music 

Cons-
-not able to make your own play list
-not able to skip songs 

Suggestions-
-I prefer the bats over boxing, it would be nice to choose a playlist that lets you choose which one you’d rather do, as well as a setting that lets you choose your playlist with whichever speed you’re comfortable with. Since some songs/artists are only available with certain difficulties and the choice of bats or boxing. 
-the ability to turn off coaches
-a setting that lets you choose if you want to do squats/triangles."
374,Marie White,Jan 13 at 5:28 AM,1,Grrr,Why are there no big huge options for cancelling the subscription? How irritating! It should be just as easy to unsubscribe.
375,Karlile,Oct 20 at 9:34 AM,2,Great but too expensive,I had fun but I consider for a workout platform is too expensive
376,Aiden,Oct 8 at 3:55 AM,5,Best game ever it changes my life,I’ve never excersized and enjoyed it before.
377,Purple,Jan 17 at 3:36 AM,1,Money,Basically beat saber but you need to pay a monthly subscription to even play for a little.
378,Finley Kenyon,Dec 26 at 10:26 PM,2,Not amazing,"When I first got my VR I put in my email, password, and paired it. It worked out fine. But I when I started to play this game, it said my email was invalid. I deleted the app after trying one to many times."
379,Steve,Aug 9 at 5:39 AM,5,"Fantastic, highly recommended!","Never thought I’d really do cardio again at this level. As a former collegiate athlete, I swore off running and could never get into stationary exercise equipment as it’s too boring and repetitive. I enjoy walking but it’s not challenging enough. Found Supernatural and haven’t looked back. One of the best purchases I’ve made (Oculus and Supernatural).  I actually like cardio now and have fun doing it! Low level hypertension resolved and no need for meds. As a neurologist I also see the brain training benefits with this activity with motor coordination/planning for long term brain/cognitive health. Love the coaching and music choices.  Thank you to the team and Keep those workout coming Supernatural!"
380,Kotaree,Aug 9 at 3:26 AM,5,AMAZING,"I love the supernatural app! I actually look forward to getting off work and working out lol. Thus far, it has been the only thing that I can really stick to for longer than a week. I have so much fun, love the music, and love the destination workouts. Definitely worth the money, it is even less than a gym membership in my town!"
381,HappyFox,Sep 21 at 12:03 AM,4,Workout Intensity,"I love the app and the workouts. You have L, M and H workouts kind of mixed together. Would it be possible to be able to select a workout by intensity and it show you only those workouts?"
382,Cc,Sep 24 at 2:28 AM,5,Thank you Supernatural Team!,This experience is amazing. Thank you so much Supernatural Team.
383,Misscryss,Sep 8 at 10:27 PM,2,Fun but not worth the money,Not worth the money. Not a lot of good songs and a lot of repeats. Coaches are annoying 😂 idk if you can mute them or not. Every once in awhile I pay for a month and play but I would never pay for a whole year or keep paying monthly.
384,Joe Amadeus,Aug 25 at 10:31 PM,4,Great improvements,"I’ve had Supernatural for almost a year now. The app is a great workout. I can burn anywhere between 100-350 calories with oculus move tracking and that’s impressive for this game. 

I do have some suggestions though: 

1. Slow down the boxing workouts, and do what Les Mills does with the repetitious reps. Les Mills boxing feels better and more in tune. Supernatural’s boxing workouts feel more chaotic and I can’t tell if that’s by design or if the game is just trying to give us a good song rendition. 

2. Make the startup animation faster or skipable. Loading it every day and watching the same animation gets really tedious. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great and pretty, but when you’ve opened it over and over again for a year, watching the same opening intro, it gets old fast. 

Other than that, Supernatural is great! The app is fantastic. The introduction of Mindy, a new boxing trainer is really cool. It’s weird to think of a literal person as a feature update, but what Supernatural is doing it right! 

Thank you!"
385,Hutch,Aug 25 at 10:43 PM,4,"Love it, but internet won't support it","I love this app! Love the workouts! They're fun and interactive, music is great.  I actually really like the trainer commentary - it makes it feel like I'm in a live class. 
HOWEVER, I had to cancel the subscription because our slow, rural internet just can't keep up and I couldn't get through a whole workout without it freezing multiple times.  If there were an option to download workouts, it would help.  Someday if that option becomes available, or we get faster internet, I'll be back.
The only other complaint is that I sweat a lot with the headset on, but I'm sure eventually they'll have lighter headsets."
386,Shane,Dec 23 at 8:26 AM,5,,"An absolutely amazing app, this is by far the best boxing simulation I’ve ever experienced"
387,Oliviabrody,Sep 20 at 7:49 PM,1,Not working,What’s going on? It’s telling me it needs an update. I did it and it won’t open. I use this app more than any other one. I need some help here please!
388,Kyam8,Jun 24 at 3:55 AM,1,Horrible App!!,"I downloaded this app for my brothers and I to workout, we pooled together our money and selected the Annual Subscription. When we went to each add our own profile it would not let us and tried to set up three separate accounts all paying to use it monthly! What’s the point of allowing 4-5 profiles if each one costs almost $200 a year???"
389,Vanessa Lewis,Jul 18 at 10:50 PM,4,Almost ideal…,I just finished my one week trial and I’m loving the workouts. EXCEPT—I’ve always been the type that gets motivated by specific songs and was slightly disappointed that I can not make a play list or skip songs. I hope with all the comments regarding this in the community that this is updated soon!!

How do I fix this issue"
392,Bennett,Aug 1 at 3:22 AM,5,More Boxing Workouts PLEASE!,"Supernatural is the reason I’ve logged onto my Peloton account only a handful of times since the day I got my Oculus (Dec. 25, 2021). The boxing workouts on Supernatural are, for me, just better than anything out there. The music is great (and will likely get better as the subscriber base grows). The VR locations are some of the most amazing places I’ve never seen and—to my surprise—add to the experience (it seemed gimmicky at first blush). Choreography is great overall. And the intensity of the workouts cannot be beat (I have an above avg. VO2 max and routinely hit HR of over 178 on the most intense boxing workouts). Just so much to like here and I find it worth the money. Because of Supernatural, the Oculus is the best piece of fitness equipment I own."
393,ArgonBosch,Aug 25 at 7:55 AM,2,Fancier but not better.,"I tried this to compare to Fit XR, which I very much enjoy. This looks like it will be better but it's not. Sure, you've got more locations, trainers, and bells and whistles but I felt detached. The boxing training, at first felt more in depth but that wore off quickly. After a short period I just didn't want to do it. And if you don't want to do it,  you won't. There lies the issue. Plus it is REALLY expensive!"
394,Sarah,Aug 25 at 9:25 PM,5,Love it!,"I have been using Supernatural for almost a month. I have been really enjoying the workouts, the songs are great and I love the scenery! It’s a great product."
395,Madkatt,Jul 6 at 7:26 AM,5,Love it,I love this app. It really does make working out fun and something I actually want to do. I see a lot of complaints about the cost of the subscription but I think it is totally worth it. It costs a little less than a monthly gym membership plus I don't  have to leave my house or see anyone.
396,Josh,Jul 13 at 11:29 PM,5,Love it!,Love this app. Great way to work out in the comfort of your own home. I Sweat so much using these workouts plus they have a great selection of music and great coaches. I don’t understand why people give it a bad rating because of the price. You cant beat $18.99+tx and having four profiles. My family loves it and so do I.
397,Bryan,Aug 18 at 4:52 AM,4,Crashes too often,"I love supernatural and it gets me moving. It’s fun and responsive and the hit detection is pretty good when it’s firing on all cylinders.

This will never however, receive 5 starts until I can mute the coaches, especially Ranier. His voice is rather obnoxious and For the the love of god stop screaming and attempting to sing, it’s way off tempo it ruins my “flow” and my attention to the song/workout.

Additionally, every bug I’ve encountered that I’ve reported I’ve been met back with the same standard trouble shooting suggestion to reboot my router. As an IT professional, I can assure you my network is not the problem for things like, workout loading with no music. Entire song workout doesn’t match music, rumble getting stuck in a controller non stop.

Stuff is getting added a lot though so I appreciate that, but axe Ranier or let me mute coaches. Fix the bugs and stop blaming my equipment for the issues."
398,Hank Scorpio,Sep 21 at 5:59 AM,3,Meh,"Was fun for a while but most of the music sucks and every time I look at new additions, I am disgusted by how the music is ever worse."

Workout together’. Right now our best fix it to join a pretty and then 1,2,3 on the same workout, but it would be infinitely more fun with a feiend you can see and interact with 💖"
402,Captain Awesome,Sep 8 at 9:09 PM,3,,"Not bad, but not good either. Every workout is just balls to hit, and bad music. Definitely not worth paying for every month. And once you are paying, good luck finding the cancel button..."
403,Onicus Rex,Jul 9 at 5:33 AM,3,"Great Idea, Bad Business Model","Just too expensive to justify. App isn't comparable to ""a gym membership"", because I get no access to equipment or benefits like I would a gym. It's lowkey just a glorified Beat Saber with annoying, hyper-pepped trainers and popular licensed music (unecessary and espensive and the main reason they charge so much). I could see $9.99-$14.99/mo but $20 is just too much to ask."
404,Bigdaddyrayray,Sep 7 at 1:49 AM,2,Fun while it lasted,The only thing useful was the boxing. However not enough heavy workouts with great music. Ended playing the same song lists over and over and it’s just boring at this point. Not worth the $$.
405,Ian Scott,Sep 21 at 3:52 AM,1,Can't try without forking over payment,"Just wanted to see what it's like, but I'm not allowed to do anything without signing up. Unless you know someone who's already spent money on it, and they let you play it, there's no way to try it first."
406,Hammer,Jun 18 at 3:24 AM,1,Done,"Shifted their focus from being the best fitness app on Quest to non-stop cringy virtue signaling. I was paying for daily new workouts with what I hoped would largely include constant additions of well-known good songs. Instead, you get bombarded with diversity pep talks and ethnicity/sexual preference of the month, which usually includes a lot of music that kind of sucks just because it’s from the featured group. They finally added Bohemian Rhapsody to a pride themed workout, but at least two of the songs in that same set were boring garbage that you have to struggle through.

I get it. We should accept everyone and I do. Coach Ranier is one of the top two coaches in my opinion - but I just want to get in the headset and exercise to music I like without the social messaging. The rabid Facebook community seems to love this other stuff, and gets all excited for drunks and drag queens as guest coaches (and goes nuts on anyone who dares to disagree and have the “wrong” opinion or even hints at wanting music they disapprove of). I’m not their target user and that’s fine. I will enjoy one of the other fitness apps instead. Subscription canceled."
407,Chrislach,Sep 18 at 12:59 AM,1,Need to cancel,Have had this since February not used it once broke my left controller and have not replaced it so need to cancel my subscription and can’t find out how to cancel
408,John,"Feb 28, 2022 at 8:48 PM",5,Life Changing - and data to prove it!,"I wanted to use my Oculus to move more. Like many I tried beat saber. It was fun but he lack of ability to calibrate the squat made it difficult for me. My wife tended to fail out and had to restart often. Both of us ended up flicking our wrists a lot and didn’t move our arms very much. The small number of available songs and the small selection of add on songs was also disappointing. 


On Jan 27th 2022 My wife and I began doing workouts on our VR headsets using a program called Supernatural. You can calibrate it for your physical capabilities- it learns how far you can squat, lunge left, lunge right. Rather than a game designed to be hard that will fail you out it is designed to maximize your movements and target specific muscles. The location scenery is amazing. You rotate 360 degrees as you play. You have a routine including a warm up and cool down with encouraging coaches cheering you on and teaching you proper form. There are over 1000 songs with something for everyone. New routines are added daily! In addition to the flow workout there is boxing. We didn’t think we’d enjoy boxing but we love it! You aren’t punching a person you are exploding targets with your fists. The movements and muscles feel very different than the flow workouts. We’ve also tried some of the stretching and guided meditation routines and they are also great! It’s like 4 programs in one!!

 Best of all it’s FUN! Beautiful Scenery, great music! You are doing this in the comfort of your home so no driving to a gym, no strangers watching you. You’ve can do a quick 7 minute workout in under 10 minutes including powering up the oculus and putting it away. I intend to do 20 minutes and rarely have a day I don’t do 30 of more because it’s so enjoyable!

You have a weekly scoreboard. You can see people you follow. Find some people with similar goals and follow them. You don’t have to be friends on oculus. The online Facebook community makes it easy. 

If you have an Apple Watch or a comparable heart rate monitor if will track your heart rate while you workout and add the workout to your health app. 

In the past 32 days I’ve exercised in supernatural for 28 of them. I was I sick 4 days. This is the most I’ve ever exercised. It’s enjoyable. I look forward to it. I have been exceeding my daily and weekly goal because I enjoy it so very much! 

I’m on a journey. I used to weigh 535.2lbs. Now I’m around 350bs. I’m currently 54 years young!

I’m a nerd and I love numbers. I wear my Apple Watch daily. Here are some numbers it gave before and after starting supernatural. I began Supernatural Jan27th 2022. This was written Feb 27th 2022

Average daily calories burned by activity:
2020 : 555
2021 : 506
Past month : 1291

Avg daily steps 
2019 : 2244 (when I went to work in the office)
2020 : 1124
2021: 1654 (had more Energy due to weight loss)
Past month : 3807

Avg daily minutes of exercise
2020 : 7
2021 : 7
2022 ( year so far): 35
Past 30 days : 51

Resting Heart Rate
2020 : 69BPM
2021 : 68BPM
Past month : 64BPM

Average walking heart rate 
2020: 122 BPM
2021: 122 BPM
Past month : 107

Standing more than 10 minutes at a time was torture. When I began exercising 5 weeks ago 20 minutes of standing was my limit. I was gasping for air a lot of the time. My heart rate was over 175bpm. Now I can do 40 minutes more intense exercise at a time. Heart rate doesn’t exceed 168bpm. Not gasping for air. 


We’re all in this together. 
I’m pulling for you!"
409,EnjoyJoshua,Aug 2 at 1:28 AM,4,Duration clock,Would really love to see a clock somewhere on the screen counting down duration of current track and maybe countdown for entire workout to be seen on the screen between tracks. Having an idea of how much longer I need to push for motivation to make it through would help me a lot.
410,Plee14,Sep 6 at 4:54 AM,5,Fun!,I HATE working out until I got this game! Now I want to do it every day!!
411,Andy,Aug 31 at 7:42 AM,5,Excellent workout,There’s a lot of new workouts all the time and the program is well worth the subscription cost!
412,DJ,Sep 29 at 8:41 PM,1,Impossible to cancel,Why is it so hard to cancel my subscription!??
413,Lexie,Sep 21 at 2:57 AM,1,Purchase,Won’t let me sign up for subscription and I know there’s plenty of money in my account. Pissing me off too.
414,Ray Snow,Jul 10 at 10:37 PM,1,Rip off in so many ways,"This app is a rip off in so many ways. Trying to get you hooked in a subscription  for an app that so many other apps do much better for  a 1 time purchase. I really liked this app until I realized  how overpriced and overhyped it is. The flow is a rip off of beat saber and  a more enjoyable  shadow boxing/dance experience  try audio trip. I attempted to cancel of course 1 day too late after my trial.  The coaching is just, sorry to say, annoying. I really wished i was notified  that my paid subscription  was about to start, but of course this app is not trying to earn my business, just get into my wallet.  I  need to remind myself  to stay away from subscription  based rip offs."
415,Mia,Aug 28 at 7:39 PM,5,I love it,"I give it a five, but I do wish we could customize our workouts based on the music and the intensity."
416,Michael,Aug 9 at 5:46 AM,1,Wont install,"Ive spent hours trying to install this game. They have my credit card , says I bought the game. But when I get to last prompt for 1 week trial, it doesn’t let me agree. So frustrating, tried reinstalling deleting, rebooting, factory setting for Occulus quest 2 everything. Still cant install or get a live person to talk to. So frustrating. All the other games work fine. I did everything they’ve  emailed me to do. still didn’t work. WTF? Spent days trying to get this to work."
417,DeadAF,Jun 6 at 3:31 AM,3,Could be 5 stars,"Suggestions: 

1)Add ability to make your own playlist with Supernatural VR music
2) Add ability to mute trainers
3) Add ability to utilize your own music
4) Add ability to see your own history of scores per song
5) Remove internet required, sometimes while traveling I don't always have internet. Make it like Netflix video downloads. Maybe you can select certain workouts for offline or have only need to connect once every few days to be active. 
6) Add ability to make your own workout session i.e. combine two workouts or create a work out. 

Will keep eye on future updates to see if any of these are incorporated and will resubscribe then.  For now switching to LiteBoxer so I can make my own playlists."
418,Funn Bobby,Jul 19 at 7:45 PM,5,Reach your goals!!,"This app is incredible...and the amount of upgrades,  enhancements, and work they are putting into this app makes me excited for its future.  For those saying that the pricing is too expensive, please go and price equipment and subscriptions for Peloton, NordicTrack etc..Supernatural is a fraction of the cost with world class coaching and incredible results if you're committed to it.  This is the future of home fitness!!"
419,Exhausting Process,Aug 11 at 5:49 AM,2,I would like it to consistently work,"I’ve had SN since June/2022 (now Aug2022) I’ve only managed 40 workouts due to difficulty connecting/staying connected to the App.

I love the workouts, but the App isn’t reliable.  It’s frustrating at best although I believe SN to be Outstanding as a fitness program- the connectivity is dismal"
420,Myles,Jan 8 at 5:19 AM,2,Expensive!!,High monthly fees but the scenery is amazing
421,Mimi,Jul 19 at 5:29 AM,5,Excellent !!,"I’ve been using this for 2 weeks. I am floored with the choices of music and levels of workouts. I’m surprised there are so many people complaining about having to buy a subscription. It is absolutely worth the price IMO. New content every week. Super fast support and an online community of support. It keeps me accountable and motivates me and connects to my Apple Watch.  I’m in for the long haul!

One thing I would like to see added is the ability to build your own playlist/workout by song."
422,stevie,Aug 10 at 6:34 AM,2,When it works it's great,"I used to love this app. I hate cardio but the boxing was super fun and I actually enjoyed the workouts.  For some reason the game started crapping out with connectivity issues between songs in a workout. I'd have to restart the app and restart my session, and each time I got one song deep and then it would say there was a connectivity problem. There was no connectivity problem. The final straw came after I installed the latest update and now the app refuses to load, presenting me with an error screen that says I needed to be connected to the internet. I *was* connected! Every other app, like YouTube, worked fine, but this one could not see the network I guess. Rebooted the oculus, no change. Too many glitches, too many interrupted workouts. I uninstalled and cancelled."
423,FisherGleek,Aug 23 at 6:49 PM,3,Meh,"The app is cool, but good luck trying to figure out how to cancel your subscription! Supernatural has been withdrawing $20 a month from my account and I haven’t even turned the Occulus on in at least that long. Buyer beware!"
424,Courtney Carter,"May 10, 2022 at 2:00 AM",5,Wish I could give it 10 stars!,"Life changing… before I started this, there was nothing that motivated me to work out.  Now… 6 months later not only do I look forward to it… I’ve lost 3 sizes and look better than I have in years.  It’s fun, has fantastic music and the coaches are phenomenal!   I could not recommend this more!"
425,Ben,Jul 25 at 5:32 PM,2,Easier to subscribe than to cancel.,"The coaches are the best part, but everything else was pretty boring for vr. To the point where I preferred just taking off the vr headset and doing body weight excercises instead. Not worth the subscription price in my opinion and like a lot of these subscriptions, it's easier to subscribe than it is to cancel the subscription. Which I hate with a passion. Also, there were multiple issues with connecting the phone app to headset and issues with the friends scoreboard feature, as well as account issues. 
I ended up moving to Les Mills instead, which I find has better boxing workouts, and the upside of no subscription as of now."
426,Handslingingslasher,Jul 23 at 8:43 PM,5,OMG,"I love the boxing workouts, I sweat like I've never sweated before with any workout. I love coach Leanne, she gives encouragement throughput the workout! 100% if you don't have this app, get it!"
427,Izzy,Aug 1 at 9:09 AM,5,Seriously Motivating,It's amazing to work out to the music that I love. It's to the point that I don't even feel like I'm working out because I'm enjoying myself so much and I'm just so emerged in the music. It's an amazing way to work out. Love it!
428,Nini-c,Aug 6 at 9:45 PM,4,Love this app,"I’ve been doing Supernatural for about a month now and I must say I really enjoy the boxing not a fan of the flow I have beat saber for that. 

You really can work up a sweat I love the fact that you can skip the cool down and immediately move into another training session. Really surprised how fast the time will fly when you are able to select the perfect level with the right motivating coach and music. My favorite coach is Doc.  

The only recommendation I would make is to add some of the latest Latin reggae hip-hop R&B and jazz tunes to the boxing sessions. Yes this would allow those of us who prefer boxing over f for flow to have just as many options. As right now it appears that area is Lackey which of course will cause us to look at other options."
429,Ahoz,Dec 18 at 3:53 PM,1,garbage not working,they accept your payment when you launch it and after the payment they say its not available in your country.. criminal app
430,X velez,Sep 5 at 8:46 AM,1,I hate this game,"I hate how it’s too much money and please tell me how to delete this game please service deserves a zero star
But I can’t put the zeros so it’s zero star still"
431,Brandy,Aug 6 at 10:49 PM,2,App keeps blacking out,"I’m new to this. I’ve been trying to explore and get into this…. But it keeps blacking out half way through workouts. I also have beat saber and it doesn’t do that with beat saber … only this app. I’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it didn’t solve it. Please help as the portion of workout info actually get to complete, I actually love…."
432,MD,Sep 3 at 9:29 AM,1,Now Not available on your county!,"So I'm traveling abroad and now I'm not able to use it because simply the developers are allowing certain countries to use it.
This is pissing me off and I'm moving to another app because of this"
433,Sylvia,Jul 15 at 4:49 AM,5,Awesomeness!!!,I had surgery on both my knees and can't do high impact or even low impact exercises. so with supernatural I get a wonderful cardio workout!!!  I love it much more than beat saber that was a waste of money!!!  This app is worth every single cent!!!! I use the it at the gym after yoga and everyone is always asking me what I'm doing. I share the information with as many people as I can.
434,Pigslife,Jul 22 at 3:53 AM,3,To expensive for a monthly prescription,"Given the more than double cost difference between Supernatural and other workout apps it just isn’t worth it. I was able to subscribe to VRFit and connect my bike for virtual rides for less than 3 months subscription on Supernatural. Sadly, they have priced themselves out of the market-good game and good exercises but not worth the money. They need to get at or below the $10/month like everyone else."
435,Nathan Guergis,Aug 10 at 9:16 AM,3,"Cool workouts, but way too expensive.","I did a few workouts with supernatural and really enjoyed it. It definitely feels like a nice workout. It would be awesome if the boxing lessons allowed hand tracking without the controllers like some games Are able to. The meditation could be better as well. It felt very gimmicky. My biggest gripe is the price. The roughly $20 per month just seems too expensive.￼ For double that, you could get access to peloton’s subscription service which is far more advanced.￼￼ This needs way more features to justify such a price in my opinion. It’s not comparable to actual boxing lessons and it’s mostly just a warm-up tool while you’re in your underwear at home. It would be nice if there was a beast free version, a slightly elevated version for five dollars a month, then a full on experience for $20 per month.￼
￼"
436,Rose Marie Ezell,Aug 5 at 2:28 PM,3,Love it but numerous bugs,"So addicted to this workout but there are numerous bugs and I swear they get worse after an update.  Bugs include; not connecting to the server, pausing within a song, and shutting down completely before cool down.  Please please please fix these issues.  I pay the money and I except it to work correctly."
437,MzPhillyBluntz,Aug 22 at 9:42 PM,5,I love this app,I love this app !!!!!! I’ve recommended this app to my family and friends and they love it too!!!
438,Forbiddenknowledge,Jul 23 at 8:16 AM,4,Idea,"This app is wonderful and keeps getting better, it would be great to be able to form your own work out list. To be able to take a song or two from different workouts, to make your own personal workout would be great. 
                  Thank You,
                         Ms. Harris"
439,Kathy Gardner,"May 24, 2022 at 12:26 AM",5,Helps my PT and Rehabilitation,"(May 2022).  I recently injured my left knee and fractured my L1 vertebra in a bad fall.  With the approval of my doctor, I’ve been using Supernatural Flow programs daily to add to my PT rehabilitation.  

I do the workouts sitting in an office chair that spins.  The daily workouts really boost my mood and help me build stamina and add a cardiovascular component.  The chair allows me to spin 360 degrees using my legs and access all targets.

It’s very uplifting and gratifying.  I can’t wait until I can start standing and can move fully. (Of course, with caution.). My doctors always enjoy hearing about my progress.

Thank you Supernatural coaches, choreographers and programmers!  Love it!"
440,Ksims47,Aug 3 at 2:47 AM,4,Love It! Just Wish…,"Update: still love it, but want to be able to make my own playlist. Targets are already set for each song, so I’d love to make my own workout list. Even if it means a different coach for each song. Now…I love the coaches and their encouragement through out the workout. I’m 57, so the music is my only tiny issue. I would love to have more choices and I would love to be able to skip a song if I hate it. There will be a whole track I love except one song I can’t stand and won’t listen to. Other than that it’s worth the price, it’s worth my time, and it’s making me love to exercise! Please let us skip songs and maybe let us tie two workouts one after the other instead of having to stop and pick another one :)"
441,Cheryl,Jul 19 at 10:19 AM,3,Good app; could be better,"I've been using this app daily for a couple of weeks now because I'm still in my free trial. I'm still not sure if I'm going to renew. I might try it for a month and see if it holds my attention.

The good things about it are that you really do get a good workout, there's a lot of squats and moving around that you don't do as much with something like beat saber. Having actual coaches talking to you throughout the workout and having a much better variety of music makes it very appealing. The scenery is also beautiful.

What I don't like about it is the jerky motions that it sometimes makes you do throughout a workout. When the balloons are coming at you in a way that you have to halt in the middle of an arm motion and change direction and really concentrate on the different colors, it can be very distracting and doesn't feel great, especially when they tell you that you're supposed to be making big motions with your arms whenever possible, and you find yourself having to just make little flicks with your wrist in order to hit the correct colors. And there's no way not to do that. Does that makes sense? Also you could be in the middle of a good back and forth with lunges, but then they lose the beat and you have to do something completely different for one or two steps and then maybe go back into one lunge and then maybe do something else completely different. It just doesn't feel like it flows very well. I'm probably not describing as well but it's like a mishmash of spastic dance moves that don't work well together, and you feel like you're making a clunky mess of it, even if normally you're a pretty good dancer.

The other thing of course is the cost. $20 a month is kind of ridiculous for what this is. I would think $5-8 a month might be more reasonable. Especially since there are a lot of other workouts on the VR that don't cost you anything extra after the initial app price.

After reading some of your replies to people, I will say that I've been using this for a couple of weeks and had no idea that you did a new workout everyday. I don't even know how I would have found that out because it's not something that was highlighted on my welcome screen ever. So maybe that's not that important. Maybe you don't need to add a new workout everyday. And maybe that would keep the cost down. You already have so many workouts on here that I can't imagine you need to cater to people who need that much variety."
442,Aeon,Jul 18 at 10:32 AM,3,Expensive .. But not too Expensive,"It’s not a review somewhat feedback. Instead of charging $20, Divide into two plans like basic and premium. If basic plan is less then $10 with limited content, I think more people will join and who want to spend that $20 premium pack with extra content will take it. This way everyone will be happy."
443,Sophia,Jul 20 at 6:17 AM,3,Staying connected,Supernatural will not stay connected to my Wi-Fi. I’m connected through the app and through the headset. All my other apps stay connected so I know it’s not my Wi-Fi or headset. It costs too much money to not work properly. It’s an awesome workout tool. Just can’t finish a workout.
444,Shellie,Sep 8 at 2:44 PM,2,Supernatural,"I want this cancelked, I have tried for 3 days to cancel it and it won't cancel.  PLEASE CANCEL THIS SUBSCRIPTION!!"
445,Glenda,Aug 10 at 2:06 AM,4,Love this app,I really enjoy the workouts and meditations in this app. I will probably pay the subscription every other month though because I like to switch up my workouts and try other fitness apps as well. I have lost 4 lbs in my first month of using Supernatural.
446,Choong Lee,Jul 15 at 4:27 PM,1,Free trial fraud,"I cannot find the cancel button or link. They sent me instruction but in the mebership page, it simply says that ill be charged $179. Thats it. No further info, explanation, or cancel link.
I sent an email to their support and wait for response. But at least it is too difficult to cancel or even impossible ."
447,Wendy,Aug 5 at 7:24 AM,5,Great way to wake up!,This is the only “workout” that motivates me! So fun!Seriously the BEST workout that doesn’t feel like a workout. It still makes me smile over a year later ❤️
448,mayra,Dec 27 at 10:38 PM,1,way too expensive,"So,expensive  is not affordable 😒"
449,ShawneeT,Jul 31 at 12:37 AM,2,Not a fan,"After using Les Mills Body Combat for a month and losing 12lbs, I thought I would give Supernatural  a shot to mix things up. I find it very chaotic. With Les Mills, you really have no option but to hold yourself accountable for the amount of force you use as well as the consistency for each punch. I feel like I can stand there with my arms out in Supernatural and I would still hit the targets. And it's so fast for a beginner. Even on the low intensity, it's way to fast and crazy with everything flying at you from all over the place. Hated it. Cancelled the membership."
450,PewPewPew,Jul 13 at 4:43 AM,1,The real exercise is trying to log in,"I signed up for the free trial. Absolutely loved it. Decided to keep the membership. Life happens so went a couple months without using it. I get some free time this evening and say, “You know what, I am going to get back into Supernaturnal!” 

Boy was I wrong. I opened the app (which took a really long time to load) and finally clicked “get started”. After a brief loading ping pong screen - nothing happens. I then go to sign in, and it asks if I have the companion app. I download it then click “Yes”. It tells me to enter the PIN code in my headset. The pin code boxes on the headset are blank. Okay. Let’s exit the game, reload the app, and try again. Still no luck. I then try to log in through my Facebook account. Still won’t work. I reset my password on getsupernatural.com. Still can’t log on through the headset.

At this point, the mood to want to work out was completely gone and I’m disgusted at not being able to log into an account I’m actively paying for a membership for. Well I was. I cancelled it tonight. I want to work out, not navigate the dodgey account login issues."
451,Cleo,Jul 28 at 8:28 AM,1,Almost perfect,"I trail-compared almost all of these VR boxing games and think this is absolutely No.1. 
I even wrote a long review in a Chinese community app and got tons reviews. And I really don’t mind the $ paid every month.
I only want to talking about 2 reasons that I cannot subscribe this app and hope the company could see but rating 1 star this way.
1. Multi-player mood, PLEASE. This is really A really important motivation/trigger for customers like me and my gal friends, so we could encourage each other turn on the app and start training. Otherwise, I’m afraid after I subscribed I never turn it on…
And beside, during the training we could feel that our friend by outside and encouraging that’s a key.
2. If the 1 come true. Please set an option that we could turn off the couch sound..
I really appreciate the app compliments and am looking forward to subscribe your app."
452,Momma,Aug 11 at 10:40 PM,1,Ripe off. Beware,"They will tell you that you have a free trail. And then after you end the trail they start charging you. Even after I declined it after the trail. 9 months later no returned calls or emails, no communication from them at all"
453,Me,Aug 22 at 12:57 AM,1,Free??,F@ck you….$179 to use the app. I hate dishonesty. I’ll never use an app by this company again.
454,Amaze,Sep 21 at 10:01 PM,1,Not worth the money,This games sucks and is not worth it
455,Evers,Jul 1 at 7:28 AM,1,Something is going on,"I’m trying to cancel the free subscription prior to the start of the actual subscription. As I enter the page and select the cancel subscription button. It says there’s an error with my query?! Then it makes the button disappear and won’t let me cancel! If I have to cancel my card to stop their charge, I’ll be upset."
456,Vexed Nomad,"Apr 4, 2022 at 5:52 AM",4,"Solid workouts, bad subscription","EDIT: Alright, fine, I started the subscription again. I tried several other work out apps, including Beat Saber, and just didn't like any of them as much as Supernatural. I really enjoy the layouts of the flow routines, the boxing, the stretching, and most of the personal trainers. Here are my suggestions though:
-Make turning off trainer commentary an option. I like the enthusiasm and support, but sometimes I just want some me time. Plus, the commentary gets repetitive on my favorite workouts.
-Let me create custom workouts. This would really add variety and make me feel like I'm getting the most out of my money.
-Let me customize the look of the flow batons. Because I pretend they're swords anyways, they may as well look like swords.

I bought a Quest mainly to work out and Supernatural is great for that. Boxing, Beat Saber-like training, stretching, coaching, all good. But paying $20 a month just isn't going to work. I get why, mostly, since new workouts are added daily, but it's not enough for how much monthly payments will add up to, on top of the fact that im already a little bored with the music selections. Maybe I'll be back in the future, but for now I'll be trying other options."
457,music lover,Aug 24 at 12:24 AM,2,Frustrated,"I am trying to cancel my subscription, but can't figure it out. And there's no option to contact for help. For this reason, I'm giving a low review. I'm very frustrated :("

459,Labdude,Jul 19 at 8:24 PM,1,Ackward and Expesive,"If you're into casual fitness this might work for you.  Doing anything too vigorous with the headset on, can be ackward and cause neck strain.  My biggest pet peeve is the ""Cancel anytime before your free trail is done"".  There is no way within the website or app to do that.  They point you to the same place, but there is no option to cancel.  Had to remove my payment method from Meta and notify the payment method I had withdrawn authorization."
460,Hey you,Jul 27 at 5:11 PM,4,,"I know most people are upset about the cost but if you compare those to a gym membership, you pay about the same price monthly. Added bonus. You are not locked into a contract.
I like this, beautiful scenery, good music, and I don't have to leave my house. No gym showers or locking your stuff up. I don't have to fit in time to leave and come back."
461,Talzahr,Aug 29 at 5:50 AM,1,Too expensive. Costs as much as a gym,"Says free trial but have to shell out money at the start. ""Risk free""  is not free trial. Stop making expensive monthly sub VR apps. You're the piriah of the VR space and why it'll never catch on. Go out of business please."

Out of desperation my wife signed up for a 7 day trial linked to a monthly subscription which would auto renew. Wife loves it, so we decided to keep the subscription and I migrated my account to hers to share the subscription. 

Monthly subscription is active now, imagine my surprise when out of nowhere today the developer tried to bill my account for the annual subscription , luckily my bank had the good sense to block them. Then 6 hours later they tried again. There is no way for me to cancel the 14 day trial because it never succeeded to be set up on my quest to begin with"
466,Cyndi,Aug 9 at 3:18 AM,5,Love it!,Some customizable would be great and more pro workouts. After 6 months most of the workouts are way to easy for me.

It motivates me to keep pushing myself and and I’m starting to see the results. I know it maybe a little pricey but I hate going to a gym so supernatural is perfect! The few times I’ve had problems with the app support helped me and they were great. Patient, helpful and knowledgeable. There’s so many workouts to choose from and they add more all the time…I’m never going to a gym again"
468,rainrshineimfine,Jul 3 at 8:40 AM,5,Would be my favorite app,But as it is right now it is not my favorite. Most of the time in the app I am waiting on it to load this is the only app I have a problem in. I haven't finished a work out yet. And its not from not showing up. I look forward to the work out. But all I got is errors and try again. I even subscribe because I love the coaches so I am going to try and get my money back but to all of you that get it to download I am jealous🤬. I wish it would work for me. Everyone enjoy if you can I know I would if I could.

I tried to cancel and refund but it said it would cancel the auto renew but not refund the $190 because I'm assuming my son had played it for more than 5 minutes. I didn't even receive a notification that the trial was up so I could cancel before being charged!! This is ridiculous!!!
471,Jeff,Nov 28 at 8:18 AM,1,Expensive subscription model - yuck,"Give me an app I can purchase once, and maybe some purchasable downloadable content. But I'm not going for a monthly (or other timeframe) subscription."
472,Sunshine Mary,Jul 2 at 1:41 AM,5,Subscription is worth it!!,"Never thought I’d say it but: Thank God for the subscription based service! 
They put out new workouts every day, and have live coaches who are in the Facebook group. Supernatural has beautiful environments, workouts, stretches, and meditations. Best of all: the coaches keep you motivated, remind you to breath, remind you of your form, and remind you of your POWER and how much you should/can/do love yourself. Because of the coaches, each time I workout it feels like I’m ingraining that I’m showing myself love just by showing up and that it truly is “Self Care”. They just added 2 workouts with Katy Perry music, a way to search for musical artists in-game, and a special Pride workout by legendary Queen: Shea Couleé!! Wonderful!! This company feels open, honest, loving, encouraging, and beautifully accepting. I have a Rift S, but after trying Supernatural, I literally bought a Quest 2 just for it!!! I see it as an investment in myself. I know not everyone can do that… I’m in a good situation right now. So yeah: if you can try it, definitely do so! Great company, great workouts and meditations, just: perfect."
473,BlueDogs,Jul 2 at 7:08 AM,5,In love with this app,"Every other app has went dark. I'm down 20lbs with 30 more to go. It's a bit pricey but in my opinion worth it. I'm sure it's not cheap purchasing rights for music, paying programmers and fitness coaches. This app makes moving fun! The constant encouragement is what keeps me coming back for more. Love love love this app!"
474,Qteafurever,Jul 1 at 6:48 PM,5,Wow,To start off saying this is my 1st review on oculus quest and I have had the headset since February of this year. Honestly I wanted to hate the game so I didn't have to pay monthly for a subscription.  But my 1st 20 min workout kicked my butt today but I enjoyed every min of it. I sweat so much and burned more calories in this game then any other workout apps I've tried. Big plus for me it wasn't boring working out. If its boring I don't get motivated and being motivated gets me off my butt lol so anyway yes there's a subscription but I think it'll be worth it. Get it you won't be disappointed!
475,DARTHitect,Jul 25 at 8:10 AM,1,No warning to cancel subscription,Not cool how I was charged the $179.  I thought I was only enrolled in try out.  Then surprise!  It’s in my credit card. There ought to be a follow up about the one year subscription or a way to cancel at a pro rated rate.  Reminds me of trying to cancel with cable company or aol.
476,Jack's Phone,Aug 6 at 11:05 PM,5,Worth the subscription,"It's Boxing, beat saber, and a meditation app all in one with support for the whole family on a single subscription."
477,AEKonietzky,Jul 30 at 3:28 AM,1,Absolutely ridiculous pricing...,"So many other Exercise options from single priced games like SynthRiders, Beat Saber, PistolWhip, Audica, AudioTrip, even Dance Central to name a few. LoL. There are even other Exercise App options that offer single fees OR Lifetime Membership options. Honestly, you get a better deal with a REAL LIFE Gym in your area than the cost of this app. It's nuts when there are so many better financial options for the same thing or even BETTER."
478,Tiffany,Jun 15 at 4:25 AM,5,Great game and more affordable than most,This is a great game/work out and very affordable.  I would rather do this out of the comfort of my home or anywhere I'm at than go to the gym.  Most gyms are anywhere from 10 up to 50$ a month.  15 a month on this is nothing.  Best part is I can take it anywhere.  I'm a travel nurse and like to stay in shape.  This give me the option to bring the gym with me vs signing up over and over again at different locations. With Being an introvert I can always work out in private.  Would be nice to have more Spanish songs on here though.  The regulation world is growing and that type of music is fire! Oh and maybe some hip hop from the early 2000s would be nice once in a while 😅
479,Madeline Ortiz,Jun 29 at 9:24 PM,5,Worth the cost!,"This app has changed working out for me! I don’t mind working out but never have been able to find something I like, something I’m excited about, and that makes me feel good. They upload everyday. They have such fun trainers and plenty of fun songs. AND it’s not just one type of workout, you have flow, boxing, meditation ( which has helped my anxiety and blood pressure), and stretch. Yes, it’s pricey. But when you find something that work for you, it’s well worth it! Plus, for the same price, you um an have multiple profiles on it which makes it even more worth while. Thanks supernatural for making working out a whole new experience. OH! did I mention I travel the world while doing it!? That just might be the best part."
480,Bobbie Sissom,Jun 30 at 4:21 PM,5,"Cheaper than a gym, way more fun…","Yeah, I do wish there was a monthly option. paying $180 for this app in one pop feels like a lot (cause it is) but that’s $15/mo which is less than most gym memberships. I HATE working out for working outs sake. I hate walking/running in place on a treadmill and I hate going to the gym. But this I actually look forward to! That is priceless for me. I stalled out trying to lose weight and have been so frustrated but knew it was because I needed more exercise, problem is I hate exercising. But this is fun, and you’re so focused the whole time trying to keep the pace, trying to hit your targets, a 25 minute workout is over in a flash and when I’m done I’m completely drenched in sweat! Beat saber is way cheaper and a lot of fun, but this one is more challenging and I just started last week, but I’ve been sore the next day from all the squats and high energy movements. Beat Saber is fun and can make you sweat after a bit but it doesn’t make your muscles sore. While it hurts a little to throw down $180, it is going to pay for a whole year of really fun and effective workouts so for me it’s worth it!"
481,RawBlow,"Apr 18, 2022 at 10:25 PM",4,Great app / monthly subscription bad,"I’ve had this app on subscription for some months now. I like it but I don’t play $20 a month worth. So I opted out and canceled the subscription. I enjoy other games so much I was only playing supernatural 2-3 times a month. At this point I would only be willing to pay $5 a month to keep this, maybe $10 a month but not $20"
482,Marie,Jun 14 at 12:15 AM,5,Amazing addition,"I love Supernatural! Anyone who wants to complain about the price of the subscription, send them my way. It is worth every cent! Those of you who cry about the price, if you do a year subscription, you are essentially getting 2 months free. Stop drinking Starbucks and energy drinks for one month and you'll have enough for the subscription for the year. You're not committed if you want to complain about the price. Graphics are phenomenal. Workouts are intense and so fun. I love being able to pick what kind of music I want to workout to or just try another genre because I can. You guys have got the best coaches and the support online for everyone is great! Thanks for your program. I'm committed and all in"
483,cee_reyts,Jul 5 at 8:21 PM,3,Can't cancel subscription!!,"No doubt, this is an excellent app and it got me through many bad-weather days over the past two years.  But I am back to getting my fitness outside now... I have been trying for months to figure out how to cancel this subscription, and there's just no easy way to do it, so I've just been throwing money away in the meantime.  I loved Supernatural but honestly, if I had been warned about how difficult it would be to cancel, I wouldn't have gone for it.  I think the fault may be with the facebook account to meta platform merge, but my attempts to contact support have gone unanswered."
484,Dylan,Sep 9 at 3:43 AM,1,Contact information,Where can I find contact information
485,Tabby,Jun 28 at 9:42 AM,5,The best and it keeps getting better!!,I’ve been using supernatural since December and it has been the best investment I’ve ever made for myself. I actually look forward to exercising for the first time ever. I never stick to a workout program and I have done this consistently for the last 6 months. They have new workouts everyday and they are constantly updating and finding ways to make it better. The last update gave us a search feature and they just added a spotlight artist workout a month which is amazing. Yea it is a little pricy but it’s less than the gym membership I had and never used. At least this I know I will use 💪🏼. At 42 I’m in the best shape I’ve been in since my early 20s.
486,C-holio,Jun 24 at 6:22 PM,1,2nd chance still does not work,"I really wish the app would work because the few times it did work i really enjoyed it, but you better have a perfect internet connection otherwise your wasting your money like me. (twice). I live out in the country. I have to use a mobile wireless router so it's not the best but I can be watching YouTube and my wife streaming Hulu all day long no problem, my house runs on Alex. No problem.  I want to play supernatural..99.99% of the time there's a problem. I even renewed my subscription a 2nd time hoping it would work. 2nd time around it doesn't work at all except for the main menu loading then it says oops there's a problem. I have deleted and reloaded this app multiple times. Just wasted $40 (2 months subscription) just FYI if the app doesn't work in the 7 day trail, your internet probably will not be able to feed this apps voracious appetite. It's probably  for the best because it's a very pricey app. I'll just stick with Beat Saber, it's paid for"
487,Ezekiel,Aug 24 at 12:13 AM,1,It's just common sense.,"If they can subscribe through the HMD they can cancel it though the HMD. It's not a law -yet- but you better prepare for it, jerks."
488,CrashR,Jul 11 at 1:31 AM,1,I feel baited,At first Looks like it has potential. Then you get stuck into hey subscribe and pay more money all the time.. No THANKS would rather just go to a real gym! Scam! Wishing would of know was subscription based before even installing it. I’ll stick with beat saber!... update just got their response and Boom point PROVEN.. CLICK BAIT! You are notified only AFTER you start free trial! Nice scam you got going!!
489,Michael,Jun 27 at 3:17 AM,5,100% worth the $19 a month.,"The developers are so thoughtful. It's incredibly user friendly, and it has sessions not just for physical exercise but also for stretching and meditating as well. Everything about this is so well done and honestly deserves so much praise for the amount of effort and care that has been put into this.

One of my favorite aspects about this is that all of the trainers are so encouraging and inspirational. And not just throughout the workout but also before and after as well. There's no bugs, no glitches, the scenery is beautiful, the music is on point. I genuinely have nothing bad to say.

I read through the reviews before downloading and the only complaint that people had was of the $19 monthly subscription cost, which is crazy for people to be upset about. This is a premium service that is routinely updated and kept up with. You can immediately tell how professionally made this was as soon as you open the app and get started. It's worth every cent.

Get your priorities straight. $19 a month for better health. It's worth the investment. Anyone can find $19 a month. Stop wasting your money on things you don't need, like having one less take out meal a month or having multiple video subscription services, or just pick up an extra hour or two at work. 

It's important to support the people who help create and develop these kinds of apps so that they can keep supporting us."
490,N8Dizzle,Jun 13 at 2:08 AM,4,Great but room for improvement,"2 major missing features to take this to 5*:

1. An option to turn off the instructor audio track. Most of the time they hurt and direct more than help, but I get that for some people it gets them pumped up...not me. I don't need the side conversation about how the song reminds you of your senior prom or your memories of being on a roller rink. Just let me get my workout in.

2. Better fitness tracker integration. It's great to offer that but the list of compatible trackers are very few and missing big integrations like Fitbit or Samsung products so it feels like a half-baked feature."
491,TidyHydrangea,Jun 24 at 11:57 PM,5,Best workout app on Oculus,"I'm surprised at how much I LOVE this app! I'm 62 and not a work out kind of person, tbh. But I work up a sweat with this & enjoy it the whole time.  The scenery in 3D is like a vacation, the coaches are supportive and positive, and you can increase the difficulty as you improve & get stronger. FIVE STARS"
492,Sarahkatheryn,Jul 17 at 5:08 AM,3,Graphics issues,I would prob have purchased this beyond the free trial but when the things are flying at you and the closer they get they disappear. So I can really only guess where they are by the time I can hit them. I tried hitting them a lot earlier but they’re too far away at that point. So it just ends up feeling discouraging
493,Lisa,Jun 29 at 4:14 AM,5,Love Supernatural ❤️,"I just love this app. Enjoyable workouts is what some of us strive for. I don't find the cost to be burdensome at all. There are so many workouts out there that cost so much more. Love the music and I'm sure that most of the cost of this app, like Beat Saber, is music licensing."
494,Wagonpit,Jun 4 at 8:38 AM,1,Ripped me off for almost $200,"My 8 year old downloaded this because he thought it was free when it said free trial. I just got charged $195.00 for this yearly subscription and it will not get used.  So frustrating! That was my grocery budget. Why would it default to a yearly membership,  rather that monthly? Because they are trying to rip people off, that's why! I doubt my son even played it when he downloaded it.  So frustrating! Beware!"
495,DMC.1,Aug 14 at 2:46 AM,4,Great,"Great workout!  Beautiful scenery!  I just wish there was more variety!  How about  “West Side Story “ other great musicals please!
Thanks"
496,Jennifer Bailey,Jun 10 at 3:27 AM,5,Do it!! Absolutely worth it!,"I am NOT someone that likes to exercise and I’ve never once stuck to something like SN before.   I did the trial and let it sit dormant for awhile then finally I went ahead and purchased the year so I’d kind of force myself to jump in feet first and now I’m in Love with it and so is my body.  The SN community on FB is so encouraging to everyone as well. The coaches are real people and will interact with you online.  They all have a story to tell, keep you having fun and motivate you too!   Theres music for everyone and it’s great artists too.  This was designed to be healthy, fun, adventurous (you travel to tons of beautiful places), and it’s all inclusive - everyone is felt welcome no matter your fitness level, health, age, etc.   The meditation in here has also helped me clear my headspace many times when I needed it.   I’ve laughed in here, cried, screamed, cheered, sweated plenty too.    Losing weight and my body and heart feels stronger than it has been in a long time.  Thank you Supernatural!!"
497,Mario,Jul 13 at 1:30 AM,4,"Great workouts, worth the price.","I see a lot of people criticizing the app and the price. Well to be honest it is expensive but when has investing in your body been cheap? I mean the cost could be much higher for what you get here, which is new workouts and teachers regularly. I find the workouts addictive, fun and energizing, I don’t know what else you can ask for. It’s almost like people see this as a game, it’s not a game, it’s a workout program folks. Go play beat saber if you want a cheap game. I’m not a fan of the overt LGBTQ push when all I want to do is workout. If you cater to one group, cater to them all if you’re going to push agendas. Overall, it’s worth the 4 stars I gave it though."
498,Hannah H,Aug 16 at 8:04 PM,1,No Custom Playlist,"For the price, you should be able to make a custom playlist. I've only found 1 workout where I like all of the songs."
499,Barry Vickers,Aug 26 at 11:56 PM,1,Purgatory,"App tries to keep you locked in, latest update removed the quit button from their menu."
500,Leah,Aug 5 at 12:24 PM,2,Cancelled Membership,I cancelled my membership before the end of the trial period but they keep attempting to charge my credit card.
501,Linda,Jun 21 at 6:58 AM,5,I finally found a workout program for me,"I’ve never been the type who could stand being in a treadmill and stare at a wall for an hour. Traditional gyms bore me and the people there creep me out. Supernatural has been what I’ve always wanted. There is new workouts everyday, I’ve never done the same workout twice! Now that is insane. I remember the 90’s and 00’s where you would get a workout dvd and play it over and over and over. There is so much content, such a great community involved. It’s all official licensed music, not generic background songs. It’s well worth the price, it’s expensive but I’ve seen people take a yoga class for an hour for $50. In terms of what other fitness classes/ programs people do, supernatural is a bargain. They also have boxing now, I looked into a real boxing class near me $70 for a class!!I love the point system, weekly goals, the coaches are so motivating. Being a plus size person in supernatural is embraced by the culture and community. 15+ plus pounds down from having fun!! I couldn’t be more happy!!"
502,Shallabal,Aug 17 at 3:55 AM,5,Awesome,Awesome game
503,SarahLitty,Jul 11 at 5:08 AM,5,The best!!!,"Keeps me coming back! Great coaching, fresh workouts daily and fantastic community.  Love everything about it, always feels like home when I log in.  Gorgeous scenery with great music and mapping."
504,GiftedHealer,Aug 19 at 8:41 PM,3,Too expensive,Sad that I gotta let it go not worth this much when there’s other ones out there same & less$$✌🏼
505,Kate,Jun 28 at 9:13 PM,5,Exactly what I needed,I’m paying 250 a month for a family gym membership we all hate going to. My treadmill in my room bores the ever living daylight out of me. I have so much fun with Supernatural I don’t want to stop and that’s the formula I’ve been searching for.
506,MaryLynn,Jun 18 at 7:37 PM,5,Since Updating to Full Year Membership,"SUCCESS!  My internet provider updated their service, so I was able to increase my mbps!!!  Thank you support for your quick response. LOVE THIS APP!

Previous Post:  love this app.  However, I have not been able to down load or participate in any workouts since changing my membership from monthly charge to yearly.  Today I Uninstaller and will reinstall.  Hopefully that corrects the issue.  Otherwise  - how do I get a refund?  Thank you."
507,Hunter,Jul 25 at 10:43 AM,5,Back to working out,I really don't like working out but with supernatural am able to get back into it. Highly recommend you at least try it.
508,iGenVector,Jun 11 at 4:06 AM,2,Subscription is deal breaker,"Subscription like the only option is not good strategy. Application itself is great, but after some week or two I realised that current price by subscription is overpriced.

Update: 
Thanks for reply. But here is the simple math🧮. It is better to give customer some base pack with first purchase than just let him go to alternatives after the trial period and get zero from it. You can also sell training packs and give subscription for those who prefer unlimited. This is not my business of course just do whatever you think best on your vision, but those are just friendly recommendations to help nice tool and users find each other 😉"
509,Gian,Jul 31 at 12:23 AM,4,"It's good, great actually","But as literally everyone else is saying, the price is too expensive. $10/month would be more reasonable. (Or $12, and $10 if you pay annually) but $20? Crazy. The funny thing is, they would 1000% make more money."
510,Kraken132,Jul 12 at 11:10 AM,2,Just a few questions,"So … before I pay money to have this app. I have just two questions …. Is it true that y’all hire drag queens(or trans-gendered) as well as drunks, as coaches in your app.? Also, can you create a playlist of music that you like? Or is it whatever the app gives you, and forget what we like??"
511,Kristin Michelle,Jun 3 at 9:00 PM,3,pricing isnt feasible for some,you should really make this something more folks can use! theres a reason i dont go to a gym i cant afford it! i recently lost my job therefore i cant even use this app that ive already invested quite a bit of money into it. make it $10 a month or even where you can purchase a workout and download it so that if for some reason someone cant afford the $20 they can still workout with the workouts they purchased! And of course you didn’t even really respond! You inserted a prepared response that you e put on everyone else’s review. Makes me think you aren’t really listening to your audience or reviews! If you make it where you can purchase workouts to own then you are still making money while at the same time catering to way more people! So like me I lost my job for 2 months now had I been able to purchase a workout for idk say $2 to$5 then I would’ve still been able to keep my streak along with working out and along with you still making money.
512,Abe,Aug 27 at 4:43 AM,1,Good luck,Wait till you try to cancel it’s impossible
513,Katya,Jun 17 at 6:05 AM,5,Absolutely in love with Supernatural!,I love working out with Supernatural! It is fun workout that makes me want to be back every single day. Love the music and all the coaches. You can choose your level of intensity which is nice. Every time when I am done working out I am soaking wet. Love this app and will be keep my membership for many years.  Just wish it was not as expensive but the way I look at it it worth every single penny if it makes me want to work out and helps me with weight loss.
514,B.J. Cupps,Jun 28 at 5:41 AM,2,maybe worth it for some?,"Get through the demo–could be worth it for some.  At first it seemed like a typical 1-time buy like HitStream, except it costs $20 monthly instead.  As I understand it the seemingly unreasonably high price is actually due to music licensing and fitness trainers creating daily content.  Unfortunately despite these unique quality indicators the net outcome still didn't come close to making me feel like it'd be worth paying the fee once, let alone every month.  I still had to give it 2 stars instead of 1 though for being pretty...I hope they might one day throw out all the unnecessary expensive music and maybe opt for a way to reuse trainings–whatever it takes to widen their socioeconomic audience."
515,Jake the snake killian yt,Sep 18 at 5:36 PM,1,Sad,Basically a ripoff beatsaber
516,Infamous26,Jul 29 at 1:07 AM,5,Great app,I went on here and enjoyed it. Its a great app I also love the workouts they have set up
517,Penny,Jul 27 at 1:33 AM,1,Supernatural,I have downloaded this app it says I have purchased it but I cannot get it too low it just keeps saying oops something went wrong I have deleted the Oculus app and redownloaded it but still no luck
518,Manoj,Jul 21 at 5:27 AM,1,Unable to refund,"I am unable to cancel the subscription after free trial. 

It is not straight forward like other apps."
519,FussyComplainer,Jun 25 at 9:05 PM,2,Free trial,"I didn’t even get to use my free trial and it was over.  I thought the trail doesn’t begin until after you click into the game, well that wasn’t true. They were already trying to charge my card before I even got to try the game out."
520,Bigrich,Jun 19 at 9:28 PM,1,Highly upset,Don't get me wrong the game was great on exercise. But I tried to do the monthly subscription and they took $192 out of my account and I can't seem to find out how to get a refund they shouldn't have token that when I was willing to do do the monthly $20. Please return my money and I may restart the subscription
521,CaliforniaDreamin,Jun 17 at 7:23 PM,5,Life changing,I’ve been doing this for five weeks and I have lost 12 pounds. Yes I am eating better but I’m getting way more physical activity with Supernatural than I have in years.  Very much worth of money! It’s basically the price of going out to eat one time. I would highly recommend.
522,AntGonz,Jun 14 at 1:33 PM,5,Supernatural,"I love this app, I won't call it a game, worth it, I am tired and sweating bullets. I never feel sick from the movements like many other games. Good rhythm even in boxing it's entertaining and a heck of a workout, worth the subscription fee 100% and has a free trial so you KNOW it works for you before you buy it"
523,Justin Raddatz,Jun 3 at 5:54 PM,2,"Good workout, heavy political overtones","I really enjoyed the workouts - the platform is well made and engaging.  I am a very fit individual and still found the workouts to be challenging and fun.  I looked forward to these workouts a few mornings a week.

I was turned off, however, by the often overt political overtones in the workout programs and themes, such as front-and-center themes like gay pride workouts.  No matter the political lean, left or right, I don’t need political messages in my workouts - just a workout.

Also, I was disappointed to see the new coach who was added - a severely obese woman.  Although she and overweight people are absolutely deserving of exceptional fitness, I am not motivated by someone who does not have fruit on her tree for the subject matter she is teaching.  Imagine being presented with a financial advisor who has been bankrupt 4 times but is working really hard to establish some savings and move out of mom’s basement.

Again, the platform is exceptional and, short of the points noted below, I would be a subscriber."
524,Jojo,Jun 13 at 7:35 AM,5,Great Porgram/App,"I used the trial and loved it so decided to subscribe. With the price of the gym for our family, this isn’t bad at all. Not to mention I have to drive to the gym and put on “decent” clothes. I can do this at home wearing whatever I want and can do it whenever I want. It’s definitely worth every penny for my family."
525,Cesar Smith,Jun 19 at 9:28 PM,3,Still the same complaints...,"I tried this at the very beginning... I see it has all the same issues. No song choice, can't mute trainers, can't turn of lyrics. Sad because the workout are good. I would pay the subscription with the above options without the multi users per account. 

I did find out a better workout is possible in Beat Saber in 360 mode on expert + in school mode at 80% speed not to mention being able to side load the songs I want. All for the one time price of $20. 

Need more funk groove music maybe from Pomplamouse? Their remixes are fire! 

More live music made a huge change for the good. Also, more workouts overall is a improvement. Came back to see how it is going. Still have the same complaints as above but with the changes so far it's a little more likeable. I am happy you give another week free with new head set. I appreciate that a TON, Thank you. Can we at least split the complaints and let us purchase single songs from our favorite artist? Don't care the trainer."
526,Alixtime,Jul 11 at 10:31 PM,1,How do you cancel this?!,I’ve tried for months to cancel this and it keeps popping back up. When I look up how to cancel it says go to the subscription button and hit cancel but there is no button. Can someone please help?
527,France Bezeau,Jun 12 at 5:40 PM,5,I Love it so much,"I don't regret buying. At first I thought it was expensive but when I trained with it, wow I can not stopped.  I've lost 23 pounds.  I've made a lot of changes in my diet too. But all together it's perfect.  And the coaches are good, motivators.  It's a lot of money at first but at the end for me it's the same as if I pay a Gym for a year and I hate going at a Gym... I do supernatural and my other fitness at home.  LOVE IT"
528,Tasha,Jun 11 at 9:17 PM,5,Ex couch potato,"I used having 2 small children as an excuse to not workout for so long until I decided to give VR a try. Even with an infant and toddler I manage to get at least an hour in. I look forward to working out now even when my legs hurt and arms feel like they will fall off. I don’t care because I am truly addicted. It’s worth the price in my opinion. It got me, a dedicated coach potato up and moving and looking to add even more activity in my life now. Truly a blessing to have!!!"
529,HeyDeFamGang,Jun 17 at 8:45 PM,4,I like it but read...TOO EXPENSIVE!!!,"I really like the workouts plus the scenery and music! But as most reviews have said...TOO EXPENSIVE! Look I get it, I appreciate the work and money that goes into this app and the music rights, we get it. But if it had a better price point they would naturally  get more subs. Who is their accountant? DO the math...10K subs at $20/month is less revenue than 50K subs at $7.99/month ( a price I think a lot of people would consider). Their revenue would go up and subs would likely stay longer. READ THE REVIEWS! Why are they pushing 70-80% of potential subs out, does not make sense. When everyone says your app is amazing but TOO EXPENSIVE? HELLLLO??? It is too bad because it is a great experience."

532,K,Jun 14 at 5:05 PM,1,179.00 required subscription,"I  naively downloaded this game , and followed along 
As instructed and lined up
A username and   password  than profile . Quick as a Cobra I’m pressed to an annual subscription of a cost no less than 180.00$. No pay I’m no play ! 
I’m still shocked  how this type of business practice 
Was incorporated with your product ."
533,C M Williams,Jul 28 at 6:48 AM,1,I’d give it zero if I could,The only thing worse than this overpriced app is the hour it took of my life trying to cancel it. I’ve had cheaper gym memberships. How they can justify the monthly fee is beyond me.
534,Mishy,Jun 9 at 6:30 PM,5,A lot of FUN!,"I just wanted to say, that this workout app is super fun! I did not like the idea of having to pay each month, but after trying it ONE time yesterday I will be paying. I sweated so bad my clothes were drenched and that never happens by just working out or going to the gym. I felt awesome and did not want to stop and was able to keep going. You are at home for one, not around other people and you get to see around the world which is cool too. I really can't wait to workout again today. Also some people have said that the coaches talk too much and they do,  but I felt super motivated by them. It didn't bother me at all. But to each their own. 

The ONLY CON I have is; I really wish they had an option to add your weight and track the weight loss you have made. That would be awesome! 
Hope this is seen by someone and they add that. 

But over all super fun and worth the money!! Just do the trial and find out for yourself."
535,KevinDerrick,Jul 31 at 8:13 PM,1,Frustrating server!!,I used it once for the tutorial. Quit one time. Then it won’t load anymore! Always server is disconnected wait for it to be fixed. It’s been 2 days. Haaaay
536,Tacowin,Jun 9 at 2:50 AM,5,Don't let cost deter you!,"This app is awesome. I know the cost may seem steep, however, the cost for a year is $179...cheaper than a gym membership. So here's the upside. Fun and entertaining coaches, new workout EVERY DAY so it never gets boring. Beautiful scenery, great music from pop to country. Great variety. You don't have to waste gas or time going to a gym. Most fun you'll have doing a working out. So much fun u will look forward to the next workout! You can save all of your favorite workouts. A super supportive community. Listen if you have money to buy an oculus then u can save for this program. SOOOOOO worth it. You won't be disappointed."

539,Connor,Aug 3 at 6:34 AM,5,Amazing,I love boxing and this is great for that
540,DrTinaBND,Jun 8 at 7:39 AM,5,Worth the money…,"I workout everyday now, sometimes twice a day…and I am dripping wet when I finished. It’s much more affordable than a gym membership and I don’t have to leave my house or spend hours working out. Plus the workouts are fun. The locations/views are amazing. The music is fantastic. And the coaches are great too. So glad you guys added meditation and stretches.  I really enjoy this device. This is literally the only app I’ve purchased. And did I mention I use every day."
541,Andipoop,Jun 10 at 4:11 AM,5,"Love, Love…LOVE!!!","Supernatural has become my new go to after work and before I get started for the day on weekends. Love the workouts, coaches and meditations! If you don’t already have this app WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR…. $179 for a whole year! With multiple coaches and workouts. Absolutely phenomenal."
542,SheriLane,Jun 20 at 11:11 PM,5,Spiritual Joyful with Excellent Music,"I absolutely love this app. It’s fun and uplifting with a variety of workouts, inspiring meditations, and excellent music.

544,María,Jul 1 at 9:47 AM,1,"Not available in Aus, still charged!","Tried to sign up for the trial, it didn’t allow me, as the app is “not available in your country”. Fair enough. What’s not fair, is that apparently they DID sign me up for the trial and they charged me for a full year, even though I still can’t use the app here in Australia! They like my Australian dollars enough though.."
545,MudBug,"May 3, 2022 at 2:10 AM",5,Life Changing!,So good I WANT to work out every day and have to hold myself back so I don't over do it. And it's more than just a workout. The coaches bring so much motivating positivity and humor that I feel better about myself. If you join the Official Supernatural Community on FB you will get a double whammy of support and good vibes from a group of people who are on the same road. This app is worth every penny. I'm a 61 y/o female and there are plenty of older and younger folks punching and swinging their way to a better life on this app. Cheers to your best self!
546,skylaar,Jun 28 at 7:38 AM,4,"Great fun, except after an update.","I really enjoy the app and use it an average of three times a week. I general start with a boxing session or two and follow it with 1-2 flows to keep the cardio up. Overall I love the workout routines and the commentary is motivating but I do agree with another user that sometimes it would be nice to turn it off and throw down some punches. Favorite boxing mix is Fuego!

I take off a star because it seems like every other update there is a bug where it will pause during the first or second song and upon resuming it will go to a black screen forcing me to fully restart the application. I thought it was do to sleep mode so I have been fully shutting the system off after a workout but it still happens. Previous update, never happened. The update before that and now this one today for Katy Perry and the bug is back. Frustrating because you are almost through the first song or working on your second and now… no credit and there goes the 100% goal."
547,Venus,Jun 19 at 6:41 PM,1,I agree with whiteja,"Like she said more people would join if the price was more affordable giving you guys more revenue. I get an amazing workout with Fitxr and they charge nothing also les Mills body combat charge 10 bucks monthly. I would love to have you guys as well but I'm seeing you have some shady business practices, automatically charging customers the yearly fee after trial period has ended. Wow! After my trial period with LM body combat  it just ended no automatically charging customers, you enroll on your own."
548,Hodgeygal,Jul 26 at 3:54 PM,5,"Beautiful, challenging, fun",My favorite game by far- worth every.single.penny.
549,Marifer,Jun 28 at 8:15 AM,3,Really disappointed,"I paid a whole year subscription living in the US. Needed to come to México and seems like now I can't use the app here, I paid a whole year for just 1 month of service 🙁 I literally bought the Oculus because of this app and can't believe I paid almost $200 dollars for a month, I'm really disappointed, need a refund for this, or help to make it work , it's really the best app I have ever had."
550,Leonard Menchiari,Jun 16 at 8:18 PM,2,Not free,"This is just a money maker scam. Nothing new, bad experiences, and to save budget adds a bunch of royalty free classical music masking it as ""great workout music"". Other than the beautiful scenaries I can't recommend, but in that case just use Google Earth VR. Worse thing is that in order to try it you're forced to buy a $20 subscription with no refund option. Try other workout apps, this one is very mediocre."
551,Shy,Jul 23 at 9:08 PM,4,,I love this app! The workouts are fun and make you feel accomplished afterwards.  Only issue i have is my Samsung Active 2 watch cannot connect to the heart tracker.
552,Killgirl211,Jul 1 at 1:56 AM,5,Love it!,"Got a trial from a friend and was hooked. Yes, it is a bit pricey but it is worth it! They release new content so frequently and there are so many options to keep it fresh!"
553,Zeb,Jun 25 at 9:26 AM,5,Sweat on!,30mins on drenched in sweat. Kickass cardio! Worth it and the new content is great. I paid 20 a month for gym membership and now it’s cancelled cuz this is better and slightly cheaper by 60 annually.
554,InvisibleNotBroken,Jun 25 at 2:10 AM,1,Update can’t access,I got a subscription I cannot access it will not let me sign in and for some reason it thinks that while we’re in a headset I should be able to also be able to look at my phone this is very difficult it’s super frustrating I am canceling because it should be way easier than this to get an app and use an app that you paid for
555,CPEStevenson,Jun 25 at 4:50 PM,1,Cancelled due to propaganda,"I had a subscription for almost a year and enjoyed the app. It was a good, fun way to loosen up and sweat a little. I just cancelled due to the developers pushing the LGBTQ+ nonsense. My kid would play Supernatural on occasion, and now I can't trust you to keep things wholesome. Keep your politics and kinks to yourself if you want my money, groomers."
556,William Shane Knopp,Jun 7 at 12:30 AM,1,Bait and switch,It’s not a free demo. You have to sign up for a 14 day free trial. Give them your info and then remember to cancel if you don’t like. Why do that? If it’s a demo then allow people to demo it. Reeks of fraud. How do I cancel my trial subscription?
557,Pandas 424,Jun 21 at 6:33 AM,1,,"It's good but it's sad that you have to have a subscription, an expensive one at that. If you worked out for a while every day, then it might be worth it, but if you don't work out often, it's very pricey. It would also be nice to have a one time payment option but there isn't one."
558,Gutterballs,Aug 7 at 12:47 AM,1,Misleading,If you’re going to say its free but have a subscription at least have a single ounce of free content or make the free trial not some gotcha bs where you forget to cancel.
559,Frida Consuela,"Feb 25, 2022 at 7:50 PM",4,"Highly Recommend. AMAZING app, BUT...","PROS:  Super fun and addictive app that makes you actually want to exercise... whether you're a beginner or seasoned athlete! Great assortment of workouts/training levels, music genres, trainers, and fitness tracking bells & whistles, etc. You really feel like you are exercising all over the world, and it's REALLY COOL. This is a great concept and app, and I highly recommend it!
NOTE TO THE DEVS - PLEASE WORK ON THE FOLLOWING ISSUES:
CONS: 1) Some trainers talk too much throughout the workouts. I think the instruction is great (and valuable in the beginning), but when the trainers start telling you their personal stories... for me, the amount of talk is too excessive. For experienced users, it becomes irritating to hear the same chatter over and over when you do the same workout multiple times (because you like the music playlist). Lowering the trainer voice is not sufficient. I realize that some people might enjoy the talk, but users should be given the option to MUTE the trainer if they just want to listen to the music and focus on the workout ""without talk"". 2) Give the user the option to SKIP songs. After a few months of use, I'm finding myself playing the first few songs and switching from workout to workout to avoid listening to songs that I dislike. It's very demotivating to have to jump around in the app when you just want to stay focused on continuing the workout. I get really bummed when I see my favorite songs in the middle or at the end of a workout, because I know that I won't suffer through 3-4 songs I dislike to get to the songs that I DO like. Being able to skip songs would be an easy fix. What would be even better: Give the user the option to create their own playlist from the music and trainers already available. I can't be the only one who'd like to mix up music genres in their workout! 3) Lastly, I noticed you guys sneaking in a few ads in the trainer chatter. This is unacceptable... especially when your user is already paying a substancial monthly subscription. This is the first time I've experienced the suggestion of advertising in any app so far, and it really grated on my nerves. Frankly, between not being able to mute trainers and skip songs... then the ad sneak... I started looking into other apps that don't have these issues. Again, this app is AMAZING and original and so close to perfect... but it absolutely needs to add the ability to skip songs and fully mute the trainers for users who don't enjoy the talk over the music. Allowing users to make customized song playlists and even customized workouts (mixing flow and boxing songs) would keep me using this app indefinitely and would be a perk many users would love and appreciate."
560,PiLuca,Oct 12 at 2:01 AM,2,Just not a justifiable expense,"I truly liked supernatural a lot but the price is ridiculous. I would consider paying maybe a 60 dollar annual fee for this. Maybe a 7 dollar monthly fee. But anything more seems like highway robbery.
It's a nice app but the price doesn't make sense."

Then about four weeks ago I kept running into problems every time I try to explore new workouts it kept crashing. Very frustrating especially since I’m paying for something that I’m not getting. So today I canceled it hopefully they will refund me my June subscription since I can’t use the program
564,Melanie Machete,"Apr 24, 2022 at 4:34 AM",5,Cult of the century 😵‍💫😵‍💫,They have an eclectic playlist from 90’s dance to Kendrick Lamar to SLIPKNOT.

And I’m literally DRIPPING from my face/chin, shirt soaked, self-monitoring to ensure I’m not having a heart attack.  Love the trainers, they always seem to know what to chime in & otherwise let the music play.  Excited for this to be my game changer! 🙌"
568,Joe748,"Apr 19, 2022 at 6:57 AM",4,Great game. Subscription too expensive.,This is a great workout app it’s really fun and the music is really good I definitely feel happier after using it.  But $19/mo is just too much.  I’m sure those music licenses aren’t cheap but $19/mo is more than most steaming services!  A planet fitness membership is $10 month and you have way more variety in the gym.  Hopefully they can get more funding and be able to lower it to $15 or $10/month.  $15/mo I would strongly consider it $10/mo I would be sold.
569,Jessie,Jul 20 at 10:17 AM,1,How can you charge me for a subscription,When the app is not available in my country! Please refund immediately!
570,Trodicus Prime,"Jan 25, 2022 at 11:05 PM",5,Totally impressed,"I’m still on the 7 day trial. As I knew I couldn’t really afford it in this moment, I wanted to check it out as I have been using Beat Saber to get my cardio going. Reviews convinced me to give it a try as I also use Thrill of the Fight for my boxing fun and cardio. When I first saw the subscription price I was like ‘nah’, but I still wanted to see for myself. As someone who loves visuals, this apps locations are amazing. Right away, I knew the subscription is worth it and why it’s priced as it is. I would use a different pricing scheme, but this one will only delay my eventual purchase (or maybe something better may come along that fits my current situation better - starts cheaper and increases over time…). That said, I am blown away. For me, it’s the variety, quality, and coaches. The meditation is just the icing on the cake. If I had a gym membership I would cancel it for this. I plan to cancel my Netflix and stop my casual smoking as that will free up the $20/month. I will miss this for a time but will make up for it with the aforementioned titles until I can absorb the expense and be sure I will follow through. But let me say, as a person who does not comment unless I can say something wonderful; this app is bomb. Zuck should be very happy as this type of content makes the oculus shine. Now on to Tai Chi. Maybe Super Natural can incorporate Tai Chi? Anyway, thanks so much for this app and thanks for reading."

The sceneries are stupendous, you never feel locked in your room, it is a breath of fresh air everywhere around the planet remembering us how beautiful it is and how privileged we are. I get to discover new songs I would never have listened too, or old ones I had forgotten. I wish everyone around the world had access to Supernatural and here comes me hating it too because when I move out of the USA: bye bye Supernatural. Why so cruel 😢 help! Please! do something! You coaches are too fantastic! We don’t need translations (French speaking native here!)  just let us move around the world! Let me be in your corner always! Much love 😉"

This app keeps me motivated and moving.
The words of the coaches have helped heal my spirit after a long difficult journey. The meditations are also amazing. 
I am, now, off of blood pressure meds. I am more mindful of how I treat my body because I am worth it. 

At first, I was put off by the monthly subscription, but new workouts and music are added every day. There's something special about this app that makes me want to get into the headset. IMHO, it is worth every penny of the subscription price."
579,WhatBS,"May 24, 2022 at 6:45 AM",4,Grown To Love It,"Here is my update. 

Although I had a rocky start, and although some of the coach talking still annoys me, I have grown to love Supernatural. I have noticed so many benefits from using it almost daily for about forty minutes a time. I love the boxing for letting off steam and I love Flow for just moving in general and the music. The scenery is awesome. I have some physical limitations and I really appreciate that the settings are adaptable for those. Some of my lower body muscles are very weak after surgeries but I can feel them getting stronger for the first time in a very long time, and I have tried and tried to make that happen with no success until now. I also feel the same in my upper body. And I love to sweat during a workout. Supernatural gives me that. I’ve noticed my posture has improved and I feel aerobically fitter too. So, I’m a fan, and having a lot of fun with it.  Looking forward to future developments! 


The constant chatter of the coaches is a dealbreaker for me. Who wants to listen to someone talking over the music you’re trying to listen to? Not me. It ruins the whole experience. The workouts are not rocket science. There is no need for the repetition after tyr first couple of times. There isn’t even a way to to turn the music offf entirely for meditation. You still have to have the bass tones. So I’ll part ways with Supernatural once my trial is up. Too bad, because otherwise it's a lot of fun—justruined by that one detail."

I don’t mind the price especially after seeing results. The music is fun and they have a good variety. This app is life changing , and I’m not being overly dramatic I promise, you’ll see definite results! Get it, you will not be disappointed. ￼"
588,Lisa,Jun 20 at 5:51 AM,3,Needs some work,I do enjoy supernatural but for the price of the subscription you should be able to skip songs and also mute the commentary. There are times that I turn off a workout because the coach talks too much.

I've been doing this almost daily for 4 months and actually look forward to it because it's FUN! I've lost over 30 lbs and my husband has lost over 50.
It's well worth the subscription fee, we've both spent more for gym memberships we hardly used and hated going to that did nothing for us.
I have so many new muscles being built that I never knew I had. It doesn't just work out your arms and legs: I have a solid core now that I'd never have had without this. I haven't had to change my diet much because these new muscles mean I am burning more calories in my everyday life.
It feels great to have the mobility back that I hadn't even really realized I had lost. We both feel fantastic and accomplished. It's a wonderful feeling and you need this in your life."
592,Guri,"May 29, 2022 at 11:51 PM",3,Good but costly,"I like the app, not gonna lie. But am put off by the price. To be honest, I am ok with monthly subscription model too but 20$ is a bit too much than what I am willing to pay. I understand they are working on upgrading workouts and songs regularly which incurs costs but I am sure there is a better price point than this which works too. I also get that they want to see themselves as gym replacement but I don't think that's apples to apples comparison. All you can replace is cardio workout. Might consider in future if pricing changes."

597,Ryan,"May 24, 2022 at 6:48 PM",1,Cancelling Trial Membership Is Hard,"I ended up getting billed 5 times after thinking I had cancelled my membership. Ironically because my partner has a membership, and I thought the charges were from her account (they weren't), I didn't catch it in time, and that's the reason neither Supernatural nor Mastercard will fully refund the transactions. In total I lost $73.55 CAD for about 2 minutes of gameplay. I checked my google history and I did visit the membership page and I remember clicking cancel. They don't email you when you're being billed so you won't know unless you check your credit card statement. 

Trial users beware!

Update May 24, 2022: As advised by the developer response, I forwarded their response to supernatural support. As expected, they still won't refund the money. A few other complaints worth noting as well. Despite taking the money, they call the refund a ""courtesy"" (feels like gaslighting to me, but we can just call that whitewashing). Also note they're just wasting my time at this point, with additional whitewashing attempts. After all, if they respond to the review, they must care, right? So now I'm out my $73.55, but also I'm feeling emotionally manipulated and having my time wasted. So warning to anyone following suit: If you leave a negative review, and they respond, it's probably just a bot or template response."
598,Vrlonewolf,"May 19, 2022 at 8:39 PM",5,Newer workouts music,"I have to say, in many of the latest new workouts for boxing, the quality of musical selections have gone down in my opinion

Too many workouts feature music devoid of melody, or any good beat

I want music that will make me want to move, not put me to sleep

There is a place for hip hop, EDM, rap, but not in a workout

There must be a vast library of songs out there that you can sing along to, and dance to also

Just my thoughts"
599,Amy,"May 20, 2022 at 12:27 AM",5,Changed my life,"Update 5/22: just over a year and half now and I’m still loving this app! Everything I said in this review below still stands.  I’ve lost weight and built muscle, I’ve never felt better! 

I waited a few weeks to look into this app when I first bought my oculus in July.  Only because I was brand new to VR.  And now I’m kicking myself for waiting.  This work out app has changed my life.  I’ve spent all of my life dealing with weight and body image.  Up and down.  And the struggle is real when your over 40 to find something that is easy on your joints and makes you sweat.  And this is exactly what SN is.  It’s workouts set to motivating songs with positive and fun support not only from the coaches but the community.  I highly recommend joining the Facebook group.  Never have been so motivated or seen a more supportive group of people.   No judgment. Just love.  The coaches are fantastic.  This app may not be for the seasoned cross fit type folk.  But for me, overweight and terrified of exercising in public for fear of fat bashing and judgement, this app and community that comes with it has been utterly amazing.  I’ve lost some weight.  I feel better.  I feel like I can do this.  I look forward to it every day.  This has been a crap year.  The monthly fee is nothing,  absolutely insignificant, compared to the positive impact and change it has given me.  Thank you coaches and all who created this app!"
600,Keilah,"May 20, 2022 at 4:58 PM",5,100% Worth It,"I'm super self conscious about working out in front of people, so this is the perfect solution! The work outs are really fun (especially the boxing), the music is great, and you feel like you've gotten a real workout. I thought the instructors were a bit hokey at first but it's honestly kinda nice to have them cheer you on and give you pointers. It's like Beat Saber with better music, a personal cheerleader, and you sweat your t*ts off."
601,Susan,"May 20, 2022 at 5:04 AM",5,We’re good,"I purchased free trial for 14 days. Yesterday it worked fine. Today remote would not work. The remote was fine on other tasks. Not on anything on this game. I tried every possible ways to get answered to this problem. I found no way to get in touch with anyone. I wrestled with the help questions. Nothing.  Unfortunately I canceled my subscription. This was the only reason I purchased the Meta Quest II.  Unsure of what else I could do. 
Update,  everything is good. 
Thank you for the prompt response."
602,Elton,Jun 10 at 3:59 PM,4,Amazing workouts. And perfectly executed,"Very motivating and lots of variety of workouts. The locations are breathtaking and the workouts are good Overall good but 4 stars because it seems the balls are flying at you randomly, especially on Hard workouts. It seems like it's hard because soamy balls fly at you at the same time. It would be nice it the balls came with the rhythm of the music, and narrated that way as well. And repeat a combo 2, 3 or 4 times, because repetition works too. Also, definitely more squatting to work the legs. Got a good thing going, hoping those tweaks will be added!"
603,Plum117,Jul 9 at 6:10 AM,4,Great!,"Was finally able to buy/try and I was surprised. It is pretty fun. I was sure not to pay for it but now, I will really try it and I'm thinking to continue and buy it."
604,Katie l,"May 17, 2022 at 10:12 PM",5,Love this!,I love everything about supernatural! It forces me to get active and stay active.I love the trainers and how fun they make the workouts!I wish there was more modern music as much as the older music and I wish their was more country and maybe even Christian music!oh and the scenery and ability to be in such beautiful locations is definitely a huge bonus!and how you can adjust the workout to the level your at is awesome!
605,Furaha,Jun 10 at 5:47 AM,1,Easy in- no exit,"They make it so hard to cancel subscription which may not be available if you’re traveling to some international destinations - this led to months of waste for me.
It is much too expensive to keep anyway."
606,Joce,"May 23, 2022 at 6:36 PM",3,Too much talking!,"I just started my 2 week trial and I love the workouts. There is one pretty big issue for me that could stop me from purchasing the full subscription though...

My only concern is that the instructors talk through the entire workouts. I struggle with keeping my focus on the workout when the instructor is constantly in my ear, a lot of what they say has nothing to do with the workout and is more of that annoying workout instructor banter. That is why I don't like going to group fitness classes- must be my ADD but it drives me crazy. 

Is there anyway to turn the instructor off so I can enjoy my workouts in peace? I figured out how to turn their volume down, but not completely off..."

It’s been so good for me to get me through the winter months. I’ve lost over 10 pounds with this and walking. Definitely do yourself the favor and get this!!"
614,Lacy,"Apr 26, 2022 at 3:25 AM",1,Doesn't work with slower internet,"I LOVED supernatural. Was really enjoying it. They forced an update, which only works with fast internet. I live in the woods near an air force base and the internet sucks. I reached out and after going back and forth, they said they're working on it. I Uninstalled the app (at their request) and canceled my subscription. Received an email that they fixed it. You can't even try the app without a subscription,  so I had to purchase the monthly again just to find out that it's still not working. So disappointed.  It's a really great game if your internet is strong enough. **UPDATE** we changed internet providers and got a faster internet.  The game works great! My suggestion: check your internet speed before you pay for the subscription!"

616,Lacey,"May 13, 2022 at 11:47 PM",5,Former horizontal runner…,"I was an avid horizontal runner. I swore I’d never love something else as much… but then, Christmas morning 2020 I wrangled the Oculus from a whiny child and experienced a workout routine I would continue consistently for 10 months, drop 57 lbs, improve my range of motion and support my mental health better than I have in my entire life. 

At first the monthly subscription of $20 seemed outrageous but it’s a small price to pay for what I have gained. Not to mention the amazing music I can sing and dance along with. So much better than that awful royalty free music others use."
617,Jeff,"Mar 15, 2022 at 9:38 PM",4,I hate the subscription model but…,"I will preface this by saying I am very anti-subscription when it comes to apps on here. I had a 30-day free trial so I thought I would give it a shot. 

It’s a really great app. Boxing and flow are both fun and provide a great workout. I also like all the scenic backdrops. 

My only minor cons would be I wish it was easier to search for certain music, and also I am in my late 40’s and I wish there was more 70s and 80s music included. 

As much as I enjoy it I have a hard time validating a $19 monthly subscription. I already have Les Mills Bodycombat which is very similar to boxing on Supernatural. If it was a large one-time purchase, or even a smaller subscription price ($9.99 maybe?) I would likely bite but it’s hard to shell out $200/year for this. 

Five stars for the app itself, minus one for the subscription model."

619,Kate,"Apr 8, 2022 at 10:37 AM",5,Best workout game ever,I hated working out on my whole life until this game. It’s so fun so addicting and it gets you moving I’m looking forward every single day to having fun and moving to the beats .  I think my goal of losing weight is finally gonna be successful this time . Sure wish it was a little less expensive a month but the fact that you don’t have to leave your house and pay for the gym membership I say it’s worth it .
620,Richard Hoban,"May 29, 2022 at 11:21 AM",5,Nice,If you want to get a great leg workout try the first 4 songs of “super monster ‘full bodied beast’” with coach Mark. I try to do those 4 songs regularly and it still almost puts tears in my eyes. Thank me later
621,Chapulin,Jun 3 at 8:17 AM,3,Not immersive,"Wanted to like this and I did, but not enough to pay a monthly fee. I think this is good enough for a one time fee. For the subscription I looked for two things, one live classes that you join at a specific time or two an immersive environment that was developed beyond google maps. For one I did not find a live class option. For two there is no fish in the water and the grass doesn’t move, so it doesn’t feel real just like you are hovering above a beautiful photo. The trainings are good and motivating that may be enough for others, but since I have other games that have boxing, lazer swords and even scenery and those are one time fee, this did not hit the above the rest enough to pay a monthly rate."
622,Darkluck,Jun 3 at 3:06 AM,3,Great program with obnoxious cost,"Pro- it makes it fun to work out and makes you want to work out and the music is better than it’s closest competitors. You hate missing working out on this or the other program.
Con- considering it’s by far the most expensive program, it’s obnoxious that I can’t share it between my sons unit and mine. Every other program allows this and we aren’t sharing units due to Covid. So I had to give the program up to him and can’t use it anymore . You can switch it back and forth limited times
For the money I’m sticking with the other program which gives a better workout although the music isn’t as good.
Ideally I’d keep supernatural as a warmup but not unless they fix these issues."
623,Labell,Jun 3 at 8:52 PM,5,Great Workout,"Excellent workout that doesn't feel like you are exercising.  Great music choices, choreography and coaches.   It was great to use different intensity workouts to get in shape again."

I love the energy and the enthusiasm in the training squad! That is exactly what I’ve been looking for. I usually do my work outs with beat saber, synth rider and Box XR and a few other ones on occasion. But I needed something new to try to get me motivated again. I am so happy because I need to keep going with my weight loss. This summer is going to be a blast on vr workouts!"

629,Zagfan,"Jan 3, 2022 at 3:40 AM",5,"This is long, but worth it…","Pandemic…blah blah blah. Here’s the scoop for those people who want to take their game to the next level. Turned my garage into the local gym. My wife and I (both 45) worked our butts off for the last 18 months and I lost about 50 pounds doing Les Mills body pump and body combat and freaking spin bikes. I’m not a little guy so dropping from 265 to 215 is pretty exciting. Met my abs for the first time, we’re pretty happy with each other so far. Hoping for a long term relationship. These workouts burn between 500 and 725 calories per 55 minute session and they are tough. Anyway, I got an Oculus quest 2 for my teen girls…yeah I know, WTH but it was the thought that counts. Well I’ve stolen it back from them and converted it to “my precious” that they might getting to have visitation with if they’re good. So back to the story…here I am on a Sunday morning  not feeling super stoked about sitting on a spin bike. I say to myself, what was that boxing app you downloaded…oh that’s right Supernatural. Pulled up a couple YouTube videos and said let’s give it a go. After a fairly simple setup about 20 minutes to get everything figured out, I’ve got this thing strapped to my face…the girls are strictly forbidden from taking pictures of my in such a compromising state…and off we go! Started off easy to get the hang of it, and quickly progressed to the high intensity Flow and boxing sessions, one after the other for 2 hours, sweat pouring, heart pounding, singing like an idiot and hoping I don’t stroke out. Took a brake to make sure I wasn’t in trouble for leaving the family unattended, grabbed a quick Orgain shake and WENT BACK OUT TO THE GYM. Are you kidding me right now? I just burned 1096 calories and was absolutely stoked to get back to it. So, after another 1:15 hours of signing and dancing like a Finalist on Dancing with the Stars with swords in my hands, I finally had to call it before I collapsed. Another 866 calories down! Listen, I’ve been crushing my workouts for 18 months, I can lift heavy weights, run a long way, go climb a rock wall or punch the hell out of a shadow, BUT I HAVE NEVER HAD SO MUCH FUN than when I did these workouts! There is no question that this workout will become a new staple in the routine. The hard part will be stopping and actually going to work. I LOVE THIS PROGRAM."
630,Ashley Anderson,"May 31, 2022 at 9:19 AM",2,Needs much improvement,"Some workouts are FIRE AND THE BEST.. but then there’s a lot that suuuuuuuuck. I agree with most other comments
We need to be able to mute the trainer. 
We need to be able to skip unliked songs
Also I hate it when I go through a work out and I dislike it so much that I will rate it a 1 out of 5 then, because it’s hard to tell what the work out will be until I’m in it, I sometimes end up re-playing that same list that I gave a low rating on!! 
WHY CANT I SEE HOW I RATED THE WORKOUTS SO I KNOW NOT TO REVISIT IT? It is totally upsetting… I don’t see the rating that I already gave until AFTER THE WORK OUT IS OVER AND THE STATISTICS/score is displayed.
And I’m also finding it so strange how some medium level workout are way more of a work out then some of the high level intensity ones. For example the most recent workout for BreakUp ShapeUp released today 5/30 felt like a low level of intensity… there was no intensity and I felt bored. 
My favorite trainer is Leanne Pedante and I love doing High Flow workouts that are anything but country and rock…. With these filters my options to choose a best work out go down significantly. From a 100+ options to like 10. 
My biggest issue tho is the intensity of high doesn’t feel like it’s very hard and sometimes it’s even the opposite. 
And for the amount I pay every month I want more of a challenge! ;)"

I’ve become a huge fan of the boxing work out, but there is just not enough playlist with modern day music. I enjoy current pop and Latin hit and it’s very focused on older music. I’ve debated to cancel the membership just because i feel like I’m working out over the same playlist. Wish there was just more modern day playlist for boxing."

646,Bill,"May 8, 2022 at 8:35 AM",2,"Starts out amazing, becomes boring","Like most people who have left a review, I was amazed that a ""workout"" could be fun....

I was actually looking forward to using supernatural and probably played it everyday for the first 2 weeks.....then I started to notice all it's shortcomings

First, like alot of reviews say, you can NOT silence the trainers.....so when you find a workout that you enjoy, they say the exact same thing over and over again......its annoying

Second, the workout playlists are preset....you can NOT alter them in anyway......so if a song you LOVE is at the end of a 39 minute workout, then you must do the entire workout the hear it

Third, you can NOT alter the intensity of a workout.....so if you find a playlist you like, but the intensity is higher or lower that your preferred level, you can not make it easier or harder......

Even the most basic rhythm games have these type of features.....why not supernatural?

I WAS a subscriber for 3 months......but if I can pick my songs, the intensity of my workouts and silence the trainers, you will never get another penny from me..

If you want a good workout without a subscription, try Les Mills body combat.....or PowerBeatsVR ....with power beats VR you can upload all your own songs, make your own playlists and adjust the intensity of your workouts......with NO subscription and NO trainers talking over your music"
647,Rojas,Jun 10 at 4:13 AM,5,Expensive,Really enjoyed and I think it works 100% kn your body but $18 dollars ? More than a gym membership.
648,Brian,"Apr 30, 2022 at 10:15 AM",5,Premium app / even at about 13 a mo,"Supernatural is the best fitness app out there. YES you need a subscription BUT you get what you pay for, other apps I use, such as Les Mills which doesn’t have a subscription and you can see the difference as the content is in LMills is EXTREMELY lacking. SNF has great coaches, great music and great scenes to perform your workout.  Not to mention the meditation and stretching. LMs has no stretch and I’ve pulled some muscles a few times. Get this app, and if you need a guest pass find me and I will gift you one so that you can try it out. You can transform your life and health with SNF

Edit — I have noticed a lot reviews of which say the subscription is high, if you pay monthly, BUT if you get a guess pass and pay for the year it turns about to be 13 a month which I feel is a good value for the content that is supplied."
649,Orion,"May 21, 2022 at 4:03 AM",4,Thoughts and feature suggestions,"$20 is pretty steep but I appreciate the diverse content and the frequency of new content. 

Feature request(s):

Allow adjusting the platform after the app has started. I have a limited space that allows  for full movement and the app just puts the platform where ever it wants rather in the center of the defined boundary. 

Also custom playlists would be great. I know that would mess with the flow of the trainer but it would be nice."
650,Vincent Magnus,"Apr 29, 2022 at 1:06 AM",5,Great aerobic workout!,"I really like this app. I use it two or three times a week and really enjoy it. It's fun and a great aerobic exercise. They are always adding new content and have a good collection from different genres of popular music. Also, working out in exotic environments is awesome! I'd recommend for everyone to try this app. Probably the future of aerobics classes, right here."
651,Luci,"May 23, 2022 at 8:26 PM",1,Supernatural,I signed up for the free trial and didn't like it like I thought I would. I canceled before the free trial is over but they charged me anyway. Now I have to go through the trouble of trying to get my money back. Not happy!!!
652,Alexis,Jun 8 at 7:03 AM,4,Love it,I would have given this game five stars. But I can’t it’s a great game the only issue I have is I wish it cost less. And I wish they had more than the selection that it has. But all in all it’s great
653,Jarmago,"Apr 27, 2022 at 1:22 PM",5,Beautiful scenery,"Update: Since my initial trial, i tried again and saw they had added a boxing format. It was a deal clincher. Very fun. I typically box with Coach Doc as he has boxing experience.  I have nothing negative to say about this game. However, the option to pick 5 or 10 a la carte workouts would be awesome for a few reasons - 1. Music motivates me, and if i could put my favs together in one workout, i would move harder, workout longer, and workout more often. 2. It would save me time having to search for songs or switch workouts to workout to the songs i know will motivate me. 3. It would give me the opportunity to mix and match genres, formats, and intensities. Maybe the developers will hear our requests. Not a dealbreaker, but it would be nice to have a little more flexibility, especially since it is subscrption game. Other than that, no complaints. 

Original: I just wrapped up the 30 day trial.  Regarding the game itself, i really liked the scenery. It was absolutely beautiful.  The workouts of varying difficulty levels were enjoyable and definitely get your heart pumping and keep you moving by using a bat to hit targets with squats and lunges (via triangles) mixed in. I found it hard to move with the triangles and would have liked obstacles instead, but that isn’t a deterrent, just a preference. There are also meditation and stretching workouts, but i didn’t take advantage of those during my trial. The instructors were fine, but i didn’t find them necessary. While i enjoyed and appreciate the trial, the game didn’t keep me coming back enough to warrant a monthly membership charge. Like many others, i would purchase a limited version of the game that included upgrade packages; hopefully something that will be offered in the future. I thank the developers for the trial and wish you all the success."
654,Orleatha,"May 14, 2022 at 4:39 AM",5,Seriously fun!,This is the only  movement that I have been able to  be consistent with! I have a home gym with one of those fancy bikes but this is the only thing that is fun enough to stick with. Get this app. No regrets here!

656,Ante,"Jan 8, 2022 at 3:09 PM",5,Addicting workout that feels fun,"Using this game to get all abs to show right now and a more defined jawline, doing one hour a day for around 350 calories burned at 150lb. I will list the positives and negatives below.

Positives

-fun and gets your mind off of the workout portion, instead you focus on the music and gets you immersed in the world

-high calories burned compared to other games like beat saber, this is because there are more squats to every song

-coaches feel like they're actually there so you're listening to them actively, better than some games like Fitxr with coaches that don't say much 

-new daily workouts with good songs mean there is a good reason to check it daily

-overall addicting, can't explain this perfectly but I've came back to this game more than Fitxr

Negatives

-no leaderboards, I know you can add a few people and compete, but it's not the same as a global leaderboard. this may be done on purpose because the game is focused on a good workout, not a perfect score

-lack of scoring clarity, no setting to show points on screen, no positive feedback if you are beating your previous scores, this discourages replaying levels you liked before

-no consequences to not being inside the triangles or touching the bars in boxing, knowing there's no reason to avoid them because it doesn't cut your score means less reason to actively avoid them

-lack of competition overall, which is confusing since the coaches always encourage you to try your best effort, but with lack of leaderboard or scoring clarity or penalties, any competitiveness is not here, would be good to see an option for this

-no playlists and no easy way to find songs you like, I have to look through every workout to find songs I like to listen to, this means a lot of time wasted just scrolling through, sometimes five minutes before I find a song I know, but having to avoid the second song I don't"
657,Geo,Jun 10 at 10:48 AM,1,App & subscription,"Great app
But as for the subscription, guys you are CRAZY no other words"
658,Diana,"May 16, 2022 at 4:40 AM",4,Lacking options,"Even though I think it’s pretty fun, I feel it’s lacking options. 
1. It would be awesome if we could choose the songs we workout to and create a custom “playlist”
2. Multi-player option (like in BeatSaber) would make this so much better. 
3. Ability to pick the location would be a plus. 

Overall a more customizable workout would enhance this experience a lot."
659,Laurie,"May 18, 2022 at 10:50 PM",1,Not able to access,"I started with the trial membership, but now all I get is a screen that asks me to subscribe, but won’t actually let me subscribe because it gives me a big “server error” message. I’ve even tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it just doesn’t work 🤷🏻‍♀️"
660,Fascinating Earthbound Objects,Jun 19 at 3:20 AM,1,I'll join the chorus of voices here,And echo the same sentiment. Way too much $$.
661,Matt,"Mar 3, 2022 at 6:12 AM",5,Needs more music.,"So I love the Supernatural app so far. However, I wish you would give users the ability to create their own playlists and workouts based on the songs that are available. I understand the music has to be choreographed to the workouts/targets and because of that you can only release so many at a time. However, I don’t see why you can’t give us the ability to compose a list of our favorite songs on the app and create our own workout with them. Also, Supernatural needs more movie themes with songs from famous composers like John Williams and Hans Zimmer. My last issue is your 70s music collection. Where are The Bee Gees?? You can’t have a 70s music collection without them. Would love to see some hits like Stayin’ Alive and Night Fever. Other than that I still love the app. Keep up the good work!"
662,Jeff,"May 11, 2022 at 11:21 PM",5,Great for Beginner or Advanced,I am a long distance runner (90 miles/wk) and have fallen in love with the flow and boxing workouts as a way to focus on my core and upper body and I’ve been blown away at their ability to push me aerobically
663,octobetatest,Jun 7 at 2:38 AM,1,Not for the PRICE...,it looks nice and all but there's way too many other fitness apps on the market to be paying this much for VR.... fxue that!
664,Zack,"May 20, 2022 at 2:42 AM",3,It's ok...,"There are other options that have better workouts in my opinion. I like that have real music, but the workouts with the music I want to listen to are too limited. Last but not least... when I installed the app and first used it, I did not have to sign up for a subscription it was optional you just don't get everything, now it's mandatory and is more expensive than a gym membership... remember a gym has a facility and equipment and they are still cheaper."
665,WhiteManBad,"May 16, 2022 at 3:44 PM",3,Need to change this!!!,"Some people can't stand all the positivity during workouts. I like to be beaten down not patronized. Add an option to turn the instructor's voice all the way down. Or try hiring ppl that aren't so cringe. 
All in all I like the idea of the app but went thru 2 headsets from I assume sweat damage. 
Plus the fkn lens always fogs up cuz my house stays at 67 degrees. This cld be solved easily but the fkn needs making meta try their best not to sweat so they wldnt know."
666,Primates,"Apr 29, 2022 at 1:45 AM",1,Have to agree to subscribe to play,"I was hoping to give this a try. Yes, there's a 14 day free trial, but you have to agree at that time for autobilling at the end of the trial. I do not like to do things that rope you in that way, and though it says subscription available, and in game purchase available, it does not warn that subscription purchase is mandatory to use for any duration. Really bummed."
667,Steve Griggs,"Apr 21, 2022 at 6:49 PM",2,"Pretty nice, but…","So I have been snatching up every workout app on the platform. This is definitely one of the best on oculus. The problem is the subscription fee. I’m no cheapskate either!  It’s kinda hard to cough up 18$ a month. It’s a good workout but it’s not really “fun”. If they cut it in half then I wouldn’t mind it nearly as much. Or they could do like all the others and just make it a one time fee to buy. I would give up to as much as 50$ for the app. As it stands, I trialed it and canceled it solely on the cost alone."
668,Roar,"May 29, 2022 at 9:48 AM",2,The price is ridiculous,I didn’t play it but 180 a year is insane I mean in two years that’s how much I paid for my headset in the first place I can’t keep doing that every two years especially when there’s similar games like beat saber that are a fraction of the cost
669,Dominic,"May 14, 2022 at 6:34 PM",1,Invalid charge,I canceled my subscription and that shows on the app but I’m still being charged and can not find a way out of this. I’m very disappointed and frustrated because I canceled during the trial period. Buyer beware!
670,jho511,"Apr 23, 2022 at 7:23 AM",5,Life changing,Being a healthcare professional who has worked through the pandemic I have neglected myself for years. Burnout was setting in hard this year and I needed an outlet. I saw an ad for Supernatural online and it looked interesting. I immediately bought a VR set and signed up. This app has been amazing for my mental and physical health. I look forward to it everyday. It really makes exercise fun and it takes me away from the daily stress I feel. The online community is also very inspiring. I highly recommend SN!
671,kiki62,Jun 2 at 11:02 AM,1,Charged me for a whole year!!,I thought I was paying monthly and would try it for a month. They charged me for a WHOLE YEAR!  I can’t get a hold of support to fix it!!!
672,MamaDrama,"Mar 9, 2022 at 7:40 PM",5,Only thanks for this app,"My mother died from pancreatic cancer on Christmas Eve, I use this app to get rid of all my anger and sadness. Boxing at the hardest level with the angriest or most powerful songs allows me to let out my aggression towards this terrible disease. When I’m sad I use the confidence/power songs to workout and cry. This app has saved me from my thoughts."
673,Kingdaddy,"Apr 6, 2022 at 1:35 AM",5,Absolutely the BEST Workout App Ever!,"I hate going to a gym, just not motivated to do it. This is 180 degrees the opposite.  I’m extremely motivated by it, and can’t say enough good things about it!

And it couldn’t have come at a better time for me. I was diagnosed with AFIB, and I’m going to use this to beat it. Without a doubt."
674,Jenny,"Dec 18, 2021 at 10:56 AM",5,Amazing!,"So I did the free trial and absolutely fell in love with it. I have social anxiety and it’s hard to go out and workout and working out at home just seems so hard, but with this app it makes working out so much fun! I ended playing for 117 mins and burned over 1,000 calories, mind you I’m 5’8” and 180 pounds. I really like the boxing, but I wish there were more options available for that. I also like how they have separate levels of the boxing so I end up doing a couple at all different levels. The only thing that sucks is they are only 15 mins most for boxing I wish they were longer. All of the instructors are amazing and they explain everything very well. I’ve tried other workout apps, but none compare to this one it’s beyond incredible. I am going to stick with this for awhile to see the progress, but for now I’m loving it!"
675,Andrea Sutherlin,"Apr 20, 2022 at 8:52 PM",5,Worth it!,"We used to have a gym membership, but now we just use Supernatural for cardio and a weight set at home.  It's cheaper AND we actually exercise more often because it's fun and convenient!  Plus we compete every week on who can rack the most points!

We have been using this app for 3 months. During that time, my resting heart rate has dropped from the 80's to the 60's.  

Suggestions:
1. We would love some faith based music and reflections in the meditations.
2. We would like the option to build our own workout playlists.
3. Coaches Dwana and Mark are our FAVORITES.  ❤"
676,Fiorella625,Jun 11 at 4:44 PM,1,Failed trial,Did research on what would be a great workout. Signed up and now it’s something went wrong and can’t used it. It looks great and fun but a little disappointed.

678,Ben,"May 14, 2022 at 5:44 AM",1,beat saber is better,It sort of sucks I could not cancel the subscription and have no idea how and you could get the same thing with no subscription called beat saber which is THE SAME EXAT THING.
679,Yeswanth,"Apr 20, 2022 at 1:33 AM",5,Where Technology meets Sweat,"A great example of what when different worlds are brought together in synchronized model to create Magic

Technology ( VR) + Nature (environment) + Music + Coaching + workout + community 🔥🔥 

Yes it’s premium and they know that !!

they make sure they live up to that standards or will lose all, and trust me they always push their boundaries.

If you want just one time go for less mills, more than what you pay for but for some reason I enjoy opening this app more !!!"
680,Rob,"May 4, 2022 at 7:21 AM",5,What a workout,All levels of exercise will get you moving. No matter the day I can find a workout with music that I want to listen to. It also gets me to discover music that I didn’t know I would like. Also muscles that I didn’t know I had!
681,EB,"May 2, 2022 at 8:31 PM",1,No Refunds,"T&C say if you cancel your subscription, no partial refunds. Not worth the year pass. Content is limited and gets repetitive. They will take your money or keep charging you. Customer service is unhelpful in this regard as well. Just play beat saber instead."
682,LJ,"May 15, 2022 at 8:46 AM",3,Great workout but annoying talks,"I used the free trial. The settings/sceneries are beautiful and the workouts are great but I wish there was a way to mute the trainers. They are supposed to encourage you but they talk way too much (some sound so fake and disingenuous, it’s really annoying—a complete turn-off). I wish there was a music only mode (without them talking)."
683,DJ,"Apr 24, 2022 at 4:54 AM",5,Love it!,I absolutely love the workouts on Supernatural.  They're so much fun I forget it's actually exercise and by the time I finish I've worked up quite a sweat.  I've never thought I would enjoy a boxing workout but those are now my favorites.  And the views are just incredible
684,Dani,"Jan 24, 2022 at 9:17 PM",5,Fantastic!,"So I got my Oculus Quest 2 because I had seen the videos about the workouts and especially Supernatural. I've had it for 2 months now and did try Supernatural for the demo when I first got it I then got busy with the whole month of December and holidays. This month, I realized I had purchased the membership last month to it and realized I was burning money by not using it. 

I started using it and let me tell you, I am loving it! I made the mistake of trying a more intesive boxing workout the first time and for 3 days, I could barely walk. Ugh, my mistake. It also made me realize how out of shape I was. I am 5'3"" and weigh 180. When my body started to feel better, I started again with a low intensity flow workout. I loved it!! I felt so good after. 

I have since done 3 days in a row because I am excited to workout. I just finished a 23 minute workout and want to do another one. It's a lot of fun and the music is awesome!! The coaches are all great and motivating. 

I finally found something that I won't get bored with and can enjoy doing. So worth it!"
685,Talia,"Apr 17, 2022 at 1:37 AM",5,Amazing workout!,"This is 100% worth the money. Compared to a gym membership (it’s about half or a third of what I was paying for a gym pre-pandemic) it’s cheaper and I use it waaaay more often since I don’t have to get ready and leave the house, it’s way more enjoyable than a gym, and I just generally don’t vibe with gyms. I was worried as my fitness improved (I cycle once or twice a week too) the workouts would get too easy but so far they’ve been a good level. I was also surprised how effectively something like this could target certain muscle groups the workouts were aimed at. I know some people complain about the coach talking throughout the songs but I think it’s really helps with maintaining good form plus you can lower their volume. The songs are excellent and there’s something for everyone. Seriously I usually hate working out just for the sake of working out, especially indoors but this is really fun and can be adjusted to pretty much any fitness level. You could also add some wrist or ankle weights if you really wanted to be in pain. The locations are also amazing and really well suited to each workout/ song. I’m sweating after each workout and am a pretty fit 20 year old. Also low impact enough for my 61 year old mom who’s had a shoulder injury to do comfortably! Highly recommend. Only things that bother me slightly are sometimes the headset can be uncomfy if wearing for a long workout with lots of movement and will require re-adjusting (though that’s more due to oculus than this app but the high movement and sweating adds to possible discomfort- not a huge deal though). Also would be great if you could filter by which body part the workout targets! Or even search for specific workout titles, would make choosing a workout way more effective!"
686,Nope,"Mar 25, 2022 at 2:51 PM",1,"5 stars if lose the annoying ""Coaches""","I bought the Occulus because of recommendations about Supernatural specifically. 
While the graphics, music and environments are top tier, the entire experience is nullified by the so-called Coaches that cannot be deactivated nor muted. (You can turn down their volume, but still loudly hear their asinine comments.)
I suppose their canned, generic, non-applicable ""motivational"" banter might be inspiring to the weak-minded, but I'm likely uninstalling unless Supernatural starts listens to the many of us with this complaint."
687,Duste1,"May 16, 2022 at 1:02 PM",1,Don't do it,I refuse to pay 19.99 a month for a game where I can't tell the trainers to shut up ! Seriously  it's like commercials playing over your favorite song.
688,SunnyDaze,"Apr 15, 2022 at 9:09 PM",5,So much fun!,"I LOVE this workout!  I use this almost every day for 45 to 60 minutes.
Lots of full body activity, tons of different workouts, so you don't have to do the exact same thing every day. I rotate between both boxing and flow, but think I may get a little more whole body with flow.
I love the coaches, and the backgrounds are amazing. A few times, I've missed my targets at first because I was looking at the scenery. I'm learning to wait for the end of the song for that!
Best of all, NO pitch balck workouts. I tried a couple other apps, to add variety to this, but they were in complete blackness. My brain didn't like that at all. I am the person who really appreciates the different countries and all the daylight workouts.

What  I would like to see here is a way to set up  multiple workouts in a way that I could pregroup them and come back at other times and just click on a set. Right now, all I can see is making a workout a favorite. I often end up spending too much time searching for the workout I want to do instead of exercising.

An option to skip the cool down between multiple workouts would be nice too, but that's just me.

I'm 62 and have no problems doing this workout at all. I loved it so much, I subscribed for the whole year at once."
689,Tania,"Feb 20, 2022 at 8:25 PM",5,What is this sorcery?,I never in my life thought I would actually have fun working out. Supernatural has changed the game for me! I started on Jan 13th 2022 and haven't missed a day. I look forward to getting off work every day just so I can work out on Supernatural. In 6 weeks I've lost over 25 lbs. All the weight I put on since the pandemic started. In 6 weeks! Can't wait to see where I'll be in 6 months! Totally worth the monthly fee. I spend way more than that each month on streaming apps that have me sitting on the couch snacking. This is by far the best investment I've ever made for myself. Thank you Supernatural!!!
690,RizDaRula,"May 15, 2022 at 3:36 AM",5,Amazing!!!,I did not expect to fall this in love with Supernatural. To me it is a must have! Exorcise has never been so fun and easy to blow an hour of cardio out.

693,FatRabidSquirrel,"Apr 17, 2022 at 10:40 PM",1,"If I can't fully mute the trainer, bye","There is no option to completely mute the trainer on these workouts. If I'm working out to emo music, I don't need some over the top, bubbly creature yapping and being cringe about it. Legitimately made me not want to play this at all. I'll find something that lets me actually get into it without being jabbered at the whole time."
694,Pips,"May 6, 2022 at 5:46 AM",2,Too expensive and buggy,"I like the selection of music, and I like the workouts themselves. I think the developer should review the subscription model. $19 a month is far more than most gym memberships. I downloaded the free demo which showed up on the Oculus mobile app but not in the Supernatural app. Customer support was not much help. I can’t find instructions on how to pair my phone or heartbeat tracker. In the end it’s just too much trouble and too expensive for my taste."

I never agreed to paying this amount and nor would I ever pay that amount for a workout app, that is insane!  I request that the money is returned right away.  Just a note that over the years I may have used this app 10 times.  I was under the understanding that I was using a trial.  I never agreed to this charge unless Supernatural is not being clear on the charges.  I have spoken with my bank and they are opening a fraud investigation.  Again if this was some honest mistake than please return the money right away."
705,Rider,"Apr 7, 2022 at 7:53 PM",3,"Enjoyable, but is it worth $19?","Currently on the free trial and contemplating if I should drop the $19 a month for another month. Been enjoying it, but there are a couple issues that could make it better if they fixed it.

1. Not being able to fully mute the trainers, sure I get it the trainer is all part of the program and they are there to hype us up, but at times they are annoying and just want to workout without someone talking in the middle of the song.

2. Forced playlist. There are some good songs throughout the program, but there also some songs I am not feeling but am forced to play through to complete the specific workout playlist. I get it supposed to be a workout routine but an option to just play a specific song and make your playlist from those specific songs.

There are a good amount of songs in this, but once you filter it out by why I am really using Supernatural, which is the high intensity boxing workout, it trims it down to about three pages, in which I have already done about half throughout my trial so far.

Sure there are light and medium intensity, but those feel really slow for me and not worth doing as I am here for the rush. I could see it being worth it for a month and then I will probably move on to the next workout game. 

Not a bad app, but could use a price cut for it to be worth past a month of subscription."
706,Angel,"Apr 20, 2022 at 4:07 AM",1,WAY Overpriced,"I really tried to love this. I really did. And I absolutely WOULD if it weren't so overpriced. $19 a month for what I already have in Beat Saber, Tripp and FitXR Boxing, which I purchased before they switched to subscription, so I still have access for no extra fee per month. After this month, when I stop paying this huge monthly fee, I'm not going to have access to this app. So it will have been like throwing money away. Stop the subscriptions, devs. Come out with DLC's if you want and let us choose what to pay for. At least that way we'll still have access to your stuff if we no longer want to throw money at you."

I do wish we could download workouts for those of us who have to use out mobile hotspots for internet, but I'll make it work for now."
712,PiperLady,"Apr 28, 2022 at 9:25 AM",4,From sedentary to addicted,"I’m in my 7-day free trial. I really enjoy the game. I’ll probably register for a few months to keep using it. It’s really gotten me to move, literally 7 days in a row. Wow. I never would have thought. My body is sore from waving my arms all over and squatting. 

I’m giving it 4 stars because I wish I could select a workout based on a specific song in it. For example, if I like Don’t Stop Me Now, from Queen, it could give me all the workouts that have that tune in it. Right now, I can only search by genre, time, intensity. I’ve been looking for the “search by tune” option and can’t find it. I looked inside a ton of workouts to find a few tunes I liked. It was tedious. 

I like that I can skip the intros and cooldowns  and lower the trainer commentaries’ volume. I found those options out while pushing a bunch of buttons. 

Overall, it’s really good. I have to stop myself from doing all the workouts at once or else I’d be going on for hours."
713,77losSantos,"Apr 29, 2022 at 1:00 AM",2,Price point too High,IMO the price point is too. high $19.00  a month is too much for this especially if you don't have time to use it as much. Its pretty cool but still a waist of money. Also Ive been trying to cancel the subscription but they don't make it easy. When I go to subscriptions it says there are no active subscriptions.  and I know that's not true as I am being charged.
714,Kelly,"Apr 27, 2022 at 9:00 PM",5,"Great variety, super fun",I use Supernatural during my work day to get up and move.  The music is fantastic and the time flies.  You can definitely get your heart rate up in a twenty-minute session.  I highly recommend!

Billed once by Occulus and a 2nd time by Supernatural.  Supernatural keeps telling me it is an Occulus issue and they only see one charge.  Occulus support says their charge is for the subscription and Supernatural is charging just for their phone app.  So far neither party has resolved the issue.  Im still out money. I had previously highly recommended the app to friends but with the horrible support I can no longer recommend yo anyone."

There are tutorials, which is so importan. because of my health issues i have minimal knowledge of how to box, flow, etc... the tutorials go step by step showing the targets, what they mean, how best to do it, etc...The instructors are real people, have personality and each being their own unique twist to it (check out tutu tuesday for my favorite!) the scenery is awesome, each time you're somewhere new, i've seen only a few repeats in 2-3 weeks and it changes with each track not each class. The scenery are real places, they tell you where and sometimes a fact or two, and they are all beautiful. This all said, i wanted to branch out since im enjoying working out so did a free trial of FitXr to see about supplementing my supernatural subscription...i will hesitate before doing that again and want to express how GRATEFUL i am that supernatural takes into consideration peoples ability, health, aesthetics, and more! thank you! i realize now i could still be completely unaware of the joy of exercising if i had not tried supernatural first because i wouldn't have continued if it had been the other i tried first! Also, with subscription, supernatural sent a sweat resistant band for the vr! i love this app/subscription and will say even as a low income single parent it is worth every penny!"
722,Wiley,"Apr 26, 2022 at 10:08 PM",2,Great workout but....,"I REALLY enjoyed this workout app...when it worked... which was rarely. The workouts didn't load most of the time. I don't have the fastest internet but haven't had this problem with any other game/ app. I'd get to the menu, then choose my workout then nothing. It would time out. I brought my Quest to my work to see if faster internet would solve the problem. But then it wouldn't even load the menu. 

I talked to support 3 times and they just kept telling me to reset my router or uninstall and reinstall, or check my wifi speed. Even though I told them it wasn't an internet problem, all my other apps work fine. 

I loved the product but I can't pay $20 a month for an app that doesn't load. I've canceled subscription and I'm going to get a different fitness app."

724,AndieWags,"Apr 3, 2022 at 4:50 AM",5,Love this app,"I wasn’t going to keep this after the trial because it’s pretty pricy, but after 30 days I was hooked. It’s a great workout, I love the scenery, & the coaches are great too. I didn’t think I’d like the coaches at first, it felt distracting but now I find that they keep me focusing on form & sometimes even make me laugh, but I can understand people wanting the option to mute them. I’ve seen a lot of people compare this with beat saber, which I can understand. It’s similar & don’t get me wrong, I love that game but the higher up you get in the levels the less you can move because you just don’t have time to swing your arms like you do in this game. However, Supernatural has definitely helped me move up in Beat Saber, now the hard level seems slow lol. 

Bottom line is, yeah it’s expensive, but it’s cheaper & more convenient than a gym membership (especially if you have more than one person in your house playing), and it’s a lot more fun. I would like to see some other music though, like maybe Shipping Up To Boston, some classic rock, or some more classical music. The meditations are nice but I have a meditation app that I use more often, & stretching is difficult with a headset on. Also, it would be great if the community was on the app rather than Facebook, it seems like it was kind of set up for community interaction but falls short in that area. Other than that, great game!"

730,StadlerCrew,"Jan 16, 2022 at 12:49 AM",5,Where has this been all my life?,"I was skeptical, so I understand if you have hesitations. I was interested in Supernatural, but quickly dismissed it when I learned it was subscription based. Why would I pay a monthly fee to ""move"" when I could do that in Beat Saber, etc. Don't get me wrong... I love Beat Saber, but Supernatural is in a league of its own. I decided to try the free trial and all it took was one tutorial workout and I was SOLD. I seriously can't get enough of it. I have never enjoyed exercising so much in my life! It's a full-body workout- arms, upper body, back, abs, legs- it hits it all. And cardio- you will be panting and sweating like crazy... all while having fun. 

As someone who is in their late 40's and slightly overweight, I was a bit intimidated at the thought of personal trainers, etc. Don't let yourself think that too. The trainers who do these videos/workouts are amazing and so encouraging. You will appreciate things as simple as them reminding you to breathe in the middle of the workout, and they really keep you going and motivated when you're losing steam. Did I mention the music?? All the music you love is in it, and you can choose workouts based on type (boxing, flow, meditation, or stretch), trainer, intensity, or music. So, you can find a playlist you love and get moving. Oh... and the scenery- you get to workout all over the world.

Honestly, I was a skeptic and now I'm all in with it. The Facebook community is amazing, helpful, and so encouraging.

So, if you're hesitant because it's a subscription, or because you feel intimidated by the thought of it- don't be. It is worth every penny and it will be one of the best investments you make for your health and well-being!"

The boxing is by far my favorite and I can happily say I work out every day and push myself farther and farther.

735,Jerle,"Feb 12, 2022 at 6:34 AM",1,To much for to little,"While I will say you do get a good workout there are to many limitations to justify the price.

You can not choose your own songs nor create a playlist to exercise to.  And maybe you just want to exercise to that one song that is stuck in your had; nope you have to sit through a whole playlist till you get to it with no option to skip.  

And the biggest problem is you can not mute the trainer.  Yea you can lower the volume but not mute them.  You hit a good song after suffering through a playlist and someone is talking your ear off."
736,Scott Swanson,"Mar 28, 2022 at 11:14 PM",5,Life Changing!!!,"When you do these workouts you literally teleport into another world. You exit your current reality and enter a new one. A world of positivity, motivation and fun. An hour workout in the Supernatural world feels like 15 minutes. After doing a 12 minute low intensity boxing workout, a 27 medium intensity flow workout and another 15 minute low intensity boxing workout my Apple Watch had me at 744 calories burned. My legs, hips, abs and arms feel the burn but in a good way. I am NOWHERE near in good shape and I can complete these workouts and feel good about myself. Unlike BeatSabre you can make mistakes and it won’t end your workout. Instead the trainer motivates you, you take a deep breathe and refocus. This is about moving, not accuracy. Best of all my wife loves it so we have a friendly rivalry on points, days worked out etc. When I’m at the gym I don’t like to do group classes but with Supernatural I get the same type of full body workout you might get in a hiit class all by myself. Please trust me - the subscription fee is WELL WORTH IT. You can’t put a amount on your health and this will transform your health."

No seriously though. I absolutely love this. I'm on day 40 straight of working out with supernatural and my flabby mom (3 boys in 5 years) belly is almost flat now. I literally didn't even realize I was really working out until I noticed the difference in my body. AMAZING

I thoroughly enjoy my time on Supernatural. The scenery is AMAZING!!!! Coach Doc (my absolute favorite trainer) keeps me motivated to do my best inside and outside the VR world. My quality of life is much better because of Supernatural and my Oura ring reflects that! Before I started, my sleep average was in the mid 60s. It was 91 last night and I’m only on day six.

744,Elizabeth Thiel,"Mar 26, 2022 at 7:42 AM",5,Workouts you can love!,"I love Beat Saber. I love Tonal. I also love Supernatural on Oculus. I have to thank my husband for trying it out before me. 

So many more songs and movement than Beat Saber. No failing, just keep moving. My face seems to always pour sweat before the first song is finished. 

The coaches are warm, fun, encouraging, and loaded with tips on form. Sure, it’s only bodyweight squats and lunges, but you’ll feel it!
(Note: I have not done more than a few workouts yet, all of them flow. I’m aware there’s boxing, stretching and meditation available, too, which is awesome!)

I look forward to these workouts. I’m worn out after each workout. I love how I feel when I’m done with each workout. 

Oh, and the low, medium, and high intensity? Ha!  I accidentally tried a medium intensity a couple days ago with the Encanto Flow - because who doesn’t want to listen to Encanto and enjoy their workout at the same time? Whew! Just - I need to new sure and try all the low intensity workouts before returning to Encanto! I wasn’t ready for that!

Feedback: it would be nice to have a LITTLE bit of friendly competition with your friends and family and doing the workouts together on the oculus. I don’t know how that would work or look like, but I’d love to be a guinea pig for that."
745,PistolAnnie,"Mar 25, 2022 at 7:06 PM",5,Thousands Can't Be Wrong.....,"I wanted to find a workout app on my Quest but was initially put off by the subscription price and avoided the SN app although I had it downloaded on my Quest. Then all I saw online was “Supernatural This, Supernatural That”. Which got my curiosity pricked. So then someone in a FB group I belong to had a 30 day Free Trial Guest Pass going spare and so I thought, “Well let’s see what all the fuss is about”.  Man, I’m so glad I did! From the very first day, I was hooked and I knew there was no going back. I did the ‘Flow & Box Getting Started’ workouts and I was in! I absolutely loved everything about it. How the coaches were, not too over the top, but enough to keep you motivated throughout the workout. The actual “games” you’re playing are fun with great music to boot! With different intensity levels for everyone. Plus the stunning environments your immersed in while working out, are just breathtaking! I’ve seen in many reviews for SN where people have said “I’ll cancel a gym membership for this”. Well I already have. I had no motivation to go to the gym, but I can’t wait to get my Quest on and get into this app. It’s everything the gym isn’t for me. It’s got me moving and motivated to become a better me, in all aspects of my well being. Now I can finally say     “I am Supernatural”."

749,Jenn Grover,"Feb 13, 2022 at 9:56 PM",4,"Addictive, but room for improvement","The fun elementa makes this workout/game addictive, but there are a few things they could do to build upon the momentum and keep people engaged.

What is great?
1. Graphics and game design engaging, done at the highest level

2. Choreography- almost all are really good. Some are just phenomenal 

3. New WOD every day - producing content that frequently and keeping it fresh is hard. Supernatural does a great job

4. Points, streaks, leaderboard. There if they motivate you but coaches don't constanlty point out the leaderboard, like cycle coaches do

5. HR monitor integration - Pairing with my Androud devices seemed to improve with 2/22 updates

What could be better‽
1. Music selections - always room for improvement. The current selections are pretty good, but adding occasional plalists from less mainstream geners will help keep people engaged.

2. More social integration. Tag people in workouts, synchronous workouts with classes or friends (big tech lift), would be ideal to find a way for people of different fitness level to compete. Right now, very difficult for people of lesser fitness levels to compete with people who are more fit. It's a demotivator for the less fit.

3.  The ability to que workouts (stack them) from both the device and the app.

4.  All the really fun workouts seem to be medium. Through the people working up from low a bone.

5. We all travel sometimes. Create a couple of workouts that can be downloaded for offline use. You could get around music licsencing by hiring a composer or negotiating with independent musicians."

I tried it once and was hooked. I have exercised most of my life (I am 50) and hated every single minute and couldnt wait for the workout to be over. But with supernatural, I find myself doing more than planned…” just one more session”. 

I love the realistic pretty scenery and how many different scenes there are. The music has so many choices from 60s, 80s retro, dance, rock,and more. And there are so many workouts to choose from I haven't done the same one twice yet. Flow is my favourite, it really gets my heart rate up and is so much fun. I twist, stretch, squat, lunge and often dance to the music at the same time! 

I do intersperse “regular” workouts like full cardio kickboxing, or weight training on other days but what really opened my eyes to how much I enjoyed this was the other day I said to myself “if i do this weight training, I can REWARD myself with the Supernatural flow”. “REWARD myself”…. with exercise!!!?! 

Anyway I totally recommend this. I am working out now almost every day and way more than I have ever done in my whole life."

You can not put a price on how easy this app is to get a better you. I love the boxing and everyday they add new sets! There is plenty of music diversity and it’s only going to get better! The coaches are great and the details of setting you up help a lot! You configure it to your body. You learn the ways to hit, the do’s and don’ts of how to move and hit. So as a novice it made it easier to do. The thing is there is more than boxing. They have the flow workouts using wands, meditation, and  stretching. I am eager to try the meditation too. This is really the only thing I do with my oculus. Support is great too. I was double charged because of an email error. I messaged support at 9pm on a weeknight.

I love how you need to focus on the class to get the highest % possible.

I’m looking forward to more boxing classes with a hard level.

All the cool classes are too easy and/or short.

However, I'm giving a one star because they tried to charge me today AFTER I cancelled the free trial. Even on the app, it says my membership has been cancelled yet they tried TWICE to charge me. Hopefully it doesn't happen again, it really makes zero sense.

UPDATE: After a few hours, I received an email from Supernatural support stating that they have been unable to process my payment and to update my payment information. IT HAS BEEN CANCELLED FOR DAYS NOW.

UPDATE 2: After responding to support, they told me that I set my account to cancel in the year 2023. How is that even possible? I did no such thing... but anyways, it's fully cancelled now. How ridiculous!!!!"

They give you 24 hours before your final free trial day to get out of it but then make it impossible to do so. I had to pull out all my money from my account to keep them from taking my money. Only do the free trial if you don't mind paying the monthly subscription until they feel like giving people access to the unsubscribe link. I honestly feel like going to the gym is better because at least you can stop paying the gym the moment you decide it's not for you."

While I enjoyed the app, I did not intend to continue with a subscription. However, after more than an hour of trying to cancel the free trial without success, I gave up. However, as soon as I was charged for the first month’s subscription - magically a “Cancel Subscription” button became available for use. While I would have recommended this app to others, I think their shady business practice of a forced first month of membership made me frustrated enough to write this review. SO BEWARE - a free trial is actually a forced first month of subscription. Would not recommend."
781,cheeseypoofz,"Apr 5, 2022 at 4:37 AM",5,This is what VR work outs are all about!,"Love the game. Love the intensity. I only use the boxing right now but my form and speed have gotten so much better from the training.

I am 34 and feel better than I did when I was in college!"
782,Jen,"Feb 28, 2022 at 12:58 AM",5,Amazing!,"I've been playing almost daily for 5 weeks. I've spent about 2,000 minutes playing and have 115k points. I'm 32. It took about 10 hrs of play time before I could go high intensity for flow, medium for boxing. I LOVE the long pros only Flow workouts. Omg they give me life!!! ""Gimme Moreeee!!!""

I REALLY wish I could turn off the coaches when I'm really trying to sweat. Sometimes I like their ""presence"", but sometimes introverted & independent me wants to be alone in my head and in charge of my workout. I feel like I've put in enough hours and don't *need* the coach constantly. Plus, my workouts change a little daily. Sometimes I squat only instead of lunge because my knee feels sore. Sometimes I'm jumping around smacking those high balloons. Idk - I just make the workout ""mine"", listen to my body, and get in my thoughts. For those reasons, it would be nice to politely ask the coach to get out of my ear. Respectfully! They helped me a TON in the beginning. Seriously. They helped me understand how to follow trails, strike harder, check my form, give encouragement etc. But now, I kinda want to be the one in charge. (To be fair, I love the reminders to tighten my abs, and don't hold my breath, and that Coach Leanne believes in me... 💕)

Maybe after I've played the same flow 5 times, I have the option to turn off the coach? They do say some awesome stuff -- teaching me about my muscle groups, tips on how to successfully get through hard songs, suggesting ways to increase the intensity of your workout. (Like adding squats between leg lifts. Omg!) But I don't need to hear it EACH time I play the same flow. (I definitely replay my favorites many times.) Ya know? Would that be a fair request? 💕💕💕

I love the guided meditations though, very thoughtful moments. Would be cool to have a Supernatural guided/companion journal (with cute stickers!) so I could track my workouts/fitness goals/etc. 

I would like an option to ""free play"". Selecting my own playlist with various flow/boxing songs, and intensities. Maybe I could add a stretch/mediation at the end of my playlist? That would be fantastic - to build my own workout routines and just push ""start"". (Independent me would love that ability.)

Anyway!!! Amazing ""game"". I've absolutely loved this insanely fun addition to my workouts! 💕"
783,TonyChacin,"Mar 14, 2022 at 3:37 AM",5,Way better than expected!!,"My expectations were high considering the monthly subscription cost, but it definitely went above what I expected! If you are like me that doesn't have much time to drive to a gym or doesn't so well with YouTube videos or apps, then look no further. After only a week I'm seeing results! It's as intense as you make it, plenty of options for workouts and coaches, and the music make it soooo much fun. It doesn't feel like a workout. For someone like me to go from hardly workout out once a week to now looking forward every single day for a 30-45 min workout session with Supernatural its crazy good! Definitely worth the money so far.

My only suggestions for the dev team are:

- it would be nice if we could pick the trainer, the workout Playlist and then select the difficulty we want that particular Playlist.

- it would also be great if we had the option to pick the songs we want, the option of flow vs boxing and difficulty. Without coach if needed. This would allow the user to play the songs they want, at the intensity they want and have the option of going through it alone."
784,Liz,"Mar 14, 2022 at 9:06 AM",5,Finally a workout I can look forward to!,"Before Supernatural, I tried time and time again to stick to a workout routine, but it never took. The closest I came to was cardio kickboxing which I enjoyed, but it was a class and I had social anxiety and also hated following a schedule. I considered Fight Camp but it was way too expensive and also took up a huge chunk of space. I find treadmills (and running in general) to be the most boring thing ever and I hate the stitch in my side feel.

After I got my VR headset, I realized quickly it was great for fitness, and that's when I found Supernatural. I was hesitant about it because the subscription is pricey, but I decided to give it a shot. I had so much fun and was amazed that workouts can actually be FUN and also not cause any social anxiety. I enjoy both the Flow and Boxing workouts, though I like Boxing more and wish there was more of them or that the sessions lasted longer. But Boxing is still new-ish and I know in time they will add more content.

I log on Supernatural every night before a planned workout and check the content and bookmark workouts that I want to do the next day. It's really exciting to see new workouts every day! The coaches are great, they have different personalities and I enjoy them all. I really like how much music there is too, and the choreography is really great. That's the difference between shadow boxing while listening to my own music, and subscribing to a program like this. You constantly get great music with great choreography!

And lastly, one of my favorite things about Supernatural can only be achieved in VR, and that is the amazing settings. Who wouldn't want to work out on the moon, or on a glacier?"

786,AdaArtist,"Jan 2, 2022 at 1:03 AM",5,"Finally, A Workout That’s Fun","For my entire adult life, I’ve known that consistent exercise is important for good physical and mental health. Yet, I have never, until now, been able to motivate myself to stay with a workout routine for longer than a month.

It’s been 3 months now, and I am consistently working out 20 minutes or more every day with Supernatural. I even look forward to it. Supernatural combines a great selection of music with fun movements and a fun game of swiping at or punching objects flying in your direction with excellent fitness coaches and spectacular virtual reality locations around the world. The combination is exhilarating and motivates me to work harder than I ever have.

Before starting Supernatural I was feeling quite discouraged with the way my upper arms were looking more flabby than ever and my whole core was looking thicker and not toned at all. I’ve noticed my arms and core have slimmed down considerably. 

I tried the workout with guest trainer Tiffany Hadish today and loved it. Of course I did, have loved all of your coaches for both Flow and Boxing workouts. 

Thanks for giving me a way to workout that I actually look forward to! I highly recommend this, it’s totally worth it!"

790,HN,"Mar 13, 2022 at 6:49 AM",5,So much fun to work out!!!,"I bought an Oculus specifically to try Supernatural. I love the app. Totally worth it for me.

Background: I’m a 40yo female. In good shape and work out daily. 

I like to mix in Supernatural with my other workouts to mix it up. So I will usually do treadmill one day, Peloton bike one day, and Supernatural another day. I typically do the hardest level for Flow (swordfighting style) and Boxing workouts. 

I think I get a better cardio workout on my bike and treadmill, but Supernatural is much more fun and I want to do it longer. My heart rate is typically 130bpm to 170bpm on a high level workout. I love that Supernatural is a full body workout.

My kids (8yo and 5yo) also love the app. Their friends also use it a lot. They love the Disney song workouts and the classical music ones, such as The Nutcracker. My mom (71yo) tried it and also really enjoyed it. She does low-impact workouts and thought it was a really good workout for her. 

PROS: Super easy to use. It’s usually the app that I show people first on Oculus because it’s so stunning and easy to get started. Beautiful scenery. Great mix of songs - I particularly love the classical and movie soundtrack ones. Nice to have a mix of boxing and flow. Super easy to get a great workout at home. Can bring it with you and get a great workout while traveling. Connects to my Apple Watch and Apple Health for tracking heart rate and workouts. I can easily work out for 60+ min with Supernatural because it’s so fun. Requires you to use your brain while working out.

CONS: You need a decent amount of clear space with all the arm-swinging. Boxing requires a little less space. People get annoyed with the subscription fee, but the monthly fee is less than one spin class at a local spin place, so I’m fine with it. I wish it had harder levels and some more full body elements - perhaps some more jumping elements would be good. I get 99.9% scores on the hardest levels, so I would like something more challenging. I’m sometimes disappointed when a class has a great playlist, but the class is a really easy class so I don’t take it because it’s not a good use of my workout time. You can’t work out around little kids or a dog - would be really easy to injure them if they got too close while you’re working out. I can do my Peloton bike while my 2yo watches TV nearby, but I can’t do this while she’s awake and I’m watching her. Wish you could fast-forward or rewind a workout to get to a specific song or replay a specific song. Wish you could use the joystick button to scroll through classes. Wish you could do the meditation classes in a dark room without tracking so I could do in bed before going to sleep with the lights off (if my husband is already sleeping).

Overall, it’s a fantastic app. Very clean and professional. Really fun workouts with new content added all the time. A much better workout than Beat Saber for me. Somewhat comparable to Audio Trip or Les Mills Bodycombat in terms of my heart rate and feeling sore the next day. 

100% recommend. Supernatural proves that there is a very bright future for VR fitness. I now want ALL of my workouts to be in VR somehow!!"

For what it’s worth, I’m a middle-aged woman and this is still the best thing ever. I found that I love boxing and I’m even going to boxing classes now. Go figure.

Trust me, you will expand your base of older users like myself who bought my vr headset in the first place because of my mobility challenges. I would rave about your app then."
794,BDaddy,"Feb 14, 2022 at 6:10 AM",2,Good but overpriced and coaches annoying,"Let me start off with the good - the graphics are pretty good (but not great), and the game mechanics are pretty well thought out. The game play is very similar to Beat Saber but with the addition of boxing blocks and it has more dodge and duck moves, which is good for leg workouts. Now for the bad - it has coaches that constantly talk over the workouts, maybe some folks like that, but to me it is more annoying than anything when they are talking over the music. I didn't check the options, maybe there was a way to turn them off? Music variety is pretty decent, again, similar to Beat Saber. So overall it could be a good purchase, if the game was actually a ""purchase"", however this game is actually a very expensive ""subscription"" service. If the game got rid of the coaches and had a price model like Beat Saber, it would be a good buy, and I would have bought after the trial, but the game is in no way worth hundreds of dollars a year in subscription fees- you can get a much better workout at the gym for a similar cost."

I’ve worked out 7 of the last 9 days. I’m feeling the burn and seeing results. Only downfall is that my brain wants to keep going when my body is fatigued. But I find myself at work looking forward to coming home and doing a workout. 

People have complained about  some routines being very short. You know what? You can fire up another workout quickly and skip the cool down on one and the warm up on the other with the press of a button. 

People have also complained about not being able to search songs. Guess what? So what. You can filter music types. I don’t love some of the hip hop music but the playlists aren’t long and the work outs are still awesome. So I do those anyway. 

Way better than beat saber because the music is awesome and you’re working your whole body! Get this app and drop your gym membership.

801,Sammy,"Mar 9, 2022 at 1:12 AM",5,Worth the subscription fee,"With a plethora of unique fitness games out there the $18.99 usd monthly, I needed to justify a subscription I’d have never considered typically.
My wife and I are in our mid-40s and have some physical limitations due to age.  I should also say I have a serious shoulder/arm injury so that has factored heavily.

Get this app and subscribe if you:

👍🏻 Like well known music with different genres.

👍🏻 Want to exercise regularly from low to high impact.

👍🏻 Like trainers with unique personality from motivational to funny

The only con, which isn’t a consideration for us, is lack of strong competitive challenges.  However, the app has good tracking of stats and is fun and motivational!  This is my top used VR app ❤️"
802,David HK,"Apr 6, 2022 at 10:32 AM",4,Top Notch Fitness Program,"Really good music selection, great instructors, fantastic background. Very addictive workouts. I am leaving out one star until they can add some type of practice mode then it would be perfect. Like when I do the Boxing workouts, I sometimes run into tricky combos that I would like to rewind and loop them until I get it  or really fast flurries that I would like to slow down and eventually speed up. As it stands now, you can't even choose a particular track unless you redo the whole workout which is not very practical in that sense. But other than that, it's fantastic. Keep up the great work!

I would REALLY like to emphasize the need for some sort of practice mode where you have the option of slowing down the workouts and returning to certain parts. I find that with the movement based apps, when you can slow the session to a slower pace  you are able to further perfect your technique and perform significantly better at normal speed."

There are no gyms close to me and I know that realistically I’m not going to drive 30-45 minutes to go work out, and who can now with these gas prices anyways??

807,Richard,"Mar 29, 2022 at 4:05 AM",4,Good workout but needs better options,"I liked supernatural when I started playing a lot and I still like it but not enough to cover $20 a month subscription. It is very enjoyable but I found some of the limitations annoying. For example you can’t just pick a song that you enjoy to work out to and play it. You have to use their pre-canned playlists. You can’t even search for a playlist that includes a specific song you like. And when you review the playlists, there’s no way to tell if you’ve played it before. Although when it’s done it tells you compared to a previous time. You rate the playlists so it would be nice when you started to play if it told you what you rated it.  You can share a profile with multiple people, but they all need to use the same headset.  That’s kind of defeats the purpose because the last thing my wife wants to do is share my sweaty headset.  The trainers are good and add a nice backdrop to the workout but they get repetitive over time."
808,Jaycee,"Apr 4, 2022 at 10:45 AM",3,Great game but too expensive monthly..,"I mean I love it, absolutely love it. That being said..

I would love if y’all partnered with a streaming  platform where I could stream and box as the same time-that would be freaking cool and a good motivator. Be lazy and watch Netflix but also keeps you moving. I love the destination and it’s part of the whole experience but it would be a cool option. I just love this.

In fact, my wife despises how kids are obsessed with them.  I watched YT videos on the product and decided to buy a VR and Supernatural.  Holy smokes, we love it!!!  We are both in our 50’s and we are excited to do it every morning. We are competing against each other and having fun! We are entering week #2 and we are already losing weight.   I can’t wait for more!"

Then all of a sudden Supernatural came into my life, I'm down 8 pds since December, and I'm now working out everyday. The coaches are what keep me motivated, with their uplifting spirits that the bring to each of these workouts. God Bless you Supernatural, you got me off my butt and believing in myself again.

819,Jeffwise,"Feb 28, 2022 at 10:04 AM",2,My review after 7 day free trial,"Update:

Billing- 

I have canceled the free trial. A day later I got billed. Make sure to cancel by the 5th day to be safe and keep in mind to check your bank account. I had the credit card company cancel it. 

Free Offer- 

They have advertised a free silicone cover, but they never sent it out. They will send you an email saying its on the way but tracking number will remain in the print label stage for weeks. I do not expect to get it at all. If you do receive it then Im happy to know some may get it.

Pricing/Content- 

for 19 a month you are only paying for Intellectual property fees for
the songs and the development of the environments and trainer content. There is alot of bloat content that users dont care about (mainly the music).


Keep in mind that World of Warcraft is 15 a month for each subscription, and their  development costs and content updates are substantially more.  


In conclusion, I would say wait till the price goes down to 9.00 - 12.00 a month. Then it will be worth it. This type of app could NEVER be worth more than 15 a month. The competition coming out will make pricing right.


Gameplay/Content-

Supernatural really shines here. It was the first app that really does it right and makes working out in VR fun and retentive. Search on youtube to see more on the mechanics and game modes in action.  Pricing is what holds it back and now we are getting more alternatives apps on quest now that perform almost as good, if not better in some aspects, that cost much less.

There is no Co-Op..

You think you would be able to join your friend that also has a subscription and workout together. I will re-evaluate this review and app again later though and check up on it."

822,Brady Scher,"Mar 3, 2022 at 1:36 AM",5,All my favorite things,"Literally combines all my favorite things.  Fitness, Gaming, and kick-a$$ music…and I can’t get enough!!!  Used to be that resistance/weight training was the favorite part of my workout and then I’d reluctantly slog my way through some cardio (or skip the cardio all together).  But now!…now I’m allll about that boxing cardio action🤜💥.

Now like most things, when it comes to fitness, you get out of it what you put into it.  So If you came to Supernatural for the boxing workouts (like I did), I would highly recommend getting savvy on good and proper shadow-boxing technique for max results.  If you’re new to pugilism (boxing😉) take the time to do the tutorials on the Supernatural app (YouTube has good tutorials as well) and stay focused on your technique when your blasting those targets.

Price for the subscription shouldn’t stop you either.  Way cheaper than a gym membership and who wouldn’t happily put down the subscription cost for nearly guaranteed results.  Lean bod, tighter everything.  Go get it.

It says you can cancel in supernatural companion app or at the oculus account. I couldn’t cancel in oculus as there is no cancel button under subscription, so I downloaded the supernatural app which says: “ You are currently on a Monthly Membership that is managed by Oculus. To make changes, please go to the Oculus Mobile App.” 

So I’m bouncing around not being able to cancel. Suuuuper annoying!!!!

I wear contacts so the oculus makes my eyes a bit dry while staring at the targets. I love the challenge of the different levels and countries with the music that’s upbeat and just right plus the Supernatural crew is amazing!  Thank you ☀️
827,Xesculous,"Apr 15, 2022 at 3:40 AM",3,Deceptive,"I can't speak for the actual quality of the game as I was unable to access it without first buying their subscription. It may say it's free in the store, but as far as I can tell it's unplayable without paying their internal fees. 

Edit: As the devs have replied below, I forgot to mention their free trial. However if I remember correctly it mentions that after the limited period it would then turn into a normal subscription. While I appreciate the offer, and professionalism of the reply below, it is in my opinion never worth the effort of dealing with any sort of trial/demo that continues into a regular subscription immediately afterwards."
828,Dan,"Jan 5, 2022 at 4:53 AM",5,Amazing workout program!,"I was considering giving you guys a 4 but the recently added modifiers update killed my only big hang up with the program. As someone with a smaller vr room I just don't have the space to be swinging around my whole room. It truly is an awesome add. The classic style of super natural was pretty unplayable for me with my small room but with the addition of boxing changed that. 

 I love the boxing way more because honestly I feel so awkward doing the lunges and boxing just feels way more natural to me. The fact that only one work out had me using more than a 180 degrees of movement compared to classic supernatural where you use probably the whole 360 degrees of movement. Now with the modifiers what was almost completely unplayable for me is now fixed!

The only gripe I have with them is that modifiers are kinda hidden behind settings, because if I didn't know to look for the new modifiers I more than likely would of never noticed them. So maybe adding an extra panel to the UI or before you start the work out it asks if you want to enable any modifiers or reminds you that you still have them on. For boxing I never want the facing forwarded modifier but I sometimes forget to turn it off if I'm doing the flow workout before. Other than that my only other big ask is for more modifiers to make the workouts your own. Maybe on flow I could toggle only squats, a 180° mode, or maybe I want the boxing work out to be started in South paw. 

Also I love Doc's meditation so much. I don't know how else to put it but I simply love them and I look forward to checking when the next one comes out. I just wish that when he's done talking I could just hang out there a bit longer and just soak in what was said rather than just getting booted back to the main menu. 

Now that you guys are owned by meta I'd absolutely love some sort of boxing gloves and or  some kinda of controller that feels more ergonomic to use. This is coming from someone who is a beatsaber junky and I use like a claw grip on my controller when playing expert plus Saber maps. The issue doesn't really come up as much when doing flow maps because they are why less hard core than beatsaber. Regardless I would really love something that feels more natural to swing around and doesn't kinda slip out of my hand like the default quest controllers do when I play flow maps. Also I feel like you guys should recommend everyone to use some sort of yoga mat because it was a big game changer for me. Due to my habit of slowly walking forward while working out the supernatural mat I consider a must but I'm sure you could make due with a regular yoga mat too. 

I also will say I would love some more holiday themed environments during the holidays. Where was the new years fireworks back grounds and Christmas lights and maybe some Boston for Thanksgiving. Sucks that boxing only got its holiday session so late but I just love my holidays so much that I would really LOVE for you guys to double down on HOLIDAYS. themes like for ST. Patty's days coming up, Chinese New Year, and hey maybe even pride month would be dope too. 

Regardless the music selection is truly amazing, I would of never imagined that having the custom coaches talking during the workouts would be something that I wouldn't just mute but they are so great and I've really grown to love them regardless of how many cheesey jokes they say during my ska jamout sessions, and just over all I'm very happy for the content roll outs being very frequent!

 I just want more ska punk boxing workouts and maybe hit up the bad times record's guys to get some new ska punk in this game and other underground punk labels. 


Tldr I love supernatural ❤️❤️❤️"

834,Danie,"Mar 1, 2022 at 10:24 AM",5,Completely hooked.,"I visited a friend for her birthday weekend. After the party people left she wanted to show me her new game that was her day to day workout. She was so excited about it and said she couldn't wait to play everyday. Seeing as how it was a workout program, I thought, yeah right. She did a set and then put the flow training on for me to try. 
After the flow training I was hooked. I wanted to do another workout. Then another and another but I felt bad for not spending time with her and only wanting to be on her game. So we quit for the night but I did some more in the morning before I had to leave. Once I returned home, I gathered up the money to buy myself the Oculus and as soon as it arrived I immediately downloaded ""Supernatural"". It's been two days and my muscles are so sore that I can hardly move but I can't stop playing. I'm sure that tomorrow's going to be even more difficult to move but let's face it, it's been a while since my last workout and I'm sure my muscles will get less sore over time. Plus, this doesn't even feel like working out. It's so much fun.  Now I'm the one who can't wait to workout everyday."
835,Nick,"Mar 27, 2022 at 2:32 AM",2,Beat Saber does the same thing for less,"No hate to those who want or need a guided workout program with frequent new content, but this isn’t for me. This app let’s you download it for free but doesn’t tell you you have to pay an $18 a month subscription to access even the basics. For my purposes, Beat Saber is the better investment. A good-sized library for a one time purchase with some paid add-on as needed. 

For folks who want new and guided workouts, this program may work great. No hate whatsoever. If you just want to have a good time and get some sweat going without paying monthly for a guided workout environment, then Beat Saber may be better for you."

You dance, squat, box and just flow to good music and they have music for everyone’s taste.  I gave 4 stars because trying to go between different workouts slows your heart rate down. There should be a way to skip the coach if you are not new."
839,Matthew,"Mar 22, 2022 at 3:37 AM",3,"Fun and addictive, but flawed","I enjoy the boxing and flow because they work up a sweat on the high-intensity modes. I just wish there wasn't such a large difficulty gap between Low and Med, and a narrow difficulty gap between Med and Hard. It's like Low = 1, Med = 5, Hard = 6. This doesn't cause an issue for me in the boxing because Hard isn't hard.

However, Hard and Med are so close to each other in Flow, they're the same difficulty. I would like to see a better difficulty gap. On a positive, I like that it doesn't fail you like Beat Saber.

The trainers were helpful at first, but I noticed they're just trying to hard to be liked by you. The dialogue is the main issue. Leanne really wants us to know she used to frequent Hot Topic. Speaking of, grandson and FOB are not pop-punk. The genre labeling needs work."
840,Anny,"Mar 21, 2022 at 7:01 PM",2,"Cool settings, but extremely irritating","I really wanted to like this app because the concept is really cool, especially the virtual reality landscapes. However, it is impossible to mute the coaches who are extraordinarily annoying to me (but I'm sure a lot of people like them, that's just my personal opinion). I hate most of the curated playlists and it's not possible at this time to curate your own playlist. So yeah, if you are someone with very specific music taste who doesn't want to be forced to listen to a slew of songs you don't like just to get to the one song you do like, and doesn't like corny cliches being incessantly shouted at you during a workout, I wouldn't recommend it. Switching to PowerBeats VR to see if that gives me a bit more freedom in terms of music selection and a way to shut those irritating coaches up."

Unfortunately only after I did it again, I got a message sayin that they were not available here STILL. 
That is not a fair play from the company to allow you to subscribe if they wont work at all!!! I want a refund on the payment done! And I am reporting this!

If I only knew about this sooner I would have bought an Oculus sooner and this app. I'm old and fat and haven't found a fun way to exercise until now. I tried an advanced one, yeah, that didn't go well, but I sure was sweating, the intermediate workout, again, sweating but still too difficult. Now I am starting at beginner ones.

851,Pablo,"Mar 18, 2022 at 8:05 AM",3,"Excited at first, bored and limited now","I was absolutely in love with the app, but after 1 month I have completed 53 sessions and it’s starting to be boring. For me, music is the core of exercising. I really cannot do the workouts if I don’t like the music. And unfortunately there’s too much rock, metal, indie music workouts. I totally understand people liking those, but it’s not for me. The library of dance electronic, house, commercial and reggeaton is really limited, which are the styles that really pump me up and get me going!

I understand that it’s hard to satisfy everyone and I do see the constant updates with new cool exercises every day. However they make it really hard to search and find your best fit. Examples:

1) At the end of a workout you can give a 1-5 ranking but there’s no way later on to search for those that you ranked as 5! I don’t mind repeating an exercise but I do wanna know which ones I had liked most! Also, even if you go clicking one by one, your 1-5 ranking doesn’t appear anywhere, so honestly it seems useless.

2) In the Explore option you can filter by music type but the genres are all mixed up and also wrong. Many times I had to stop a workout because it said it was Pop or Electronic and really it wasn’t. It’d be cool too to search for artists. And the best feature ever would be if Supernatural could link to your Spotify and suggest workouts that match your liked songs :)

I’ll probably give it some more days, but I do see myself unsubscribing in the very near future. It’s just way too expensive for an app without the basic features I listed above."
852,6xmommy,"Mar 17, 2022 at 10:08 AM",4,Love SuperNatural not the $$,"Let me say I ABSOLUTELY LOVE SUPERNATURAL ❤️. However, the price by the year is ridiculous. It’s $179 yearly not like the other games that’s a 1 time purchase. I emailed them to see if there was a better pricing structure and they were like NO! So unfortunately I had to cancel but you can get a similar dance workout feel with beat saber and it’s a one time life purchase.  Supernatural does incorporate new songs and workout routines but it’s basically the batons on the boxing. I like the real people for workouts and the real songs. It would be nice if you  could incorporate your own music in there 🤔🤔🤔. Anyway the pricing is what will keep most people out of supernatural which is sad because it’s a fun workout.

I’m going to try other fitness workouts that are cheaper and see what’s doable."

855,Derek,"Oct 28, 2021 at 8:42 PM",5,From nope to hope,"I gained 35 pounds since the pandemic began.  Even before that, I hated working out.  Going to the gym, home treadmills and bikes?  Nope.  I never looked forward to working out.  I put it off as long as I could - till AFTER work.  I didn't want to work out, and I wanted to WANT to work out.  

Enter SuperNatural.  

Now, I want to work out.  To the point where I'm getting up early in the morning (I work from home, sedentary) and will put in somewhere at least between 20 and 30 minutes every day.  Sometimes, when I have the time available (weekends or days off from work), I'll put in up to an hour and a half.  I WANT to do better and be better and I WANT to work out.   At this point, I've been working out daily for 113 days (July 14) and no plans to quit any time soon.  I've added healthier eating about a month ago as well, nearly eliminating sodas altogether.  How?  There's a community on social media of others like me.  The encouragement from the group members, including the coaches (who participate as well), and those I follow in the companion app is extremely supportive - reminds me I'm not alone.  

I tried the (at the time) 30 day trial.  After 3 weeks, my wife encouraged me to pay for the year.  Bonus, she has a logon on my account and can use it too - she's excited about the boxing modules.  

As a therapist, I know that social support and outreach is important to reach goals.  Since July, I've lost 21 lbs.  Heck, since September 27, I've lost 13.  13lbs in a month!  But even more important than that is I'm stronger, I have more energy, I have a better mood - I have hope.  I see what's possible.  And I don't have to go back!"

I do however wish that this app was not on subscription basis and that you could actually buy it as a game and buy add-ons. However for me it is worth it to have a subscription I do like all the new daily updates and daily new workouts. I also love that they offer meditation. I wish they would add a little bit more Miranda Lambert Carrie Underwood style but I do love my rap music. Coach Rainier is wonderful and funny to work out with, he makes me snail and laugh almost every work out. Coach  Doc is very encouraging and has very fun work outs with the boxing while still pushing you to be your best. All the coaches are wonderful and I really like Coach Leanne is amazing and inspiring. I love most of the music choices and that there are different intensity levels for the needs of us the people!!

862,Georgeisadog,"Jan 25, 2022 at 7:22 PM",5,Great trial and customer service,I only used this app once. I got a great workout and had fun. The next day my legs were legitimately sore. I then forgot about the app until I was charged for the end of the free trial. I canceled my membership online and requested a refund. I was issued a refund no questions asked within 5 minutes. Maybe I’ll consider subscribing in the future.
863,Jade,"Feb 21, 2022 at 9:02 AM",5,Perfect just needs more boxing videos.,Me and my boyfriend love this app so much.  We both have a oculus and play together everyday  burning thousands of calories  and it's so fun and addicting. We both have our own subscription because we really love this app and want to  support this app.  And keep the new content and updates coming. Our only request is to please address boxing. Theres so much content for flow. Adore keeps coming but we really love to see more for boxing. Please add more videos for boxing. Thanks
864,EmWay,"Feb 21, 2022 at 3:56 AM",5,You won’t regret this purchase.,"Listen……I put on a Covid 15 and then some. I’ve been in a horrible slump. Eating like crap, not working out. I signed up for this app when I saw Tiffany Haddish and I’m not kidding, I’ve worked out for probably close to 3 hours today and I want to keep going. It is soooooo much fun! I am extremely out of shape so I was scared but I’m so glad I did it. They make it so fun and challenging. 

If working out is something you dread and you can’t find the motivation, like me, then you will want this app. Spend the $20/month and you won’t regret it. I can’t wait to try their meditations tonight before bed. 

I truly feel like this will be a game changer for me and for my life. I’ve NEVER EVER looked forward to working out and now I hate that I have to share my oculus with my son because it’s taking time away from me using this app. Ha! Prepare to sweat, friends. I promise you, if I can do this, so can you!"
865,Wingards,"Feb 20, 2022 at 11:41 PM",5,Worth Every Penny!,"I got the free trial just to see, not expecting to actually pay for it. But here I am loving it! I mean LOVING it!! Figure I'll pay by the month for now to make sure I'm going to stick with it but I expect to. After only a week I can already see a difference in my hips. After a workout I am beat, but it feels so good and I always look forward to the next one. The headset is a bit uncomfortable to me and you'll probably want the silicone cover as you'll be dripping sweat, but it's so worth it."
866,GUS,"Mar 16, 2022 at 9:10 AM",3,"Not bad, but could be great.","I was interested in this app mainly for the ""flow"" exercises where you use a bat to hit targets much like Beat Saber.  I've become bored with the small song catalog on Beat Saber, so I really enjoy the variety of music offered in Supernatural.  I also really love the beautiful environments that Supernatural offers.

Unfortunately, Supernatural doesn't offer anything in the way of customization.  You are stuck with the pre-made workouts and whatever songs and locations that are in those workouts.  You are stuck with the pre-made workout difficulty levels, as well. For almost $20 per month, I expect a little bit more.  If I could choose my own selection of songs, the location, and the difficulty, I'd be a lot more interested in the membership.  As it is, I don't feel like I'm getting a whole lot more than what is offered in Beat Saber (which is a one-time purchase + song-pack add-ons available).

I think Supernatural has a good foundation and great concept, it just needs to be expanded upon a bit more before they can really justify a monthly membership fee.

Response to Developer: Thank you for responding.  I understand that it probably takes a lot of work to create the workouts.  However, you would make many of us happy by just allowing us to string together our own songs into a custom playlist with out the coaching.  If you forget about the coaching aspect, it should be an easy feature to create.  The courses do not interact with the backgrounds, so those should be interchangeable and selectable as well. For future songs, create courses for all difficulty levels (again, not that difficult) and that would add even more options for your customers.  Sorry to tell you how to run your company, but it's a pet peeve of mine when companies get in the way of their own success.  Good luck!"

I have a semi gym at home. I don't like going to gyms. I tried a boxing app, my arms get tired before I get to the fun part. But this app got me interested. The songs are amazing. Assistance is amazing. Customization for limitations is amazing, session backgrounds are amazing. I did one session of 5 songs and I'm drenched. I find it a bit expansive, with Canadian exchange rate, but I liked it so much, I'm gonna give it a go."
869,Kim Elliot,"Feb 19, 2022 at 3:06 AM",5,Never had so much fun working out,"Honestly some days are really tough for me to wanna get my butt up off the coach and work out.   This makes working out more fun than I have ever experienced in my entire life! I'm really grateful for this app. My only complaint is that there needs to be more high intensity boxing options.  Even some of the high intensity stuff feels slow, just need a little more sometimes, you know? 
But honestly worth it!  And  Those people saying this is a rip off of beat saber, that is absolutely not true. The music selection is way better here, and the boxing is much more challenging.
 Also would be great if they could incorporate some kind of ab workouts.  Sometimes I do abs while hitting the targets from the ground which is super fun and challenging."
870,Jeremy,"Mar 13, 2022 at 6:02 AM",3,Different but the same,"I like that there are blocks of time that you can work out too but the “intensity” levels for me lead to injury. It starts out nice with proper form but then just goes into like beat saber and any other game where It’s more about speed and wrist action. 

My suggestion would be get rid of intensity and add levels of duration and complexity. Such as more squat and lunges for flow then slips and stance changes for boxing along with time increases.

I do appreciate the trainers at the start but would like to mute them and then just pick pieces of the workout to go together as I please. In short, an option that allows me to pick which sections of workout I want with a muted trainer.

I will continue to use the app for workouts and find my own way to mute the chatter and even add my own playlist on the low “intensity” levels. They are the only ones that actually let me do proper form and I can add my own complexity to them. 

The breathing and stretching portions are awesome and I do those pre and post workout by using the awesome option to skip warmups and cools downs for the workouts. To sim it up, I ask that more options be provided when it comes to duration and complexity while removing intensity. Then adding the option to mute trainers and Frankenstein ones work out plan."
871,TheLlamaJockey,"Jan 4, 2022 at 6:47 AM",5,Good stuff,"At first I was thinking I would just play thrill of the fight and beat saber to get a similar workout experience without a monthly cost... But, I actually really like this. The flow mode is much more fitness oriented than beat saber, and the boxing on medium to high intensity is really exhausting. Plus, I like the trainers, and it does help to have them in your ear encouraging you. As a bonus, I like the self meditation just to be somewhere nice and relax after a session. This morning I did a pretty intense workout to Christmas music, laid on the floor with some mountain scenery, and relaxed afterwards... until my dog excitedly ran over and started licking me on the mouth- rudely interrupting my peaceful cool down. Oh well.  Can't blame supernatural for that I guess."
872,Eduardo,"Jan 1, 2022 at 4:59 PM",5,Flawless,"This app will have you working out in a fun and engaging way. I keep coming back after being a subscriber for several months now.

At first the subscription model bothered me, but I guess it's the price to pay for having musical hits in an app, fresh content, and new features. So, for now I'm onboard with it.

The ""coaches"" are great to motivate you during the workouts, don't like them? Mute them. But I do like them, my favorite is Raneir Pollard, he has some of the most clever warm-up and cooldown stretches I've done, plus he's really fun to hangout with during the workouts.

1) I would like to see backgrounds like Hawaii and Florida beach scenes that put you right on the beach with waves` especially being your graphics are better than most ...

2) It would be nice to have other full workouts like weights, marching in place, sit-ups and etc. Upper body is great, but it would be nice to have some lower body workouts as well other than squats leaning from side to side, like weight training or even line dancing that doesn't take you more then a step or two in either direction. ...

     It does seem a bit pricy and I will probably need to see a bit more in order to continue this after I get down to my desired weight, but for now I am loosing on and average` a pound a day.

883,CyberPilot,"Mar 8, 2022 at 3:29 AM",4,Love this app but has one limitation,"This is my and my wife's favorite Oculus app and favorite homework out program.  So much so that my wife and I have canceled our gym memberships.  The music is great.  The scenery is fabulous and love the coaches.  Plus it's also great to compete with other people you know or may not know on the program.

Here is the only problem that is a huge limiting factor for us...you can only use the program and family account on one VR headset.  I travel 50% of the time for work.  So each time my wife and I have to determine who should get to use the headset while I'm gone.  Kinda like kids fighting over the big cookie.  Please, please Supernatural allow this program to be used on different headsets so my wife and I don't have to share.  

Also, after someone does the workout the headset is so laden with sweat that it's kind of disgusting to share with the other person even though it is my wife."

887,kyle,"Jan 14, 2022 at 7:57 AM",4,Amazing... But preachy and political,"Pros: 
*Graphics are the absolute best in VR so far 5+ stars! This is the best feature hands down, the locations are breathtaking!  Even the CGI worlds they put you in are do much higher quality than any others so I have visited.  If this is the future of VR I am so excited!  
*Music is darn good, full of pop hits of every genre
*Exercises are full body and thorough, just like taking a body conditioning meets aerobic dance class like Zumba, only you don't leave your home and the membership is generally less than a gym membership.

Areas for improvement
*It would be great if we could skip songs we don't like or generate our own custom playlists with our choice of music. Suffering through songs I can't stand just to hear one I like is painful at times.
*Keep the political activism and patronizing or corny jokes out of the workouts.  This is not the platform to preach political or alternative lifestyle ideology any more than it is to spread a religion.  I came to work out, I do not expect a pride parade.  We live in a diverse planet, so to be truly inclusive, please avoid these topics.  Nearly half our planet (3.8 billion) are part of Abrahamic religions which do not celebrate sexual diversity and they don't want to be preached about celebrating pride or instructed to dance in a sexually suggestive manner, any more than secular folks want to be preached to about Jesus, Moses, or Muhammad's values.   Honoring differences in culture would greatly expand the appeal of this app.  If the pride workouts stay there should be workouts targeting various popular religions as well for balance.
*This may not be possible due to music licensing, but it would be great to mute the coach.  For some of us the jokes fall flat or get repetitive and the patronizing encouragement gets old if we repeat the same favorite workout.  If it is impossible to mute the voices, keep the coach commentary to only reminders on form and fitness or workout related.

With a few tweaks this app could truly be an app for everyone of all ages, cultures, abilities, fitness levels, musical tastes. It has so much potential and I am so excited for the future of VR fitness for all!"

I first started with the normal pop music workout but have migrated to the sweat symphony category. I am obsessed with it. All the musicals and symphony tracks!! I never thought I’d be feeling like ballerina while working out to Swan Lake. And now Disney Music (ready for more)!!!! My fiancé and I have been using this instead of going to the gym. I prefer the flow and he loves the boxing. I can not recommend this application enough for people who want to workout.

Even when I don’t want to get off the couch, I get up because I know I’m about to have fun, and feel that connection to my body (which is oddly addictive). Knowing that I’m doing right by my body, gives my brain the permission it needs to focus on other important things. I can’t say thank you enough to supernatural.

893,Sarah51878,"Feb 13, 2022 at 9:59 AM",5,Beat Saber won't get you close to this,"Update:  It's been more than a year and this games is still the best for fitness out there.  The developers have added so much content.  There is always new music and new scenery.  I didnt think that would matter to me at first, but now it's clear how helpful it is.  I've gotten burned out on tons of other fitness games, but this has really held my interest.  The subscription model is truly worth it for the constantly changing material.

 Original 2020 review: I like Beat Saber.  It's fun, I break a bit of a sweat, and I can get a little sore afterwards.  However, this game is actually designed to be a workout.  I can feel the difference in the muscles used and the amount I sweat.  So, hitting the balls is a little like slicing the blocks, but beyond that, the two don't really compare.  Beat Saber doesnt care how much power in a hit.  It doesnt force you to move your arms in a specific way, and it doesnt make you use your abs like this game.  Maybe Beat Saber will go there, but I think this game will stay in front.  I am pretty introverted and I have never wanted to find a trainer, but I really like the trainers in this app.  I've been bored with my workouts for years, but this along with a game I use for biking, has really brought my love of fitness back again!  The only complaint I have is that I wish there was more variety in the music.  I don't care about the licensed stuff so much.  One other thing. If you are looking for something to challenge your brain with puzzels, yes Beat Saber will be more difficult.  This game is not about beating levels, it's about getting fit."
894,Pengypoo,"Feb 13, 2022 at 10:27 AM",5,Definitely going to subscribe,"I'm 7 days into my 14-day free trial, and I'm definitely following through with a subscription. I thought I was getting a decent workout with Beat Saber, but this is a whole different beast. While beat saber is fun, a lot of the strikes make no sense and I feel like they're there to make you crazy. In Supernatural, the motions flow and actually force you to work different muscle groups. Even though I know I'm ""playing"" to basically a video track, the coach commentaries are actually really uplifting and helpful. They will tell you that if you miss one it's ok; it's more about form than accuracy. But if you're hungry for competition, you can add people and climb the leaderboards. You can also set goals for yourself in the app and get streaks for continuous days and weeks.

In addition to flow, which is the Best Saber type workout, they have stretching, meditation, and boxing.

The music choices are great, and there is even a website where you can request new songs to be added. Genres include pop, punk, rock, country, jazz, musicals, and even classical. Customer service is also super responsive to emails and suggestions."

The thing I enjoy most, is that I'm working out and it doesn't feel like it. When I set up everything, I setup my calories and movememt- how many calories I wanted to burn and how long I wanted to workout. I always exceed my goals when in Supernatural. 

And the location....stunning!

The coaches are amazing. It's the first workout platform I've experienced where it seems like the coaches are there with you. Sometime when I'm slacking in posture, Coach Mark will say, watch your form....and it feels like he's talking DIRECTLY to me because my form isn't as it should be. Can't forget to mention guest coach Tiffany Haddish....love it that she brought her cray cray personality with her. And, every coach is the same- there are there for us and I love it.

902,Mommadre,"Mar 9, 2022 at 9:27 AM",2,Leaving because of explicit song content,"To the Music Curation Team: 

I’ve been here for about 2 months, playing an hour+ a day almost 5 days a week. I LOVE the high intensity flows, and really enjoy the boxing. But I have reached the limits of what I’m willing to go through to find a workout that I don’t need to quit mid-workout because the song lyrics cross a line. I have learned to take a listen on Spotify, and to look up lyrics online, but then I am still reading content I would never choose to expose myself to. 

Pornography(images or words “whose purpose is to elicit sexual arousal”-Dictionary.com) is bad:

https://fightthenewdrug.org/

Swearing is rude:

https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-39082467

There are TONS of popular songs that are fun, high energy, and clean.  

Some solutions:

▪️Rate the workouts as explicit.
Or at least label them with some system so we know what to expect, then people can choose what they want to be exposed to, or not. Just check boxes if a song has 
🔲sex, 🔲swearing🔲drugs/alcohol🔲violence. 
▪️Let us create our own workouts by song.
▪️Lean much more heavily toward making workouts that aren’t explicit. I would love to see the majority of your songs be things no one would find offensive.  You could still have an “adult section” for those who wanted it. 

I know the label says, “Teen: Suggestive themes, Drug Reference, Language”, but, honestly, I didn’t even look at that because it’s a fitness app.  Worrying about offensive content didn’t even cross my mind. 

I never would have stepped into the app if I’d known what I was getting myself into. Then I guess I would never know what I’m missing either as I try to make due with Beat Saber and FitXR(NOT the same. I greatly prefer Supernatural. Minus the sex, substance abuse and swearing.)

All of that said, I plan to keep checking in to see if there is ever enough clean content to make the price worth it.  (I saw there was a ~20 min high intensity flow Sweat Symphony added today!) It is an extreeeeemly paired down app if you stick to the clean stuff, but if they added(a lot) more, I would love to reinstall it."
903,FlamingHalo,"Jan 19, 2022 at 8:49 PM",4,I honestly want to do this constantly,"I wanted to hate this.  I really did.  I read all of the reviews about how it's so much better than every other app out there and the subscription fee, etc, and I really wanted to say, ""Eh, it's not that great.""  But honestly, I love it.  It's not often that you start a workout that you find yourself thinking about all day long.  I want to do it as soon as I wake up, on my lunch break, I don't dread it every night.  It's just FUN!

Okay, so then why the 4 stars?  It could easily be 5 stars, there are just some small things that hold it back.  And I'm not talking subscription fee.  No one wants to pay, but if it's something that gets me off my booty to be excited about working out, it's worth the small fee.  It's no more than a monthly gym fee, and let's be honest, not only do I not have motivation to leave my house, but I don't have the confidence, either.  

Things I love: 
1.  I don't love the subscription fee, but the fee is reasonable for new daily content and contemporary songs.  
2.  Variety of songs and locations.  The visuals are stunning.  The songs are my favorite from across all genres/ages of my life.
3.  It. Is. FUN!!!

What could be better:
1.  The leaderboard is nice, but I would LOVE if this were a multiplayer app.  I have a friend that keeps me accountable (one of the top ways science tells you to stick with a routine!).  We can join a chat and talk during our workouts and try to time them to start together, but it would be great if you could workout with someone. 
2.  The stretch component really leaves a lot to be desired.  The stretches are short and primarily upper body focused.  Okay okay, I know, it's a boxing app, but there are days that every athlete needs a ""rest"" day.  I would LOVE to see a 20-30 minute full body stretch video.  Right now, I have to do these on other fitness apps/videos I have to really get the lower body and feel satisfied."
904,HoneyTwiddles,"Feb 10, 2022 at 6:17 PM",5,Best part of my day!,"I love this app! It’s visually immersive and beautiful. The music is varied and they’re always adding more by songs or artists. For the interface, I like their companion app more than the in game interface. The app feels more user friendly and is linked to Spotify (so you can listen to the playlist from the workout). I couldn’t recommend this app more."
905,Princessjenniekenn,"Feb 10, 2022 at 5:02 AM",5,The most amazing fun workout activity,"I am someone who gets a little bored with just walking / running on a treadmill or following (as much as I love it…Apple Fitness) but with Supernatural, I find myself working out for an hour and not thinking when is this over.  The coaches are freaking amazing and the music is awesome.  Work the money for sure!!!!"
906,K9Medic1341,"Feb 9, 2022 at 11:30 PM",5,Just starting out,"I just started using this app yesterday. I really like it so far that I used it again today. So far I have tried boxing which has made me sore and i thoroughly enjoy. It make me get a really good workout in and sweaty in less than 20 mins. After boxing today, I tried out the tutorial for flex. I’m sure once I get used to that one I’ll enjoy that just as much. I would say I would recommend supernatural to anybody that would like a mix of everything to workout."
907,Dee Thrasher,"Feb 16, 2022 at 5:47 AM",5,Only reason I wanted occulus,This workout don't disappoint I been wanting to get the occulus since I saw someone do a review on this and it don't disappoint I don't like traditional workouts I get bored this keeps me interested and even when I'm tired I want to keep going love it will tell everyone
908,Rick Koper,"Mar 3, 2022 at 6:25 PM",4,Amazing game. Costs too much,"I played this for two months and it would be a must-buy if not for the sub cost. Fantastic coaches and engaging fitness routines. This is a polished app but I can't justify the cost for a limited aerobic app. If it moved to a single price with optional add ons, I would definitely come back."
909,Candytroll,"Feb 8, 2022 at 11:47 PM",5,So... this is amazing,"I was truly into fitness for YEARS of my life. Like... it was my only hobby. Then I tried crossfit and immediately injured my back. I couldn't walk for quite some time and gained a bunch of weight because I could hardly move, even after physical therapy. I developed a sort of PTSD with all movements because I was so scared to re-injure my back and throughout the past 3 years I actually DID re injure my back multiple times due to exercises re-engaging it. 

ANYWAYS..... this is the FIRST workout program that I can do that has not affected my back at all. The trainers are SO ENGAGING that I am able to forget my fear and just do the workout! I'm actually excited again to workout. After being out of shape for so long I am SOOO sore and I love it! The trainers are the best Hype people and remind you of important steps like engaging your core and putting your weight in your heels for squats. I just love it. The Disney workout is just the best."
910,Nikki Lynn,"Mar 1, 2022 at 10:34 PM",4,Just a warning for people like me,"I bought the oculus mostly for fitness and to get me moving while doing something fun. I apparently didn't do my research well enough on this program because I didn't know I'd be expected to do workouts while standing way in the air, dummy me lol,  Unfortunately it causes me to lose my balance and makes it hard to workout without feeling woozy. I can handle being slightly elevated, but some of these have you standing pretty high above everything.  I wish there was a setting where you could still be in all the cool places on here  but actually be standing on the ground instead. Having said that, this program is pretty great if you can handle that aspect of it. The scenery is beautiful and the little bit of workouts I've tried seem like they would be very effective. I hate that I am so sensitive to these things because I know I would love this if I could just get past that one thing. Apparently I just suck lol."
911,Zinnaerris,"Mar 5, 2022 at 3:38 AM",5,Amazing!,Truly the most amazing fitness setup. I am excited every day to get logged in. The music is great and it's so much fun. The Facebook group community is really motivating as well.
912,ifman,"Jan 24, 2022 at 10:05 AM",5,Absolutely worth it,"I've only done the trial so far but will probably subscribe. Good variety of options, and actually good coaching that helps with form not just motivation. Great music selection and many levels of difficulty. This is always compared with the ""big"" music game, but I think they are very different and this is much more geared towards serious exercise. I would love it if they started offering individual songs to select... So you could kind of build your own workout instead of relying on what each trainer curates together. I like those as well, but once you do a few workouts it would be nice to just go do your own thing."

919,Chaunamac,"Jan 23, 2022 at 9:57 AM",1,Overpriced,"It is a fun virtual game, unfortunately you cannot choose the songs you prefer to listen to with the workouts you prefer.

Great idea just priced way more then it’s worth."
920,Dom,"Mar 1, 2022 at 3:59 PM",2,Keeps freezing & turning off,"I absolutely love this fitness app. The movement and songs really excites me. I use it in addition to going to the gym. My only thing is that every single time, I can only get to maybe the second song before my screen just goes black. No matter what, every time wiper fail and it’s only this app. It makes me so angry when I’m all pumped up and excited then I can’t finish it. It’s not like I can go back and skip the first 2 songs and finish it. It will black out on me anyways. I don’t understand and it’s a huge problem. To pay all this money and it isn’t even functional for me. Even did the latest update and still won’t work. Really disappointed."
921,Ha-root,"Jan 7, 2022 at 2:34 PM",5,Can these be added,"Love supernatural . Is there anyway these two options can be added . 
1. You can make it so there are no breaks between songs. Just flows right into the next without breaks . 

2. Some sort of mode so In boxing or flow you can change the speed of how fast everything is flying at you. Sometimes I want more of a challenge.

I only wish you could workout with a friend somehow.

I'd like if there were more options to filter workouts in the VR app, similar to how you can filter on the phone app. I'd also like if I could queue up workouts. That would enable me to decide on a workout before I go to bed, and then jump right into it in the morning."

I was scared of boxing at first but man, game changer. I was so sore for the first week, fantastic workout. Dont skip those meditations - they have been so helpful and calming. Now I crave those 5 min pep talks daily. Supernatural will change your life if you show up daily, best app on Quest and easily worth the 20 bucks a month to feel this great emotionally and mentally"
934,bek,"Feb 4, 2022 at 12:32 AM",5,"Affordable, fun alternative to a gym","Got my son an Oculus for Christmas and he kept encouraging me to try it out.

You have the option to choose from Flow, Boxing, Stretching, and Mediation. You can find tutorials in the app, on Youtube, or you can search/ask in the wonderful Facebook community. In settings, there is a way to calibrate for your height, squats, and lunges. There are also modifiers available. If you feel the set warm-up/cooldown isn't enough for you in Flow or Boxing, you can always do a stretch (or two) before/after."
935,Stephanie,"Feb 4, 2022 at 5:52 AM",5,Addicted,"I bought an oculus to mainly workout and I heard this was the best game to do just that. It doesn’t disappoint. Worth the monthly subscription. The workouts feel like games and I have been introduced to Meditation through this app as well, which was an added bonus I didn’t expect. 

I love how Supernatural transports you to amazing places that only one could hope to visit in a lifetime- while you get to listen to Nicki Minaj and feel like a bad a** on top of a mountain or in the middle of the ocean… as a child I always lived in a world of make-believe and I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to step foot in an actual make-believe world! I can’t wait to see what else I will explore with Oculus, and Supernatural was a great first step to getting me comfortable with my Oculus in the VR world."

940,Brian,"Feb 10, 2022 at 12:52 AM",3,A bit pricey,"[Pros]

Boxing workouts are good. Tracking is great vs fit XR’s boxing workouts, and the mechanics are good.

Coaches are good and their avatars look great compared to uncanny valley fit XR. For example, they cover ways to prevent potential elbow injury from hyper extension. It seems like they’re reactive too ie if you’re messing up they will offer guidance or support. 

Environments look great. The visuals look great overall, and they keep getting better with the new sci-fi environments.

Workouts are varied and long enough. 

They keep updating it with new workouts and features.

[Ok]

The music selection is a hit or miss. I didn’t realize how important it was until I played this game. Out of all the fitness apps, this has my least favorite selection.

Most of the workouts are still beat saber imitations. Why bother? Why not just play Beat Saber. The music is better and it’s more fun with Beat Saber. They’re only playable on high intensity which translates to Beat Saber’s “Hard” level which really means Normal.

UPDATE: Play the beat saber workouts on high intensity and try EDM tracks. It's pretty good then.

[Cons]

Too expensive even if you buy an annual membership. Fit XR is much more reasonable.

There’s no multiplayer like fit XR. It’s lonely. There’s no competition to push me forward. Even if the competing players were just previous recordings it would help out a lot.

Didn’t care much for meditation. If I wanted to meditate I would get an app that specializes in it or something like Brink or Real Fishing VR.

[Verdict]

It’s improved, but not enough and it’s still hard to justify the subscription price. There should be more workouts to choose from at this price point.

UPDATE: I can now justify paying for this because they keep updating it."
941,IAmActuallyADog,"Nov 29, 2021 at 8:42 PM",1,,"It is a cool app but they make it impossible to cancel a subscription after signing up for a free trial. Defeats the whole purpose of a free trial.

Update since I can't respond to your reply: I reached out to your support email before leaving this review. No response."
942,StandardNerd,"Mar 28, 2022 at 5:22 AM",3,I like it alright,"I enjoy the workouts but I have to say even with the music selections, there's too much hip hop music.  It all sounds the same after a while."
943,Frachel91,"Jan 18, 2022 at 7:07 AM",5,Couch Potato,"My husband signed up for the subscription before I had even tried it. I watched him do one and saw how much he was sweating and was super discouraged to try it, as I am a couch potato. However I am also very unhappy with my current health and body, currently at my heaviest weight after three children at 189 and 5’1”. I’ve never been excited to work out at all… until this app. It’s so much fun. I REALLY enjoy the boxing. And the best parts for me?: the coaches teach you very well, I don’t have to stare at myself in a mirror and see how awful I look in the middle of a workout, I don’t notice my sweating until im done, the music is amazing, the environments are amazing, I don’t have to find time and a babysitter to go and do a class a couple times a week, and im finally feeling encouraged and excited to do something. I’m only on day two, my thighs are sore, but im feeling great! I look forward to many more boxing classes to be added, please and thank you!"
944,Billy,"Feb 8, 2022 at 8:40 PM",3,True and honest opinion,"This is a great game. I love the song options they have and I really enjoy the fact that they include meditation and stretching. The reason why this isn’t 5 stars is for 2 reasons. 1: it is very similar to beat saber, and that game is only like a $20 one time payment. This isn’t that much of an issue obviously, because they added their own twist on it… but that just brings me to the second problem. The monthly payment, it’s just to much for what’s being offered. Now I’m sure if you’re older and well established this isn’t that bad, but for me who is young and in college monthly payments just aren’t really smart. So it upsets me that I have to cancel this membership because I really enjoy the game. Of course I know that the company that made supernatural probably needs the money to pay for all the songs they used etc.. so I understand it but I just think it’s way to expensive for what’s offered. Besides that, if money isn’t a problem for you then you will definitely enjoy this game and probably consider it to be a 5 star game."
945,Juanito,"Dec 3, 2021 at 1:33 AM",2,"HONEST REVIEW price, game, functions etc","Read it all trust me! First off yearly subscription is a whopping $179 (14 day free trial) or $20 monthly (7 day free trial). This is not a not a gym membership or replacement for those prices. I get some people can’t always go to a gym or don’t at all. So in supernatural you cannot choose specific muscle groups to workout. At most you squat and step side to side and depending on boxing or bats you’ll punch or swipe the targets and move your hips. Also occasionally you turn about 30 degrees left or right here and there during songs so that’s your full body workout as that say. 

The best thing it has going for it is graphics and surrounding view while you play. Another pro is the motivation to move more as it’s a fun game(will also list cons). There’s around 10 min and 20 min classes. Low, medium and high levels of intensity for boxing, the bat swiping game and a few minute classes on meditation and some stretching. So before anything if you’re getting this to lose weight be real with yourself, it can help and keep you active for a small part of the day. It’s fun and I like doing so but these 10-20 minute classes aren’t some hack, cheap, or fast way to get fit. You have to put in the same effort if not more to get results you want in game or not. Eating and shopping right, time planning, running/ jogging, sleeping right, balancing work and social life, lifting weights, stretching etc depending on your goals. 

BOXING pros: Intense and gets you sweating sweating! Mentions pivots, using your torso, how to step and slip etc. I look forward to using it and exercising as soon as I get home as it’s actually FUN
BOXING cons: Music lists. I get they say they have good songs and go through professional choreographer and attain licenses etc but everyone’s taste in music is subjective.. including the people who put them together for you. I’ve had lists where the songs were okay and just okay, with one song liked. Lists with complete trash songs from the genre I chose, or my favorite is songs you really like but the workouts is slow or trash compared to others songs workouts.. worst part is you have to play that playlist all the way through as it’s a whole class and cannot skip or customize the songs or target intensity for that song. Some tracking for targets I knew I hit will not register.

SWIPING bat game pros. One pro is with follow through and flow of the swipe game. Instead of chop down they want you to swipe all the way from the top to the bottom and follow through like swinging your arm back around and getting a good stretch in, Something you don’t get with beat saber. That’s about it same pros as boxing as it’s fun.

Cons: swiping game was wayyyy less intense compared to boxing. Barely broke a sweat compared amd doesn’t give you a workout like you want, at least for me. Same thing with Playlist selection and not being able to skip.

MEDITATION pros: one, and it was it gave me time to catch my breath as I did them after boxing.
MEDITATION cons: Not for me. Tell you how to “ground” yourself and let you sink into the ground, feel the gravity, yata yata etc. kind of hippy, rock licker stuff as I don’t need someone to tell me how to feel good or relaxed to feel good and relaxed and “be in the moment”

Final verdict. Definitely not worth the price. If your getting fit or wanting to. You’d get more use buying an adjustable ever-last punching bag and base, some good gloves for the price of nearly $200 they’re charging. If you pay monthly, pay monthly on FightCamp to get tracking devices, feedback and actual punching back that has the same personal trainer and more pros and tips it has in here with a community straight to your home. If you already have a bag like me get the free trial for fun, cancel and spend that money on on other fitness games especially that have MULTIPLAYER as the game doesn’t. Save money and get free lessons amd tips from pros on YouTube amd work that into your workouts amd punching bag amd finish the day off with a cool off walk with the family around the neighborhood. $200 every year for an okay game that has all the drawbacks, some not listed, and trainers can be annoying at times as you know they try to be happy, supportive and peppy for you is too much money. Don’t care if they have a big staff or pay professionals that’s their choice amd everyone has to get licenses to use other people’s music. Supernatural isn’t that special amd if the price was less than may or I’d think about it."
946,Care,"Feb 5, 2022 at 2:22 AM",5,Boxing is rad,Love love supernatural boxing and do one almost every day.

957,Whoeverx,"Jan 31, 2022 at 4:52 AM",5,Feels like a good upper body workout.,"I love to walk alot and jog a little so have always had the lower body workout covered. I do not like to go to gyms at all so Supernatural  might just be the perfect upper and maybe mid body workout for me to complete a healthy daily exercise. Atleast I'm hoping so and it works well for me since I spend alot of time in a motel room where I can work out right there. So far it has my interest and I have used it everyday for a month straight minus the 2 days I was traveling.
 There is a very similar game called Beat saber that seems alot like Supernatural. I feel the big difference is that Supernatural doesn't come off on me as a game and instead as an exercise program, plus power matters. I also like the bright scenery, it brightens my days in motels while exercising. Using real workout coaches that you can physically see to help you workout is key to set Supernatural apart from any other workout program I know of and helps set it apart from being a game in my opinion. 
 Now the big question is whether the monthly subscription cost is worth it. It probably is if you use the program as faithfully as I have been so far but only time will tell. 
Happy Supernatural workouts to any who tries!"
958,Chris,"Jan 30, 2022 at 4:00 PM",5,Excellent but needs abs and core workout,"Thé app and content is great and changes daily. After much debate, I took the plunge and got the best deal: the annual membership. The Facebook community is also very active and adds to the overall value. My upper and lower body are getting a great workout.

The only area for improvement I can think of is if Supernatural found a solution to whip your gut/abs and core into shape as well and doesn’t get much of workout no matter how hard you tightened them… Time tôt think outside the box and find a way to squeeze in an ab and core workout routine somehow!"
959,HarryHoudini555,"Feb 21, 2022 at 3:50 AM",3,Very good but could be much better,"It's a great concept and you can get lost in experience. I use wrist weights which makes this a pretty good workout. However, there should be an option to turn off the coaches. After a week of this you should decide if you need to have someone tell you to upper cut every six seconds. Some are outright annoying.  Second, the music choices are poor. An option to stream my music, say from my Amazon playlist, would make this so much better."
960,Kp,"Jan 6, 2022 at 8:10 AM",5,They Turned Working Out Into Funning Out,"Don't noodle on it one more second-this is worth every penny and then some. It doesn't matter how long you've been away from working out or even how hopelessly unmotivated you feel--Supernatural. Will. Change. That. Yes it will. Yes it will.  Know why? Because when a workout is a FUN OUT, you do it. The workouts? A blast. The MUSIC?! Bananas. SO fun. And even though I never imagined this would really matter to me-the settings are GORGEOUS, and that makes it even better.  It's honestly magical. 

I read the reviews that exclaimed these same things and bearishly thought ""ok I guess we'll see""...and then I chose the monthly option when I set up the free trial:-) I fully expected for this to turn into yet another workout thing that everyone else is hooked on that I pay for and never use. By the end of the second workout, I was hoping it wasn't too late to change it to a yearly membership. Hope you decide to go for it!"
961,Niki,"Feb 21, 2022 at 12:21 AM",2,Just OK,"This game is OK. I wouldn’t consent it a serious fitness game. You can definitely burn some calories, but the “trainers” are pointless and EXTREMELY annoying. I would much rather have the music then their pointless commentary. It’s not worth the high monthly fee. I have a peloton membership and this is about as expensive as that and the workouts are nowhere near that caliber. 

They should focus on the music and add more levels and I would play it, but not for this monthly fee. I’ll just continue to play beat saber."

I know and love the songs, at every level you’re challenged so there is a level for everyone. And now with the boxing!!… It’s even better!!! Use it in addition to your own workout or do more than one in VR, either way you will not be disappointed! You think it’s not going to be much of a workout until you realize how much of your body you’re using for movements.. it’s more than moving arms while standing… Just get it!!! Big thanks to the developers too!!!"
966,rockitar,"Jan 24, 2022 at 4:03 PM",2,Money hungry,"First of all this is a fun game and you do get a good workout in as far as playing a game goes.  The scenery is cool and the instructors are a nice touch. 

However, Since you pay $180 for a year membership you would think that if you and your family have their own headsets they could play on their own devices without having to switch the primary users account over to their headset so they can use app sharing, which by the way you can only do 6 times a month, and everyone could play at the same time if they want to since 3 additional accounts can use the membership. If this was an option this would be at least a 4 star review"
967,Blaakimusprime,"Dec 28, 2021 at 12:14 AM",3,5 star game 3 star music,"Love the concept and game. 5 stars. What I don't love is the music selection and not having the ability to turn off the coaches.  Who ever is picking the music is not open to all music genres and what more than just one race of people like.  For example not enough House Music, Afro House, Soca, Dancehall, AfroBeat. Their idea of House music is pop then the few house programs are political. I just want to exercise. I don't want to hear the coaches talk about their politics, or hints of sexual tones,  hence the reason we should have the ability to turn off the coaches if we like.  This is is overall why I give it 3 stars."

970,Weird Momma,"Feb 18, 2022 at 12:04 AM",4,Best of the bunch for a gamified workout,"I docked a star because I hate subscriptions. But I'm guessing the music is expensive to license. At this point I've tried Supernatural, FitXR, and the new Les Mills offering. Supernatural has the best music hands down. Les Mills Body Combat was effective but I didn't enjoy the format. I need to be distracted from the fact that I'm working out or I just don't want to. Supernatural is still game-like enough I can power through 20-30 minutes before I jump into Beat Saber or Pistol Whip. I'm not workout junkie and I'm only using these things to move more. It's working and I look forward to it every day. I do wish you had the option to make Supernatural feel more competitive. Some of us enjoy that. Beating scores can keep you motivated longer. I also wish I could turn off the coaches entirely. The overwhelming positivity grates on my Gen X soul. 
But, again, best music out all the games and still enough like a game that it's fun."

You know that little voice in your head that is constantly talking to you through those at home workouts? The one that tells you to keep pushing, to never quit? On the days that you can’t find that voice within yourself, your Supernatural coaches will find it for you. Theres no need to do it alone. Change your life with that extra cheerleader in your ear. Keeping you in form, motivating you, makes you laugh, and even cry with pride. Today is a good day to have a good day. Give it a try and thank me later."
975,Erin,"Jan 19, 2022 at 2:40 AM",3,I REALLY wanted to get into this...,"I've been using video games to work out since I bought some Dance Dance Revolution controllers and hooked them up to my PS 2 in the early 2000s. I have a really hard time getting myself to workout just for the sake of it. I need points! I need to beat my high score! I want to get into the flow and forget that I'm actually getting exercise!

The problem with Supernatural is that it never lets you forget that you're working out. From the responses to some of the other reviews it sounds like they don't have the rights to play the songs without people talking over them, so the whole song you're getting ""coached."" For the record, I'd 100% rather have music I don't know without people talking at me. 

The talking is the biggest problem for me, but I'd also love to be able to just pick one song and practice it to beat my last score. Custom playlists would be great as well.

I'm likely going to cancel my subscription,   but I'm going to keep an eye on updates, in case they can manage to make Supernatural into something that would be more fun for me. In the meantime, I'm going to go back to beat saber-ing and playing just dance on my switch."
976,Meghen,"Jan 26, 2022 at 10:25 PM",5,Better than anticipated,"I've been using Supernatural for a month and I'm addicted. I haven't lost weight, but I'm losing inches and have more energy. I don't normally work out, because I find many exercise options to be boring. But Supernatural is a lot of fun. The music selection is good. There are a variety of exercises, and they are constantly adding new ones. I had to take some time off because I got Covid, and I found myself missing the workouts. I like that I can workout alone but still receive encouragement from a coach. I also like that I can choose the intensity and time to fit my needs. Just know you can't currently add your own music or compile your own song list, but each workout is created with purpose, so have faith in the choreographers."
977,Tony,"Feb 17, 2022 at 5:34 AM",4,Real nice app and workout,"I tried the app with the free trial and really enjoyed the flow and box workout. Unfortunately, I got injured some times ago and it looks like I haven't healed enough. So, even if I enjoyed the workouts I was hurting afterwards, I had to cancel the subscription after trying it out. But I'll come back later for sure.
In the meantime, maybe that will give give to fix a little bug that I was experiencing. In the menu where I could search for a workout, the interface didn't always update correctly when I selected a filter tab, like workout intensity, music type,... Sometimes I had to switch tabs several times so it would display the right filter options. That explains the missing star 😉"
978,Jaclyn,"Jan 17, 2022 at 3:31 PM",4,Love this workout!,"I love this workout. I feel swamped multitasking school, work, and internship. I have zero motivation to do any exercise. I also developed arthritis in my big toe due to exercising injury, making it challenging to enjoy working out. 

However, the only thing I would love to see are subtitles. I’m Deaf; I would love to see subtitles included to help me with the mediation session. Can you please make that happen?!"
979,Mike,"Jan 16, 2022 at 8:34 PM",4,,"This is an entertaining workout that gets you sweating.  Real life instructors provide intros to the workouts with a warmup and cool down.  They can be annoying, I find Leanne to be the least annoying.  

Compared to the FitXR platform,  Supernatural does it better.  Especially now that they offer boxing as well.  fitXR only has a couple of scenes/places to work out, and they are all fictional.  In supernatural you're in a beautiful 360 degree place - the moon, mars, salt flats of Utah, Beach of South Africa, temples in Egypt, hot springs in Iceland, and so many other places.  

FitXR has mostly avatars for training and form, supernatural is always a live person.  They both provide standard instructions during the workout.  Where FitXR lacks is that you just start a workout at full pace, Supernatural has a slight warmup and cool down intro/exit, as well as instructor lead stretching, I like this slot, definitely adds a bit of legitimate class feel.  

Music - FitXR is generic songs, you won't sing along to anything or be able to anticipate a beat.  Supernatural has a very broad range of hit music - Country, pop, rock, hip-hop, classical!  You do not get to chose your song for either though, but supernatural has workout sessions geared to a music genre.  It's fun punching and swinging to Imagine Dragons and 90s grunge! 

The bit detection in FitXR is really good, I find it better than Supernatural, and the pace is typically easier to follow in proper form, I get out of sync in SN more often but I know what I'm doing in FitXR at all times.  One reason is that FitXR is always in the same direction, SN has you turning left and right as well, definitely more movements.  I like both, but incorporating 360 degree turns gets you using more of your body, plus you get to see the gorgeous scene you're in.  

FitXR is a better price for sure but whatever you enjoy and will stick matters for a couple bucks.   Try the free trials of both to see which one you like more, I choose SN, but will see if FitXR is able to upgrade their platform in few months.  I don't think they will catch up to Supernatural anytime soon though."
980,CassieR,"Jan 9, 2022 at 6:39 AM",1,Should be called Supergreedy,"Adding additional profiles does not work. Trying to add another just attempts to create a new account for more money. Already overpriced. Ridiculously so when only allowing 1 person to use.

Supernatural’s beat based workouts include an enormous and evolving catalog of hits for every genre with the most delightful instructors. Im absolutely obsessed!

As someone who is in fair shape but has been seeking a genuine cardio experience for the home, I’m so thrilled with how challenging this experience always is. I always finish with a sweat (1 round bats, 2nd round boxing).

The music is downright fantastic. I keep leaving shocked that songs I am in love with both new and old are included. Club bops, rap, punk, rock, disco, pop, party, classical… DISNEY! The variety is fantastic and the instructors truly encourage you to push yourself but also to have an amazing time. Not to mention the experience is just beautiful. Love it all."
982,Just Me,"Jan 25, 2022 at 9:07 AM",5,Got me moving IMMEDIATELY,Ok so I purchased the oculus quest 2 mainly for fitness. First low intensity workout and I was sweating but was determined to get through the whole program. First session I completed 50 minutes worth of exercise and for the FIRST TIME in years I was able to burn 80% of my daily goal for active calories in less than an HOUR … I have had 2 personal trainers over the last 3 years and I couldn’t get these results !  Needless to say I look forward to cardio now and I enjoy the large selection of music so it caters to my mood… the instructors are encouraging so even when I feel exhausted I keep going until the level is complete… the content is great… the visuals are great… and I happily move forward to my weigh training afterward…definitely sore lol… worth the subscription.

983,Tucann,"Feb 16, 2022 at 5:54 PM",3,Not Terrible,"There are a lot of great things about this app. The coaches are pretty great. Rainer Pollard is always a blast! 
The songs are good and the game itself is a lot of fun.
I’ve been doing it consistently for a couple of months and unfortunately the more I use it the worse it seems to get. 
When I started I was getting triple platinum and diamond on most workouts (boxing) and as time has gone on my speed has decreased to a horrible level. I know I’m not getting slower so I asked how speed is measured. I got a long equation of how it measures you against yourself after 20 workouts and the rest seemed like some algorithm that I can’t imagine can be correct. 
All that aside, I usually do 3 workout blocks in a row which is about 45 minutes and it has gotten to the point to where I just don’t get a good workout anymore. 
I tried a different app and did one session and I was destroyed the next day. 
The point is that this is fun and it’s motivating but it’s more of a game when compared to other workout apps. That makes it overpriced. $19 per month isn’t a bad deal is you are getting your butt kicked, but if you are in good shape (unless you maybe wear weighted gloves) this won’t get the job done. 
I can’t justify the price anymore. It was fun though."

987,WrightShot,"Dec 30, 2021 at 2:31 AM",2,"Good App, Bad Membership Plan options","I enjoy the app, it makes workouts fun. The thing I dislike is the ""4 Profiles Per Headset"" I have a headset and my brother has his own headset. Competing and working out with others encourages people to stick with their workouts. I made the purchase with the intent for us to compete and workout together. He would have to use my headset for that to be possible. ***Key point - with covid going around, who would want to share an item that causes a person to sweat. The fact that the only way to share is by using the same headset is a huge turn off. While I like this app, I'm currently looking for another app that either doesn't have that restriction or has more reasonable pricing for people that do want to compete or workout with others on another headset. With covid going around, please take this ""same headset"" option into consideration and change it so that it doesn't have that restriction, because that's the only thing preventing this from being a 5 star rating."

I will get close to a perfect round and then there’s a stall in the program. To me, that’s unacceptable for something I’m paying on monthly. It worked fine up until two weeks ago. Sometimes the first set has no music or it will be music from the warm up and doesn’t go through the whole set.

991,armshah,"Oct 29, 2021 at 9:13 PM",5,Supernatural is extraordinary,"Paying monthly or annual subscription fee when majority of other apps are one time fee (+ small fee for added song) is a huge leap of faith for the developers that they have something WAAAAY better than other apps. Supernatural delivers it. The similarity betwen SN and Beat Saber stops at both giving u sticks. Beat Saber is 90% fun/entertainment where SN is 90% workout. I am overweight w lots of added COVID pounds. I started w Beat Saber just to wake up my long asleep body. Then I gave SN  a try. This thing is extraordinary. You feel very close to coaches. They have different personalities so I guess over time u will prefer one over the others. They talk during the workout session, although for someone like me, sweating, battling to just finish the workout, at times I can't focus on what they talk about. Sceneries are outstanding. The music library is great and has extremely wide range of genres. The app gives u detail of your workout like ur accuracy and power which are nice. Although I am not sure how accurate these r. In many workouts, I feel I miss quite a bit but then the app says 97% accuracy. Nonetheless I dont care much about this data. 
I am still in the 30 day trial session but unbelievably I may do the annual subscription. 

One comment that I hope developers read is in some workouts they put the user on top of the mountain or between ground and sky ( like the great wall of China).   I can't do these workouts. When I moving from one side  to another, I get a feeling that I may fall. I had to stop these workouts cause at minimum they weren't fun. Would be great if the workouts are noted for the position that u will be in so we dont start the workout and then stop in the middle. The library is large enough that one can find enough workouts done on the solid grounds if they r labeled as such. 

And btw I didn't tell u that with just one week of use I have lost few pounds which is always a blessing.

Addendum: they add boxing. A lot more fun, a lot more intense, a lot more huffing and puffing. More content for boxing please asap."

I do feel so good after doing the workouts on Supernatural, but although not as visually stunning, I started using FitXR (despite the reviews,) and I am REALLY liking the longer sessions.

1001,Kimberly,"Jan 18, 2022 at 9:18 PM",4,Amazing! Only needs a Skip Song button.,"I absolutely adore Supernatural! 

I have always been VEHEMENTLY opposed to working out traditionally. I hate everything about exercise, so I've had a really hard time over the years finding a way to be active regularly. Supernatural makes me forget I'm working out, and makes me want to keep coming back for the fun. I've never found a way before now to actually enjoy exercise, and the way this app is set up to give you just that experience is perfect. 

My only major complaint, is Supernatural needs to add a ""Skip this Song"" button. Nothing kills a workout/playlist you're vibing with more than when a song you find boring or dislike comes on and you HAVE to listen to it before you can move onto the next one. This has come up quite often, and has killed my energy a few times mid workout. If they added that option, this app would be hands down the best workout option in the oculus store!"

Definitely give it a try and go through the ""Getting Started"" trainings, I bet you'll be hooked like me 😎"

So I did 11 min of the High intensity. I feel every muscle in my body ache. If you’re like me and didn’t want to subscribe

I'm finally 3 weeks in and actually wake up and hour before I normally do just to work out. That's huge for me, I hate mornings. Then when I get home in the evenings I do more. Absolutely love this and happy I made the purchase. Hopefully I'll see results from my hard work soon enough. My only complaint is that i wish there was more boxing work outs."
1011,Scott,"Jan 20, 2022 at 5:01 PM",5,1 of the best workouts for Oculus,"I bought my Oculus 2 mainly for exercise so I have been trying a lot of the exercise themed App and I have to admit Supernatural is the cream of the crop thus far!  The trainers are actually human.....I enjoy their short warm ups and then right to the workout.  Their input appears as if they are actually watching you (but many of us make the same mistakes, so the reminders on form are nice)   Graphics are awesome and the selection of music is amazing.  Ranging from the oldies to current songs.  
For a monthly fee, and one that appears to be higher than others, one should expect great content and so far Supernatural delivers!!  I have been very impressed with all the workouts thus far.  Twice I reached out to support to ask a question and on both occasions, received a prompt response.
Conclusion:  is it worth the month fee (or yearly subscription) So far it appears so, at least for me as I am looking fwd to working out. Few times now I had planned on doing 1 or 2 of the workouts, next thing I know I am on #3 and have a good sweat going on."

I’m a chunky person and really love this app. I usually have so much trouble even thinking of working out but this app has given me motivation to even want to do it. I love it! I’m definitely going to pay for the subscription. I do hope they’ll add way more of boxing and the flow workouts. Maybe give the option to mute Instructors or a skip tutorial button if a workout has been done but you want to re-do it again. Hopefully with this new motivation I stay determined to shed all this fatness. 😭
1014,Shanna Hinkle,"Jan 20, 2022 at 6:59 AM",5,Awesome,I love it! I workout every day. The only down fault I have about it is I think the headsets needs to stay changed a little longer and they need to add a little more exercise to their program and I wish supernatural could have you working out with someone else together but other than that I have no other complaints. I got my daughter to get one.

1019,BuoyantCitrus,"Dec 29, 2021 at 2:00 PM",2,"Unresponsive support, useless coaches","For the amount they charge per month you'd think they'd pay for support that actually responds to feedback. Instead they're spending all of their money on celebrity coaches. 

The coaches, as they are, are useless. They're not commenting on your success or failure, they're just talking. And there's nothing you can do about them.

The hit detection is really wonky. When you don't hit perfectly, the spheres fly back out amongst all the other ones that are approaching you so it can become confusing which sphere is next. To borrow from other rhythm games there should be less score for not hitting perfectly and the target should just disappear with less of a flourish or something.

Nothing is adjustable. You can't change the colours of the targets, the bats, the spaces between the beats, nothing. You can't even tap the bats against each other!

Overall this game feels like something some vain gym nut came up with with little to no consideration for usability and all consideration for looking pretty."
1020,FIEFER,"Jan 18, 2022 at 7:20 AM",5,It's a great game,"I love supernatural, honestly I started with fitxr and thought that it couldn't be topped because of the fun boxing workouts it had, months later supernatural made their own boxing workout and it's leaps and bounds better. Great environments, coaches are fun and it's without a doubt challenging and you get a great sweat. If you have friends on oculus you can compare scores and streaks. I'd like to see supernatural keep updating their multi-player features so perhaps one day you could do a yoga class or a boxing session without other people, weather that be a group class or just with a buddy beside you. Only other thing I would like is more aggressive songs for hard mode of boxing, so far they all seem pretty casual. Would love to have some metal music or adrenaline pumping music to a hard difficulty 🤷‍♂️ that's me though. Great game, bit on the pricey side tbh but with covid and gems closing constantly I feel it's 100% worth every penny. Much better than running on a treadmill staring at a wall. Thanks supernatural"

I’m trying to teach senior citizens how to use virtual reality in this seemed like it was going to be the perfect program. I would love to know if there’s any sessions that are comparable to the intro session in speed. ￼

Jan 2022
Fast forward a couple of months. I do this every single day and it has literally changed my life. I still think it would be nice to have a few super slow songs just so people can get into the workouts. They have a few. You just have to stick with it. I still do the Lows and I still do them sitting on the corner of my bed because of the issues but I do get quite a work out. The music is great. If you want more info check out the review on the Washington Posts Launcher site. It really gives you a great feel for the program"

Being a homebody now this makes for a great workout and I’m sure as vr gets better this game will only follow suit. I recommend stretching first before every workout as that’s probably the only  thing keeping my able to go to work and move properly. I cannot wait to see my results in a few months time. I’m really excited

Also I started with the 1 month plan and the seven day trial to see if I like it before dropping a whopping 180 USD for the yearly but if I like it as much as I did today going forward I’ll be signing up."

I've been using it for almost a year, and I still look forward to it daily! The music selection is amazing, the coaches are incredible, and the community is like no other, supportive and inspiring. Completely worth the monthly subscription price, even cheaper if you just pay for the year! Try the free trial, you won't be disappointed!!"
1026,Will,"Jan 17, 2022 at 2:56 AM",5,"A Bit Pricey, but Worth It","The FIRST thing you should do is calibrate the height settings. I was getting really discouraged that I couldn’t keep up with the workouts and had to ignore the squat/lunge triangles. But after I calibrated to make the squats/lunges not so deep I could keep up fine and workout for longer. 

It’s not cheap to subscribe, but it’s worth it for me. I’m terrible at exercising regularly but with Suoernatural I exercise at least 4 times a week for 30-45 minutes. 

Good music selection too. Updates regularly."

I am doing medium flows but still on low impact boxing. I have been doing 3 days on and 4 days off for right now. I have been doing these workouts for a little over 4 weeks and I have actually lost 4 pounds now, which is really a great incentive. I am hoping to add more workout days to my goals soon.

Firstly the price $28.78 is far too much for what this provides.
Next customer support is basically nonexistent.
Am unable to access my paid subscription after update and unable to use the app in general.

I was down five pounds in five days, and I didn’t even notice how hard I was working my quads in those lunges,, how my arms were burning, until the workout was over. Try it, and before you know it, you’ll be dancing between strokes or punches. Totally addictive."
1034,Sammy Frederick,"Feb 7, 2022 at 10:21 AM",3,Ehh,Not very great in my opinion. It's like Beat Saber but with a trainer in the background. The only great thing about this app is the platform you stand on that tracks your feet when you workout. Don't know why other vr apps don't have this its  much more convenient that having to take off your headset to make sure you're facing the right direction. But other than the genius platform you stand on the workouts are pretty mediocre.
1035,Tmd,"Feb 7, 2022 at 7:07 AM",3,keeps crashing,"I bought a 1 month subscription after the free trial.  It was fun and got me active and I didn't mind the coaching voice-overs or the music selections. Unfortunately, after about 2 weeks, the app kept going dark in the middle of workouts and it would take several seconds to a minute to start back up again. Occasionally the guardian area was messed up.  Also, I remember there being an option to skip the warm up during the trial week, but I didn't see that option when the subscription started.   I ended up canceling the subscription because of the gliches, but had planned to cancel after a couple months due to the exorbitant price for the subscription."
1036,Hollie,"Jan 23, 2022 at 4:01 AM",2,OMG Shut the Coach Up!!!!,"I love the Supernatural workouts. They’re amazing and a fun, innovative way to work out. Unfortunately, I equate loathe the sound of the coach’s voice saying the dumbest, generic, useless things and disrupting the amazing workouts. Even turned down as low as possible, the coach’s voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard. I cherish the precious seconds where the coach isn’t chattering and I can admire the scenery and enjoy the workouts. For the love of God and all things good on this Earth, please give us a MUTE option for the coach’s voice!!!!!

Some hard or heavy rock options would be nice. And what about old school Rock and roll? I'm only in my 30s but working out to fun 60s Rock and roll is my favorite.

1057,Sam,"Dec 12, 2021 at 6:24 PM",5,This got me off the couch!,"This app does not come cheap, but it is well worth the price tag, in my opinion.  Here's what I like about it and what I think could be improved:

What I Like:
-Beautiful graphics!  So many of these apps have terrible 3D graphics.  Instead, Supernatural takes you to beautiful locations around the world for your workouts.  I like to have something pretty to look at while I'm exercising, ok?
-Library of music.  This is so important to me.  I want to enjoy what I am listening to, and I am kind of picky, but their licensed library of music is diverse enough that I can find songs I like for my workouts.  Remember, that music costs money to license and that is part of what you are paying for in your subscription fee but I think it's well worth it.
-Responsive customer service
-The coaches - you can't turn them off, and some people find that annoying, but I generally find them motivating and helpful.

What could be improved:
-As diverse as the music library is, adding even more music would definitely be a plus!
-Please add more boxing workouts!  I love them!  Right now the majority of the workouts are flow (with bats like light sabers where you slash the targets), and I like that too, but I absolutely love boxing.
-The ability to skip a song I don't like.  It stinks when the songs I like are at the end and I can't skip the first couple.

All in all, this app was worth the price of admission for me and I use it nearly every day."

1060,JingWoSifu,"Jan 10, 2022 at 9:21 AM",5,Thought it was a gimmick,"I've always liked gamified exercise, but they have all been either gimmicky or it took a long to to buy into their concepts.  I got an oculuss for the kids, but decided to give the trial a go and I'm glad I did.  Not only is this app oozing with design quality, but everything has a very professional polish to it.  Even though I know the coaches are recordings, they don't feel like it.

I found workouts that I like to partake in.  The Bat or Beatsaber workouts are intense and can really work the legs. But I found my favourite to be the boxing workouts.  Having retired from teaching martial arts, I found myself out of shape, and with an onset of wrist arthritis, hitting heavy bags and doing pushups and pull-ups, like I used to was out of the question.  

Supernatural gave me my passion back for stance work, strikes and guards. I can work out at a level that is comfortable then take it up a notch if my wrists are feeling ok.  

Yes it is subscription but this is one of the few instances where I personally feel that it's worth the asking price.  Thank you again for re-igniting something I thought had pewtered out in me."

And it shocked me that I got sore from this. Never really associated vr with working out. Boy was I wrong lol. It’s so cool how they incorporate lunges and squats into what is essentially a more sophisticated version of beat saber. And the pre-recorded coaches that lead the workouts are great and really supportive! The background during the workout is also wonderful to look at. 10/10 this app is shockingly good!!!!"
1067,Kenneth Stewart,"Jan 8, 2022 at 10:05 AM",5,First impressions,"First time working out, I am exhausted. This app has my fat screaming, my pores sweating, and my mouth thirsty within the first minute of exercising. It's fun, and I may consider a year's subscription if I see results by the end of my second month. And by results, I mean anywhere between 5 and 10 pounds."
1068,Rafael,"Jan 28, 2022 at 11:24 PM",4,I’m in trial period and very impressed !,"It’s definitely a very good app, the scenery great, the choreography very good and the coaches could be a little annoying sometimes but in general very good too, many different workouts with excellent music.
Now here’s my only issue, I understand you want your dollars because you’re doing a good job and a good investment and you deserve them, but you have to understand that for us that live outside the USA, the price increases a LOT with the exchange rate and the fees that banks charge for the transactions, and that’s the reason I will take other options and NOT continue with you.
I hope you adjust your monthly and yearly fees according to other countries possibilities, if not it becomes too expensive."
1069,Marlo,"Jan 24, 2022 at 12:38 AM",5,You should see my moms bum,"This program works. Put in the effort and you will get results.  The music is awesome, the choreography is impressive, and the coaches keep you connected and focused. I love Supernatural. ❤️  100% worth the money."
1070,Feng,"Jan 28, 2022 at 1:54 AM",4,"Great, but needs some changes.","I wish you can play workouts in any difficulty. I have moved up from low intensity to high. Low and medium just don't cut it for the max amount of calories I want to burn in a certain time window. I'm not really interested in other music categories other than hip-hop, pop, and a couple others that are in the minority. Once I get through those, I'll just have to repeat them till they happen to release another in high intensity. Who knows when that could be? A week or a month? Also, some songs get repeated in other playlists too often.

Last is please give the option to leave the workout at any point and not just certain times. Sometimes I find the music choice boring and have to exit out of the game and launch it again."
1071,Lilly Netanya,"Jan 8, 2022 at 2:04 PM",5,Really fun and addicting,First I wasn’t Into the whole vr thing but after playing this game I want to keep going this game makes me come back for more I don’t like working out but this game is fun the music makes me dance while hitting the targets the coaches keep me motivated to keep going everything is well done
1072,Matthew Kabel,"Feb 17, 2022 at 6:39 AM",5,Work it Out!,Amazing app! I burn as many calories doing SN as I do on my elliptical. Definitely worth it!
1073,Allen Smith,"Dec 21, 2021 at 11:15 PM",5,Just wow!,"I'm pretty active and either go to the gym or get some kind of exercise in every day. I was looking for some workout options for when I don't want to do spinning but want that level of intensity. 

I have to say I have been very impressed with Supernatural so far. I am completely immersed in my workout without being overly focused on how much time has passed or if I'm almost done yet. (You all know those workouts when you look down and it's only been 10 minutes of a 30 minute workout. 😂 )

Flow is just so much fun and I can't believe how much it pushes my heart rate into zones 3 and 4. 

While the cost of the subscription might be off putting for some, I just have to have more of this kind of workout. 

Good work Supernatural!"
1074,Ohm,"Mar 16, 2022 at 3:35 AM",3,"Sorry, Beautiful but way to expensive.",I loved the intro and the games seemed fun but the Subscriptions are just to pricey.
1075,AngietheAries,"Jan 5, 2022 at 2:39 AM",5,Great workout,NEVER been so excited about working out. At first I was like nah I can’t do this every day because the low intensity boxing workouts were still kicking my behind! But then I did the flow workouts with coach dwana and I spent an hour and didn’t even realize because it was so fun and not as intense as the boxing. I look forward to this app helping me reach my fitness goals.
1076,StephEl,"Jan 5, 2022 at 4:37 AM",5,Is it a workout or a game?,This is the most genius invention to gaming workouts ever. I'm obsessed and addicted. I don't wanna stop!  It's like playing your favorite video game and you are disappointed when you have to go to bed or school or whatever and you can't play longer. I'm a 47 year old former D-1 athlete who totally fell off the wagon from burnout after college. I've been married 24 years and have 3 kids..dedicating my life to my Lord and my family. I've found Supenatural and it's made me change my perspective on exercise. It's so fun and rewarding.  I just can't say enough. Invest!  Way cheaper than a gym membership!
1077,Trinacat,"Jan 30, 2022 at 4:01 AM",4,Love it,I absolutely love this workout I love the coaches and everything about it especially Tiffany Haddish the only thing I do not like is that it is not how multiple players I wanted to connect with my sister who also have a VR and maybe we can be in the same room together or a different houses but on the same game at the same time to work out and we was not able to do that so we had to pick another workout game on the app they have multiple players but I love this workout app better but  I will absolutely recommend this one
1078,slightly45ed,"Apr 3, 2022 at 8:42 PM",1,Nope,Says free but wants 180$ a year to even play why
1079,Reenie,"Jan 9, 2022 at 9:52 PM",5,Finally a workout I Love!,I hated working out until Supernatural! I have an old ankle injury and everything made me feel defeated. But with SN I feel powerful and strong!  The coaches are amazing and when they call you an athlete it makes you try a bit harder. You won't regret getting Supernatural.
1080,Wendy,"Dec 17, 2021 at 10:56 PM",3,Cannot cancel subscription??,Hi I’m trying to cancel my subscription before my trial is over but I cannot find the place to do so either in app in my headset or online… it’s not an app that challenges me to work harder but it’s well designed. Just not for me. Can you please help me cancel the subscription?
1081,Jen_Diggs,"Jan 23, 2022 at 3:36 PM",5,,Had the the game for almost a year. If you actually do the work out you get results. At first I played around. Then I tried getting my numbers up. And oh doy my body was in pain. But I lost the wight.
1082,Peter,"Jan 25, 2022 at 10:40 AM",3,Solid 3.5 stars,"First off, I prefer this much more than Beat Saber for working out. However, Beat Saber has multiplayer and better res than this app does.
The biggest complaint I saw was from people who wanted pure music and no voice over from the coaches. This app does offer different volume controls so that you can reduce the coach's volume, but it will not mute them. I found this to be an acceptable compromise.
Pros: 
- Two main workouts are good: Boxing and Bat swinging (Beat Saber style).
- Includes Mediation and Stretching.
- They all play out over very nice scenery (lakes, mountains, desserts, historic / archaeological sites, etc.). All seemingly nice.
Cons:
- The voiceover from the coaches. There's a reason why this is a common complaint. However, I turned down the voice over volume when I don’t want to hear them, so it doesn't bother me as much.
- Pretty pricey for an app. It can cost as much as some actual gym memberships, so you better be using this!
-  BLURRY BACKGROUNDS! This really bothers me because every exercise you do is set in a relatively nice environment but it’s blurry! EVERY one of them! I originally thought it was me until I realized that the menu font was clear and sharp. Very disappointing. This is especially bad for meditation because looking at the scenery is a big part of it. They obviously collected a good amount of scenery, but they aren’t showing us the HD version. It’s like looking at a DVD movie when you’ve been watching HD for years.
- No way to block certain artists or songs. I almost quit this app when I saw an artist that I would NOT support in the early training routines. I just turned down the volume and finished the set and luckily, I haven’t seen his/her music again.
Conclusion:
I would recommend that you try this. They offer a trial membership and I’d suggest doing at least a month more to see if it’s a good fit. I really enjoy it so far. 
Don’t expect a super great workout but it is much better than doing nothing.
Finally, Coach Leanne!!"
1083,Grogu,"Jan 10, 2022 at 10:42 PM",5,Great start to the day,Supernatural is an amazing way to start and end your day! I wasn’t sure what to think about using my oculus as a way to work out but I’m so glad I tried supernatural. After doing a couple work outs I was all in. I’ll definitely be getting a subscription
1084,KBandaleas,"Jan 7, 2022 at 7:25 AM",5,So much fun,"I'll keep it short and sweet since other reviewers have hit the high points. I'm in love with this app. It seriously kicks my butt. I love trying to beat my own score for accuracy and power in hitting targets. I hope they keep adding more songs, but it's got a great selection."
1085,Scorpioness,"Jan 14, 2022 at 7:51 PM",5,I FINALLY enjoy exercising!!,"I've always hated going to the gym. Actually I hate sweating, however with this game I'm so excited to push myself further. I still hate the sweat but love the interaction much more. Never been this excited to workout after a full shift!"

I’m trying to do other workouts but it won’t let me. So I can’t try any other workouts. So frustrating. Won’t be continuing the subscription.

Not great at the flow workouts yet. More like dancing but a great workout as well!"
1090,Trex,"Jan 1, 2022 at 3:13 AM",5,Love love love!!,My whole family LOVES this! I personally love feeling immersed into places around the world and then get to workout to legit real songs - not karaoke style - but my favorite is the classical music. I drip with sweat and can’t even feel it because of how amazing they do with keeping you busy and entertained! The trainers are funny and super motivating. We did the trial and then got hooked. We all have our own profile. ￼￼We recommend this 110%!!
1091,Tracy,"Feb 4, 2022 at 3:04 AM",5,Best workout ever!,"I love everything about the app! The workouts, couches and music choices are phenomenal! I’ve never been so excited to work out."
1092,Lunaz,"Dec 31, 2021 at 10:50 PM",5,Best work out program I've tried,"I like a variety of work outs and tend to get bored. I'm on day 6 of the free trial of this and plan to pay for the monthly subscription. This work out app has made me excited to work out and gets me motivated. I can already tell I'm getting more toned. Highly recommend for someone who likes a variety of work outs, likes good music and likes to sweat and wants to try something new! Also I never write reviews!"
1093,Ebony,"Feb 8, 2022 at 4:12 AM",5,So fun,This is literally the only game I really play. It is so fun and helps with weightloss. So worth every penny.
1094,Val,"Dec 30, 2021 at 11:50 PM",5,LOVE SUPERNATURAL!,I can truly say that I never found a workout or a way to stay active that I enjoyed until I found supernatural! Not only is it great workout but it’s super fun I don’t even really see it like a work out until later when my whole body is sore! Everyday I wake up excited to do a supernatural workout!! If you’re someone that finds it hard to work out and want a way to do it that is actually fun and makes you want to come back for more each time then this is the app for you!!!! Totally worth the subscription and more! The only thing I wish was was that it had more Spanish songs on the flow workouts! I’m a total Spanish song lover and I really only saw them on the boxing workouts and I’m still getting the hang of those!🥺
1095,Sarah,"Jan 6, 2022 at 5:07 AM",4,So so fun!,"I just got this app and I was so unsure about it! I am glad I purchased it! I don’t ever feel like I’m working out! If I didn’t sweat my butt off every time I honestly would never realize how hard I’m working. The only thing I wish you could do, would be to pick your music and pick your backgrounds. I love the coaches and the overall concept but sometimes I just don’t care for the music so I’ll turn the volume down and listen to my own music. Otherwise great game and definitely great workouts."
1096,Joseph,"Mar 4, 2022 at 8:57 AM",1,,It’s free but the thing that sucks is that you have to pay to play might I well make the game cost 20 to get the full version
1097,Sandra,"Dec 30, 2021 at 5:20 AM",5,Amazing!!,"I love this app!!  It is truly the only thing I have found that makes exercising fun for me.  The choices in music, levels of intensity are great.  The virtual environments are  breath taking while not too distracting.   By the time I’m finishing my favourite workout I am giving my all and feel energized and  f*%#king powerful, blasting out the lyrics to Lizzo’s Like a Girl while I take those final lunges - LOVE it!  Well worth the monthly subscription!"
1098,JektoBTC,"Jan 14, 2022 at 10:24 AM",5,Favorite way to workout.,I’m obsessed with this app. I do strength training and then 30 mins of this and feel fantastic. Boxing and the bats are both super fun. Definitely worth the monthly fee if you’re using it at least a couple of days a week.
1099,Tara,"Jan 10, 2022 at 4:28 AM",2,Not that fun or effective,"I love exercise apps and particularly was excited for VR. Unfortunately, the execution of supernatural was pretty bad. Was more like a boring basic dance app with very limited moves. My heart rate went up but no more than any other movement game. The instructors talk a LOT - which hurt my workout. There was also absolutely no strength building moves. I had to workout after. The boxing mode is way better than the other mode, but still - it’s just basic. Don’t waste your money or time"
1100,Tewpher,"Dec 28, 2021 at 2:50 AM",3,classical music,"i purchased supernatural specifically because i saw an ad with great workout-appropriate classical music. the app has a lot going for it, but i feel misled by the ad. the ads boast that new workouts are constantly added, so I assumed there would be no less than 20 classical workouts. :-( the actual classical music selection is minimal; musicals, soundtracks and some acoustic pop are listed under classical. there are only three workouts with symphonic music. Bizet, Beethoven, Wagner, Verdi with Coach Leanne would all be welcome additions. despite the scant selection, however, the quality of the recordings is pretty good.
I really like the actual workouts. i feel great after working out. the motions feel safe for my joints and i get my heart rate up even on the easy exercise routines. the settings are lovely and the app is pretty easy to use.
unless there are new classical recordings added to the repertoir, i'm probably not going to continue using the app."

I look forward to getting my time in every day!"
1104,Cheese,"Dec 29, 2021 at 2:50 AM",5,out of shape and ❤️ this app!,"I don't know what it is that makes it so incredibly fun! It also makes me really happy! I swim and I go for long walks several times a week but nothing makes me as happy as this game! I can't squat as far as the trainers can so I just do my best and I am on the lowest setting which is a workout for me. it is super fun and the first time I played for I think over an hour and I had no idea I've been on for that long!  I really, really appreciate that the platform underneath me is not that far off the ground. To the developers, please keep this feature in place because some of the other apps have you off the ground and it is very unsettling and uncomfortable for me. I like how I can select my own music genre and select the type of workout we are doing. I also like it if I get really tired I can stop doing the squats and then just keep hitting the black-and-white balls which is so incredibly fun. I originally was looking for an app that I could use with my stationary bike but haven't found one yet. I have use this on my stationary bike and I just bike and do the arm bit and ignore the squatting bit. I haven't yet done the meditation and I intend to do that soon. I tried the boxing and I liked that also. thank you to the developers for creating such a great app! And please remember, please please continue to keep The platform underneath me very close to the ground! :-)"
1105,imaddog12,"Jan 30, 2022 at 1:28 AM",1,Unacceptable,Typical attempt to trap folks into buying an app that appears free at first. I downloaded this and then was told about free trials. Of course they state that you can cancel at any time. Good luck figuring out how to cancel! I cannot find how to cancel in the phone app or on Oculus.
1106,KC,"Dec 28, 2021 at 5:45 AM",5,Like full body beatsaber,"I was drawn to this because I love boxing and have done it off and on for years (fyi, I'm female). I did the tutorial for the ""flow"" and already I was drawn in. You are doing squats and lunges while slashing targets. Great music to go with it. Then I did the boxing and I have to tell you, I love it. My legs and arms hurt so much, but I was having so much fun, i couldn't put it down!  Form wise, that is for the most part on you. If you are a beginner,  start with more of the tutorials. Even if you are a pro and know what you are doing, start low so you get the feel of the controls and how the movement works. Don't worry, you will get a workout!  I found it easier to keep my wrists straight if I held the side trigger down on the controller.  This way I can have more of a loose fist like boxing. You do slips and squats. It is fantastic!"
1107,LeahPeah925,"Jan 18, 2022 at 8:49 PM",3,Gorgeous scenery/not enough music I like,"You can’t argue that the graphics and scenery are amazing. And I’d pay for this app all day long if it just had more music I like. I can’t seem to find a workout that has 3 songs I enjoy all together, or that even have one song that I know and/or like. Many have songs I’ve never even heard of. I wish there was more current rock/pop like Beat Saber has now. I need music I enjoy to connect with the workout and the workouts become limited in Supernatural for me because of that."
1108,mystyrica,"Nov 9, 2021 at 10:49 PM",1,Misleading - paid subscription required,"UPDATE: regarding the developer response 

If you KNOW that the subscription model is surprising, then do something about it! Pretty simple, just update the product description from ""Subscription Available"" to ""Subscription Required"" 

Your response seems a bit condescending and juvenile. We know there are expenses to developing a product and I don't blame anyone for the costs of dev/marketing/etc. associated with supporting a game. But the bait-and-switch approach is not a way to encourage buyers to trust you. Be upfront about your costs and you'll get users who know what they are buying and are happy to do so. 
________________

Well, I didn't actually get to use the app. While the description says ""Subscription available"" the reality is you can't use it at all without a subscription. Yes, they offer a free trial period (7 days), but you have to pick an annual or monthly subscription to do anything.

This isn't a free app with additional features available for additional fee. This is a subscription service and is not available if you aren't willing to spend $20 (with taxes) a month to use."
1109,dlayne,"Jan 18, 2022 at 8:41 AM",5,Awesome App,I had been wanting to work out but couldn’t get up the motivation….until I bought oculus. I have every fitness app available and yes I am on all of them daily. I look forward to Working out.
1110,Fischer Builds,"Dec 9, 2021 at 6:09 AM",1,Are they kidding?,"Downloaded this bc I wanted to exercise using my Oculus. The instant sticker shock was enough. Nearly $200 a year… FOR AN APP. Before Covid my REAL gym membership with real equipment and actual facilities cost $9.99 a month, far less than this app. This is pure greed and unrealistic value. I’ll never use this and now it’s in stuck in my apps so I get to review it having never played a single second."
1111,Julie,"Dec 11, 2021 at 7:02 PM",5,Amazing and worth it!,"I have been an absolute Beat Saber fanatic for almost 3 years now. I started in PSVR and actually purchased the Quest 2 just for Beat Saber….and then I tried Supernatural. 

I am totally converted!!!

This is an ALL OVER body workout!   And there is a greater selection of music. So much better! 
Even though the high intensity workouts seem much slower than Expert + I get a much better workout because of the squatting etc. 
I was at a plateau with my weight goals until I tried this. I can’t say enough about it. ABSOLUTELY worth the monthly fee. 

I see some people saying the trainers should be an option, and at first I thought so too but I realized they are really important in making sure you keep the correct form so you don’t injure yourself so you can do more!
Many times I have strained myself on Beat Saber and had to stop playing for a while but I don’t find that with this game. 

Definitely give it a try."

I can see people's scores via added companions on the supernatural app .

Overall:
It is a great daily workout!
Burn just as much or more than fitxr
Unique and variety: Movements feel natural and if done right workout your whole body and every boxing or flow class feels unique. Warmups definitely help! Dont recommend skipping at all
Interactive: coaches are motivational and ive never had better posture. Their tips are on point its like they are right there with you.
Music: THANK YOU. LOVE IT

The views are very nice though but there are free vr apps to see nice views but they don’t have any workout aspects. Sometimes I think this interval training is too easy. I wish we could make playlists so our heart rates stay up longer. I also got bored with it after a few days. I wouldn’t use this as your only workout routine. If you can afford it and want to use this mainly as a way to relax or unwind, get it. Otherwise, look elsewhere."

I'm updating my review now that SN has included boxing. Still 5 stars. The boxing is amazing. I love having a whole new set of movements. I feel like the boxing complements the other workouts. Same great music. Same great coaching. 

I was completely hooked after my first workout. I love the music, the mapping,  the beautiful locations,  and the coaches. For the first time in my life, I'm enjoying working out. I jump out of bed in the morning eager to put on my headset and play. It wakes me up, puts me in a great mood and gets me ready to crush my day. I get in a second sweat session after dinner as stress relief as well.

There's a Facebook group full of other people who love Supernatural and it's the most supportive,  positive group of people ever. 

The developers actually listen to the players about ways to improve the experience,  which I think is fantastic. 

I love that there is a new workout every day and new music being added all the time. 

Do yourself a favor and try out the 30 day free trial."
1125,Kelsey,"Feb 3, 2022 at 1:08 AM",5,Great workout,Makes working out so much more fun.  Crazy sore the first few days. More Disney songs PLEASE!
1126,Vlad,"Oct 27, 2021 at 6:16 AM",4,Mute the trainers voice please,"It’s a really really great fitness app. You sweat a lot, move a lot, work your arms, shoulders and lower body (if you squat on triangles). Great variety of songs and tracks....BUT country music does not belong with workout. Those 2 don’t go together. 
I would give it 5 stars if you could mute trainers voice completely. Some of them (well only one) has the most annoying high pitched voice and sometimes screams like a girl... once I played a ‘L’ workout and was very slow track and the trainer was screaming like he had the most intense workout ever! Just horrible.
Also would be good if trainers stopped repeating themselves. You notice it when you start playing everyday and a lot. 
Other than that the app is AWESOME! (For workouts)

Update: the new boxing 🥊 update is AWESOME! It’s even better then freestyle in terms of getting a workout and sweating…. But still keeping at 4 stars until you give us an option to mute annoying coaches!!!! Or make them talk normally at least!"
1127,Jose,"Jan 18, 2022 at 1:04 AM",1,They got me not a free trial,I canceled before the 1 week free end date and they still billed me. Checked today and subscription was still active and set to bill yet another month.
1128,Angela Rohm Setiadi,"Dec 31, 2021 at 8:32 AM",1,Scam,"I thought this was free due to false advertising, downloaded it and it offered a free trial I refused to start. Immediately I deleted the game but it says purchased however I didn't purchase anything nor did I start that trial. I have flagged my bank account that any charges from this app is a scam and not purchased with my consent. There is no way to remove this app either. It is a total scam and I will sue oculus if you take money without consent. Also based on the other reviews from others who started that trial there isn't a way to cancel it. Oculus you need to step in and protect your customers. Remove this app"

1130,Ajalee,"Dec 22, 2021 at 6:38 AM",5,Just what I needed,"I’ve been trying to lose weight and one of the things that experts recommend is to find movement that makes you happy. I’ve finally found that in Supernatural! The scenery, the music, and the positivity coming from the coaches is outstanding. And having it in VR really gets me out of my head when it comes to “working out”. I feel so powerful when I play! I’ve played every other day since I got my Oculus. And that’s only because I need a day of rest in between to let my body recover because it’s just so fun that I don’t know when to stop lol. Looking forward to getting better at these workouts!"
1131,Nyxx,"Jan 17, 2022 at 3:53 AM",3,Not for the uncoordinated and a bit $$,"First...the price is just too steep for my budget. The selling point being that it's cheaper than most gyms, and it really is, but still out of my range. I'd have forced room in the budget for it if I thought I could really use it though, however...

I also just don't have the hand-eye coordination, speed, balance, or a big enough space to get into this one. I tried both Flow and Boxing and couldn't make 1/4 of the targets.

The coaches though, are excellent!  The scenery is gorgeous (though I wish it were customizable per workout). For someone who's already physically inclined, I think this could be a wonderful app."
1132,carson,"Jan 17, 2022 at 1:38 AM",2,Nice app but overpriced,"Look, let’s get one thing straight if you can pay a big subscription, get this app. It pretty overpriced.. Don’t get me wrong tho, it is a good app. It got me sweating in just an hour. I got this app to lose a bit of belly fat that I had to complete my wants. But when I realized that it had me paying a $20+ monthly subscription, I was was befuddled. I did a few songs and canceled the subscription then and there. I was kinda disgusted at that because I could go to my local gym and pay less. (I workout at home) The song selection isn’t to good either but It wasn’t to bad. The worst thing was canceling the subscription. It was difficult and frustrating. I bounced to the oculus app to my emails to a sign in and overall, it was a lot of time and cussing."

If you like beat saber but actually want a workout download this. And make sure you’re in gym clothes when you play. My biggest request is to get better modern tracks on this as a lot of them are dated. But we’ll done! Keep growing the app. 

I adore the coaches too."
1136,bs87,"Dec 2, 2021 at 12:30 AM",2,Obnoxious Coaches,"As many other reviews state, you can't mute the coaches\trainers and they are just obnoxious at times. We don't need to ""hear less"" or about how each course is ""thoughfully curated"", some of us simply do not want to hear them at all. The workouts are good, but forcing in your face coaches on us prevents the app from being enjoyable for some. I would subscribe if\when a full mute feature is available. Please don't bother responding with your copy paste garbage that is on every other review, focus on developing the feature people are asking for."

I am in my late 20’s and been wanting to get some exercise for a while now but hate just going to the gym and doing random stuff. Supernatural changed all that for me! I am currently on the 7 day free trial and loving it! Being told here is what you exactly need to do is amazing. I am doing the boxing class and wow it was a great workout! So far great music to listen to and the instructors are excellent! Will right another review after a few months!
1146,Dawn,"Oct 21, 2021 at 8:14 PM",4,Superior Virtual Workout Experience,"This is by far the most superior virtual workout experience available.  I am a personal trainer and am always looking for new, fun and inventive ways to work out and this is one of my favorites.  I know many people talk about not wanting to hear the trainers but I think they add to the experience and they legit get me fired up (Coach Doc is my favorite).  The only thing that is keeping this from being 5 stars is the price point of the monthly subscription.  I would be willing to pay half of what is currently being asked but almost $20 a month is too high to maintain for me considering my gym membership and any other classes I pay for.  Please consider reducing the monthly subscription cost."
1147,Austin Owens,"Jan 16, 2022 at 9:49 AM",4,Expensive,"This app is fantastic but the only problem is that it is more expensive than what it should be. $18.99 for a month is a lot, that’s what a gym membership costs. This is a good workout but we aren’t lifting weights or anything so I think the price should go down to at least $10"

I HATED going to the gym because people stare or judge and I don't have time in my day with work and family. Most gyms don't have child care and I need that. With supernatural I don't need a sitter or to even leave the house. Plus I WANT to ""play"". Gyms are boring and there's no excitement or drive to make me want to go. My 7 year old LOVES video games and doesn't get much exercise aside from jumping on my couch. This has changed that for him."

1181,Ladyalia,"Nov 5, 2021 at 9:29 AM",4,Almost perfect,"Let me start off by saying this game is phenomenal. I normally get bored of everything really quickly, but I've been playing Supernatural almost every day, for at least one hour at a time. I never played the game for workout purposes, even though it's a good cardio. I play this game because I freaking love the songs, and it's keeping my inner ear stimulated so that I dont get dizzy as easily. The trainers are a little irritating, but I normally tune them out, and go about my day. With that said, I honestly wish there is an option to completely mute the trainers for people like me who doesnt really care about the workout, and are just there to smash or hit things to the beat of the music. I adore orchestra, and I was stoked to do the playlist. I was so annoyed with the grating voice of the trainer talking about facts of the piece that is completely irrelevant to ""working out."", and yelling ""breathe"" every 5 seconds. It's like somebody talking about the actors in movie when all you want is watch the freaking movie. I want to be immersed in the music and the beautiful scenery and graphics while smashing things. that's it. also wish that we can pick and choose individual songs and difficulty levels to make a personalized set list, without a trainer of course."

1184,bootybxndit,"Dec 9, 2021 at 1:54 AM",5,Beautiful app/Massive music collection!,"One of the best apps on the entire VR market. The best workout app hands-down.

It admittedly took some time for me to get use to the home workout dynamic(as opposed to a gaming dynamic) but after finding workouts with my favorite music, this has become a non-issue. I’ve only done Flows, and the newly implemented Boxing workouts, but I have thoroughly enjoyed them. It’s definitely an aggressive workout but it’s still fun and very engaging. It’s not totally immersive, and I do think that is because of the home workout dynamic, but it’s also not totally immersion breaking. 

They have what is likely the largest music collection on the entire VR rhythm game market. So it’s not a question of whether or not you will like the music. There is music for everyone, including 6 decades of pop music across over a dozen sub genres; As well as workouts for classical music and other World hits."
1185,John Michael,"Dec 9, 2021 at 6:56 AM",5,Awesome and keeps getting better!,This was good at first but now with the addition of the boxing it is GREAT! I did not like the monthly cost at first but now it just blows all of the other apps out of the water! The only thing that may give it a run for its money is Thrill of the Fight 2 but who knows when thats coming?!? This is the best fitness app and is far better than FitXR for the money!

1189,Tom,"Dec 13, 2021 at 7:51 PM",5,Great Workouts (Know your limits),"UPDATE: I say know your limits because I threw out/pulled my should joint doing one of the harder modes. I do find that the jump from low to medium is even a lot harder. Be careful throwing your arms around!
I didn't expect to like this as much as I do. I'm still on the trial but absolutely will continue the paid subscription. People who think this is a beat saber clone are misinformed. 
The song library alone puts beat saber to shame. They are completely different experiences.
Plus there is boxing which is very well done, you truly feel like you're bring trained, I love the bobbing and weaving.
Also they are constantly adding new routines. The trainers are diverse and keep you engaged. I do wish you could select single songs to play from a list. But they have work outs under 10 minutes which is nice and you can quit at anything moment. 
The sweat cushion/silicone protector is a must, your headset will get sweaty. I typically have to stop between songs to clean it off lol. 
There is also meditation and stretch routines by them self. 
They recently added a Deftones song which was fun but difficult. 
Would love to see some fun modes added in the future"

Gets your heart rate up while you are moving and having fun for a painless workout so good you’ll feel it the next day without even feeling the boredom of a workout! Stunning scenery and excellent coaching in your own home. You’ll never go back to the gym. It also allows you to set up the workout to your own comfort level and adjust as you advance if needed. Can barely squat?  You don’t have to. Full squat desired? Set it up so you move to your best potential. Works out both cardio fat burning as well as muscle toning for peak performance in a fun way with great music in futuristic settings while you travel the world and even workout hovering over a molten volcano!

I’ll stick with Beat Saber and the occasional $10 music pack cost.   I’ve lost 40 pounds without Supernatural and will continue without you.   I pay less for annual Microsoft Office license.   Uninstalled the app from the start.

1201,SpeedAsian,"Dec 5, 2021 at 10:54 AM",5,This workout is a game!,"Where other similar games are focused on being games first, Supernatural is focused on being a workout first and game second. Which is great. 

Other rhythm games let you choose the song and get to it, which is fun and a workout, but Supernatural has you more so focused on a type of workout, they choose the music so you can’t sit there and spend more time flipping through a catalog than you should. But the playlists have enough variety and get refreshed often considering their ridiculous music library to choose from. 

The games themselves are actually great! Sure it’s not the neon arcade feel of *ahem* some other games, but it’s engaging, different enough, and has a variety of workouts and meditations even. I found the boxing to be my favorite as it keeps me moving and really throwing punches rather than flicking my wrist around to slice things. 

The coaches are great too! It’s nice to have a reminder “keep moving your feet. Shift your weight. Rotate the hips, watch your shoulders on this part” so it keeps you aware of form and reminds you to execute the movements for a good workout rather than completely gamify it. 

Now the price. Yes. It’s subscription based. Yes at the time of writing, it’s more than a World of Warcraft subscription. But this is a basic building block to getting exercise. No excuses. No feeling drained after work and having no motivation to get to the gym after or forgot your gym clothes. Your quest 2 is portable, it’s easy to jump in, and it’s a workout that is fun and encourages you to workout. I’d say it’s worth the price for me personally! Hope you found this novel useful! Cheers!"

But Flow musics are toooooo old! I heard the target users of this app is 40+? Well this app absolutely is neglecting younger users like me. Please at least allow users filter by song publish year! I had to click each playlist to check what songs it has and that was annoying. And why can’t I just play single songs like Beat Saber? I understand it’s hard to mingle coach audio with individual songs but hey, I don’t need coach on flow games. So just let me toggle off coach and pick whatever songs I like. Please please I don’t want to spend $18 each month to listen to nanny music. 

If the Supernatural team want to do some user research to support purchasing new songs, talk to people in their 20s and ask if they’ve been enjoying the songs. I doubt anyone would be positive."

2nd problem with this app is its over priced. It's cheaper to buy beat Saber with the add-ons for the same workout.

3rd problem they promised a free silicon visor for signing up and I've never recieved it. False advertising."

1252,Frelix.Arcadia,"Nov 23, 2021 at 6:03 AM",5,An amazingly good workout!,"I've been a regular gym-goer for nearly four decades. But I've never really been able to find cardio I enjoy. I always pushed myself through it. But once I found Supernatural on my Oculus tm 2,  I found cardio I enjoy! I actually look forward to coming home and doing these workouts on my ""rest"" days. The coaches are all great, the workouts are fun, and range from easy to ....yeah this is going to kill me. Get it you won't be sorry"
1253,Ojayy,"Nov 30, 2021 at 11:35 AM",3,It's Beat Saber but better* songs!,"Well, it has more popular songs and saves me from modding Beat Saber. I've played this game a few times and I'm definitely sweating. I'm not a fan of the coaches (I find that they just remind me I'm tired rather than me just zoning out to smash things) but you can lower the volume on them but not completely. 

I do like the variety of songs however, it's not like Beat Saber where you can pick a single song to play as well as select a difficulty, 2 features I wish they had. If I had to pick one, if would be the ability to select a single song. Alternatively, if there was the ability to skip songs within a play list (like how you can skip warm ups and cool downs) that would work too. I found myself standing trying to find a playlist with the first song being one I wanted to play but the songs I knew and wanted to jam to would be in the middle of the playlist. The ability to create your own playlists would be a welcomed addition. 

Another thing I found rather annoying is the setup. I just wish it was quick and easy rather than a whole video to play through. What would be nice is allowing a force skip through the dialog to make setup even faster and better (text) cues to how you should be positioning the controllers (think flashcards).

More features that would be nice to have is one to set reach length (besides faking the setup) I find that I'm actually swinging and over extending that i have some discomfort the next day. 

Otherwise if you're new to VR and looking for set playlists and a challenge and something that will make you sweat, this is a great way to start. Definitely take advantage of the free trial as the subscription is a little expensive (but not any more than a gym membership)."
1254,Matt,"Nov 19, 2021 at 11:02 PM",4,Great Workouts. Meh Navigation,"The workouts are great. For understanding my fitness level - Ive been doing strength training regularly for a good while and would consider myself to have a “somewhat athletic” body type. That said. I haven’t done any cardio unless you count burpees; mostly because I find cardio boring. 

I started out very skeptical with this app since it looked like an expensive beat saber knockoff. I was very wrong.

The targets are designed for you to swing your entire arm to hit them, not flick your wrist like beat saber. Once I got into the habit of swinging the arm instead of flicking the wrist, I became used to playing the game for 30 minutes and walking away breathing very hard and dripping with sweat from literally everywhere. changing clothes after playing Supernatural is not optional. It feels really good to now be incorporating cardio into my workouts, and I actually look forward to the workout which is nice.

The coaches annoyed me at first, but I’ve grown to like them and sometimes laugh out loud at their corny jokes (so…so corny). 

The content is great and definitely worth the money. If I could give partial stars, I’d probably give 4.8 

The reason it’s not 5 stars for me is: I’ve found it to be very time consuming to identify workouts I want to do.

You can add several search filters, which is a big help, but that feels like a minimum viable product for this functionality. 

I think they could improve this easily enough by adding additional sorting / searching capability, and maybe have a “recommended for you” area where they look at workouts you’ve rated highly and make suggestions based on other workouts with music by the same artists, or same songs, or same decade released, or whatever. 

It would also be nice if they would show you what genre a given workout is tagged as when you look at it. Some of the songs I’ve never heard of and don’t care enough to open Spotify to hear a preview. Just showing the genre might be enough to help me decide if I want to try it.

It would also be nice if, when looking at a workout on the mobile app, I could swipe right / left to go to the next workout on the list. Instead of having to click the workout, read it, then click back, then click the next workout. It’s a small thing, but tedious for no reason. If I spend 20 minutes tagging workouts I want to try. It’s a lot of back and forth which feels unnecessary.

In summary, great program for workouts. The application itself is just okay - not terrible but has some “low hanging fruit” opportunities for improvement."

But it is missing some KEY features to illustrate progress. Namely, there is NO section to input your height or weight information. No section to get an estimate of calories burned. Nothing. These are essential elements to any fitness application. It's great you can pair a smart watch or some other HR tracker, but if you cannot get an idea of calories burned, then who cares?

1263,CU,"Nov 20, 2021 at 2:45 AM",5,Just incredible technology,"When I bought my quest, I honestly didn't give too much thought to using it for ""real"" workouts. But that has become my main use for it. This app is just incredible. It's the first no brainer yearly subscription I've purchased on Quest. I never tried it before the boxing, but that's the game changer for me. It's just done perfectly to give you a beat saber feel with throwing real jabs, hooks, uppercuts, slips, etc. The thing about these workout style apps are that you just want to keep doing more, because it doesn't feel like working out. I'm burning about a thousand more calories a day from doing Quest stuff now. That's insane. 

Supernatural is the best of the bunch for personal trainer style workouts. It's very similar to Les Mills style classes with music cues and coaching. I used to teach these classes, so I understand the importance of the coaching. However, there are times where I'd like the option to turn them off. I have read where you mentioned a licensing issue. You may have to provide commentary over the songs to use them...I don't know. Being able to license that music from Spotify, and build playlists and workouts around genres, is just the cherry on top to keep coming back. You're never going to get bored when they are adding multiple workouts a week. I couldn't be happier. Hopefully they can come up with more workout styles to keep it even more fresh. I'll be happy to beta test. Menu's are clean and easy to navigate too. Well done developers!"

1266,LALA,"Nov 30, 2021 at 12:04 AM",2,Don't want the trainers,"I like the cool places and such, but I don't need instructions every time I work out, it's the same thing over and over. I've taken kickboxing and it is annoying.  I don't need a cheerleader either. I want to zone out and smash stuff. I wish you could just do a full 60 min workout without all the talking. I probably will cancel after the free trial because I find them a waste of my time and don't know how to make them shut up. Imagine if every time you logged into beat saber it made you do a warm up and gave you instructions on how to hit the blocks, then talkes to you. There's so many requests for this to go away. And the response is always the same generic answer. Listen to what people are requesting. A 12 min work out is nothing, esp when they want half of it to be a warm up or warm down. I warm up on my own, I dont need to swing my arms around so that it feels like there's more content than there actually is. Some of us are on a higher level than that."
1267,Tequilla2Blades,"Dec 9, 2021 at 10:23 PM",4,To much,"I like the game. Like alot. My only issue is the $180.00. Give me a plane for $10 or even $20 a month and I would sign up. Also look at the free to play market out there. Lots of ways to sell the tracks individually. Also I hate rap, but thats just me and I can deal with the tasteful use in this setting.

1276,CHO,"Dec 11, 2021 at 9:30 PM",4,"Great game, but motion sickness","The execution of the workouts is absolutely fantastic. The flow modes put a new spin on beat saber. The monthly price is a bit high, but for a fully coached workout at home, it's way cheaper than even the cheapest gym memberships. 

The downside all comes down to my level of comfortability. I am fine in most games and play beat saber for about an hour a day without any issues. But this game made me sick within 20 mins of playtime. There are two possible explanations as to why it happens here and not in others. The first is that they use real-life images/enviornments and I think that does cause some disorienting in my brain. One of the work outs was on top of an active volcano and I think that threw my brain for a loop. Second, the workouts go full 360 in some modes and the spins definitely contribute to the motion sickness and loss of balance for those who are susceptible. 

All in all, I think the game and the subscription price are worth it and a great way to get in a cardio workout. I just think it isn't for me, and it may not be for everyone if you have a tendency to get motion sickness under certain conditions."

1280,Justin,"Sep 24, 2021 at 3:59 AM",5,Better than Beatsaber,"First of all obviously this is way more expensive than most quest apps, but plenty of people have argued well for it’s value, so I’ll just say whether you can afford it or not is up to you. It’s well worth it to me, and I played a ton of Beatsaber before Supernatural.

My opinion: Supernatural is better than Beatsaber. The songs are better, the gameplay is better, the atmosphere is WAY better. If you enjoy more realistic and awe-inspiring vistas, like you find in games like Brink and Real VR Fishing, you’ll love the environments in Supernatural.

I understand the criticisms of the coaches talking over the music, but anyone that’s ever done any kind of fitness class will find this familiar.

You say with mods Beatsaber is better? Maybe for you, but for me it was too much effort and waiting with every update, I’m bored of single lane levels and there aren’t enough 360 levels, and I’d rather support a completely legitimate product anyway in the hopes they can use the money to improve and contribute to the advancement of VR in general.

Devs: It’d be nice to see a list of all the locations, and/or be able to choose different locations at will."

1285,Quickscope,"Oct 31, 2021 at 10:42 AM",5,a very polished and professional app,"Update: October 30

  So they've added boxing classes. This app was excellent beforehand, boxing took it to a whole new level. For those that are looking for a home workout solution, you should consider this as a serious option. Way more fun and affordable than smart mirror home gyms and much more immersive. 

   Just a thought to consider for the devs, If one day the Supernatural devs can figure a way to utilize hand tracking,  maybe consider adding strength building classes with some free weights. I'm not sure if this would be possible while still being safe, but it would be a great addition if it were. Or you could consider adding cycling classes.

 This app is great either way. :)


Update: October 17

  I have a library full of fitness apps. Initially I didn't commit to the subscription and canceled after the free trial. For 3 months I just used non subscription fitness apps. But I'm back to Supernatural and now a subscriber. It's the only fitness app I use. 

   Why? Because of convenience and effectiveness. It was much easier for me to push myself every workout with this app. Its curated with workouts targeting specific areas of the body I need to work out that day and makes workouts much easier to stay with. 

   The UI has improved even more since my free trial, so it means this app is constantly changing and improving. The app storage requirement is very small, which is a benefit for those with the 64GB quest 2 models.

The trainers/coaches are great and help encourage me. The only downside is that it's a bit cringe when some of them start singing along with  the music. But for the most part they are great and add to the experience.

All together im very happy with this app and decided to use this as my main quest 2 app."
1286,Garbo,"Nov 21, 2021 at 1:52 AM",4,"Broaden the options, please!","Nearly perfect! So far, I really love the workouts and as a former dancer really appreciate the choreography of the moves with the music. For me, getting to know a routine and striving for 100% in accuracy and power is more valuable than novelty. Also, as an older player (59) I would appreciate some slower music/lower cardio options so I can do another session later in the day or on “off” days.

I second the request for the option to mute or dial down the coaching once you are familiar with a routine. Coaches are great, but again I am likely to repeat a routine multiple times, so the coaching becomes repetitive and intrusive on the eighth time thru. 

TL;DR: we oldsters like repetition vs. novelty and want some slow routines too."

I haven't been able to workout consistently for a couple of months ...but I don't even mind continuing to pay for it because I know the value will still be there when I can get back to it (hopefully in a couple of weeks) that value will be waiting for me.

1297,Kaizen Ultra,"Nov 11, 2021 at 6:29 AM",5,"Put it off for along time, however!!!","Let's get the basics out of the way, gained weight blah blah, but for the past year I had gone to a boxing gym and learned how to box / kick boxing. However it was just taking up to much time and quit the gym.

Started to not work out so I headed to oculus to do fit XR, but stumbled into SN, I was a little annoyed that I had to put my credit card info in right away before even trying it, but whatever I really wanted to try it and I am sure glad I did.

I've heard of SN when it first came out, but I was put off by the monthly sub. But I guess timing is everything seeing as the boxing feature just came out and it puts fit XR to shame. They have added everything that I thought was missing from fix XR. MUCH BETTER dodging, weaving etc, faster pace, better songs and better pace from having breaks with between different songs. Plus having different environments to be in that are fantastic. 

At first I thought the 180 a year was not going to be worth it, but when you think about it, for this type of experience 15 a month it's really worth it, seeing as I was paying 80 a month for the boxing gym. While not the same experience as an actual boxing gym, it's a good substitute when you already know how to box.

I have not tried the meditation or stretching yet so I can't say anything about that, but the boxing is on point and the beat saber thing is pretty great too and work well together and maybe combo set in the future however that would work out? 

Seeing as I am going to be a paying member here are my 2 cents on what to improve and what could be added. 

1. Trainers are great, but was annoyed that I was forced to do the tutorials when I just wanted to start and figure things out on my own.

2. I agree with the other reviews that there should be an option to turn off the trainers, kind of takes me out of the full workout experience and getting in the flow with the music with them in my ear. I have ADHD and it's very distracting for me, but also at times motivational, depends on the mood I'm in, so the option to turn on and off would be great. 

3. I don't know if the settings are off or what, but for me the boxing hit points are way to high, I had to recalibrate to make my self way shorter for it to feel natural.

4. Not sure if this is an option, but hands free hand tracking for the boxing would take this to the next level.

5. If you take anything from my suggestions please look into how to do this. KICK BOXING. I would think you would need to make leg trackers for the kicks that would go around the ankle. This could be something that we would have to buy from you so we could do this. but at the same time if you made the tech for this and so it works with oculus it would have bigger application that would go beyond SN. So I would think it would be a money maker for you, but if there is something already in the works from someone else that you could get it to work with SN for kick boxing module. I would live for this!!! 

Super natural is fantastic and I see the worth in it, plus the app on the phone that gives the details on your workout. 700 punches I did not realize it was that many. 

It's a great experience, I'm sold after 3 work outs trying it one time."

1316,Frysaucy,"Nov 4, 2021 at 8:31 AM",5,I love it,"I bought the Oculus quest 2 in a last ditch attempt to try and enjoy exercise. Ever since VR started getting more popular I kept thinking, heck yeah I'd be fit if I could run around in my favorite shooter games and play for real. The tech isn't 100% there yet for that but Supernatural is the first real workout app to embrace VR to it's potential. Since I got the quest and began using the app, I've exercised consistently at least 4 times a week. The cool thing about it is, I always tell my self I'll do AT LEAST one of the 17 min workouts, but I've only ever done that once. I always end up doing more. It's so fun. It is also a good workout if you're doing it correctly. The only thing is that after doing boxing, the high intensity flow workouts are almost too tame. 

I also love that they take our feedback and song/genre requests from the email surveys. (Send more!!) They added a film score playlist which I had been waiting for. The workouts also surprise you as well, I love classical music and thought the classical workout would be boring in terms of intensity and the one with Hungarian dance and Carmen is BOMB. I've don't it the most. I only wish you could skip songs or create your own playlist but I'm sure there are reasons why we can't. My only feedback for these is that you can't search by song, and when all the workouts have generic names, it sometimes makes it hard to find what you want quickly. 

The coaches are so great. They all seem so nice and for the most part, I enjoy their interjections. I like when they tell us personal anecdotes about the music or their lives and when they remind us about our form. I don't necessarily need all the positive ""you got this!"" stuff.

Oh, lastly, I wish I could keep my streak on the app even if I skip warmup and cool down. Sometimes I do something else and don't want to do them, but I have to sit through them to keep my streak."
1317,Melissa,"Nov 24, 2021 at 11:35 PM",4,Excellent,"I hate exercising. Really, truly hate it. What I love about Supernatural is that it doesn't FEEL like I'm in a gym doing cardio! The serene outdoor environments are SO awesome! I will sometimes even use the meditation programs and do planks and other exercises that (for obvious reasons) Supernatural doesn't have.

Some suggestions I have for the developers: I would love the option to be able to choose and set my own location for the session, and/or exclude ones I don't find appealing from the randomly generated ones (some days, I just don't feel like boxing on a volcano, ya know??) Being able to filter locations like I can music style/intensity/coach would be a great addition. It would also be nice if workouts could be marked as ""completed"" so I can see which ones I have already done.

I did take off one star because I've found that sometimes the tracking can be a little off/buggy. I'm not sure if this happens because I'm pretty short (5'), but for the most part the targets often feel like they're out of reach, and the boxing targets seem a bit high. I have tried resetting guardian, as well as fully clearing the guardian history. Going into the ""Experimental Features"" and enabling the ""raise view"" setting helped a little, but still seems like the game is built for taller people, because with that setting I end up towering over the instructor which feels kinda strange.

The new boxing classes have been super fun! I actually prefer them now to the flow workouts. I find that the angled bars (slips/bob and weaves) are far more intuitive than the triangles signaling squats. (I understand the concept, but personally find them really awkward...perhaps ""bolding"" one side of the triangle to signal which one to lean away from or implementing some kind of color scheme would help?) 

I'd love to see the stretching workouts expanded. I really love these, but am getting bored having to repeat the same ones before my workouts. Having some really long ones would be great too, for days when you don't feel like sweating but still want to move a bit (or for the day after Supernatural has kicked your butt and you can hardly move!)

1324,AgentAva,"Nov 2, 2021 at 12:07 AM",4,Update,"Update— After having problems with FitXR glitching out big time, and hearing that supernatural had boxing, I decided to try another month.

And I love it!!  I found that I sort of missed the trainers too. They really are relatable and great.￼￼ 

I love the music and with the addition of boxing it’s a whole new ballgame. It is said that the best work out is the one that you will do. I find myself looking forward to supernatural. I was starting to dread going to fit XR because of the glitchy problems. You carve out time to work out and then it wasn’t working. 

Supernatural is always working. Yeah I don’t like the monthly fee but I do like that we can count on them to keep things running and updated and offer new workouts, like adding boxing. Great move supernatural! ￼

——

I really enjoyed the work out when I first signed up. I like all of the trainers and the locations are awesome. But after comparing it to fit XR that doesn’t charge you monthly, I’m going to have to unsubscribe to this. I just don’t think it’s worth charging that much every month.  They have workouts in the low medium and high realm and the trainers remind you not to get “dinosaur arms“ and just chase the targets. Yet if you go anything above low and some of the mediums are OK, you end up chasing targets and not doing big stretches with force. You get more points on the harder levels but it seems like it’s ripe for shoulder damage.  I also have an issue with the music. If they spend so much money I’m getting so many great titles it would be nice to be able to create your own work out with songs you love or at least more easily access the playlist you like. It’s a great idea and I hate to cancel but I just can’t support something that’s going to charge us $20 a month. I don’t think it’s a good idea to do this with other apps moving forward. Many people do enjoy it and maybe you will. But I found that I’m starting to get bored and frustrated by it. They have added up to four people on one account and one home. Maybe that will help for you but if you live alone that doesn’t offer any benefit. Like anything, I would say give it a try. If you love it, then keep it.

1325,Benis,"Aug 11, 2021 at 10:49 PM",5,The best of the workout world in apps,"Our family all got an Oculus back in March. Quarantine weight was absolutely a motivation but omg. I wasn't expecting to get so hooked! As of today I lost my Quarantine 30 pound gain PLUS another 10 pounds. I hate gyms because I hate people, this is absolutely the most ideal form of working out there is to offer. Germ free, zero judgment, being comfortable in your own home and the coaches are all so great!"
1326,Mikey,"Nov 16, 2021 at 7:53 PM",5,Amazing game,"I love this game, and in my opinion so much better than beat saber. The one issue is that in the boxing segment, when you are doing multiple punches in a row, punching a target doesn’t always register, hence breaking a streak."
1327,Aurora K,"Nov 1, 2021 at 10:56 PM",5,Great workout,"I am personally struggling my hardest to get back to the weight I used to have when I was in my teens which is around 155 and 160 pounds. It’s like watching and performing in exercise videos only with your headset. The monthly plan is a much cheaper option for me. The workouts are well executed and it’s similar to other games like beat saber. You sweat a lot more than when you played Wii fitness on the Wii. You sweat even more than if you played bowling on your headset. It’s well executed. Highly recommended. It’s so ideal for a workout on the go just as long as you have strong Internet. Unless I can afford a much smaller carrying case for my headset, it’s likely I’ll only do workouts like these on a road trip or at home."
1328,Frantic,"Nov 8, 2021 at 6:38 PM",3,Needs Way Lower Price. Awesome Though,"Let me start by saying this is similar to the other popular beat rhythm game, but superior for working out because the movements are designed, yes designed, to make you move.  The choreography is fun and well thought out.  You will sweat, and if you're doing it properly on medium or difficult, you'll be done after 3 or 4 songs.  That's efficient cardio, IMO.  
All that being said, I did not renew after trial.  It's just too expensive.  In a day and age with countless memberships, I cannot justify the cost of nearly $19/month.  For arguments sake, if a music subscription is nearly $10 dollars/month, but I'm only using a handful of songs each week in this game, I'm to believe nearly $10 dollars goes to Spotify for their contribution to this game?  And then, for arguments sake, nearly $9 to the developer each month to create the choreography?  There's no way supernatural is paying Spotify nearly $10 per account, so the profit is being made by charging handsomely a select few Oculus users.  I know new content is constantly being added and that's why I really see a future for this product, but, I truly believe the price for this product needs to be $10/month, and then who knows, maybe the membership could double, triple, quadruple?  I don't want to argue value here, but for me, it's just too much on top of my other memberships.  Hope to come back in the future at lower membership prices."

That had me looking into a fitness app. Admittedly it is a way better workout than beat saber but I get more winded playing creed. I do like the program and I will continue to use it for my 7 day(ads all said 30 day) free trial upon which I will promptly cancel. I do wish it was more reasonable but with standard gym memberships as low as 9.99 a month I can't see paying 20 for an app. Now if it were priced at 10$ a month I would grab it for sure. Who knows maybe in time the sub price will lower to reasonable. 3 stars until sub reaches 10 then 5 stars.

1338,DDM,"Nov 20, 2021 at 7:47 PM",4,Great workout game,"This is great game. Since my daughters bought me Oculus 2 VR set and this game, it has become my daily workout tool. I also tried some other workout games but this one stands out and I seldom go back to the others.

I also noticed that there has been big improvement in scoring like accuracy percentage and power percentage. Sometimes I wondered before which one I missed and how many I missed the target at the of each song. With improved scoring report, I will have good guess and better understanding how to improve.

Still room of improvement is to let me know what background I will expect before I start. I will quit the workout whenever I found in the next song the artificial scenes like “hero gate”. I just can’t stand in this type of environment in my workout.

I would also wish to see if some views with city life can be added so people like me can enjoy both nature and modem urban views."
1339,Brittany,"Oct 29, 2021 at 6:35 PM",5,The best thing ever,"I absolutely love this ""game"". It is legitimately making exercise FUN and something I don't dread doing. The music variety is amazing, the coaches are awesome, and the scenery is beautiful. If you're looking for an exercise routine this is well worth the money, especially now that they've added in boxing! Supernatural is honestly one of the best things to happen to me. I'm more active now and I feel better not only physically but mentally as well. I hesitated initially because of the price but I'm so glad I tried it out and don't plan on going anywhere!"
1340,TorRagnarson,"Oct 31, 2021 at 4:43 AM",5,Amazing,"First, I enjoy working out, but I sometimes lack motivation. I was cautious at first because I have a budget and want to make sure that I'm making wise purchases. I'm two weeks into my subscription and I have absolutely zero regrets. I am absolutely amazed at how these coaches can get me moving and how spectacular the music choices are, the workouts, the locations. I was sceptical at first and didn't think I would even make it through the trial period but I was wrong.  I have several debilitating injuries that keep me from my regular workouts at the gym and this was a solution suggested by a colleague who also uses the program.  Hands down the best workout program (and I've done many over the last 30 years) that I've ever had the pleasure of being part of.  Many thanks to the team at Within and Leanne Pedante and her team of amazing coaches for bringing Supernatural to my living room."

1342,Jip,"Oct 29, 2021 at 4:05 PM",5,GREAT workout for Beatsaber fan!,Absolutely love this app. My workouts are so much better than when I used beat saber and although it costs more I appreciate not having to try to figure out new mods to get songs I wanted. Really love the new boxing workouts! They’re so cathartic and really feel like I’m letting off a lot of steam. Would love to see more boxing workouts. Also like the new leg workouts with angled triangles. Love the ability to adjust volume of the trainer for workouts I’ve done multiple times. Wish I could rate each workout based on the trainer and choreography separately because sometimes I don’t like a workout very much but loved the trainer. Wish I could also see what I previously rated each workout rather than just seeing if I bookmarked it. I have very bad knees so like the option to change the depth of lunges and squats. I set them as standing and then just lunge or squat as best I can that day. Even when I don’t it’s a great workout! Might be nice to have ones already rated sort to the top (or better yet be able to drag and sort them yourself) based on how much you liked them. Thanks for this great tool!

1344,SugaMama,"Oct 28, 2021 at 8:49 PM",5,Amazing!!! Highly recommend!,"SN is by far the best fitness app on the market today. I hesitate to use the word ‘app’ because that reduces this to a technology, and SN is so much more than that. It’s a family, a supportive community. It’s access to personal trainers when you wouldn’t ordinarily them have available - and these coaches are real people who interact, support, listen, coach and encourage us. They make it fun! It’s the best overall workout I’ve ever participated in and will being you results if you bring the effort. Other fitness apps are weak by comparison. Kinda like going to Disney World and then going to a carnival. Don’t overthink it. Just do it."

Developers seem to really value and consider user feedback. Boxing was just added and seems like it’s going to be a blast! Can’t not say enough good things about Supernatural!"
1346,Jenna,"Sep 9, 2021 at 4:30 AM",5,Life-changing!,"I’ve always hoped to find a video game that would make working out fun instead of a chore—especially doing cardio workouts. I used to use the Wii, and there were some games that were okay, but it was still a chore to get myself to work out. Something I did because I knew I should, not because I actually wanted to. Supernatural is something completely different—it’s like an addiction! I was trying to take a day off today and found I couldn’t resist going in to do just a quick 2-song workout. The selection of music is great, and caters to many different tastes. The workouts are fun and well-thought-out, while also being very challenging. I love that each workout immerses you in a beautiful, breathtaking location. As a fringe, completely unexpected benefit, after doing Supernatural workouts for 12 days, I realized that my perpetually super-tight shoulders had loosened up enough that I could put my arms flat on the floor above my head when lying down. They used to stick up at an angle, and no amount of stretching, massage, or band work had loosened them up. So if you spend a lot of time hunched over a computer (or artwork, in my case), this is a great way to fix those tight shoulders!"

Beautiful locations, great coaches, and a fantastic workout. They just added boxing, so along with the stretching, and meditations, you need nothing else! It is truly a full body mind and spirit kind of workout! 

On top of that, it’s a great community! There are brunches and medal team challenges if you want or you can post your achievements for people to applaud or you can share your difficult day and get some support! 

I highly recommend just going for the year subscription because there were some times I needed a rest for a few weeks and I loved not stressing about missing out that month!

Also comparisons to Beat Saber is close but misses the mark at the workout you can get compared.  I find myself doing this almost every day to get a great sweat and I thoroughly enjoy the motivation you get from the coaches.  Sometimes it's good to be distracted when you workout to high intensity tracks with jokes, encouragement and even the occasional trivia and stories.  Also the settings are gorgeous and I wish we could walk around during the mediations that are offered which are both self and guided by one of the coaches.   I love the constant communication the staff gives both here and in the Official Supernatural Community Facebook group and I hope they continue to improve this fitness app from the feedback!

They now added BOXING to the workouts library!  It's becoming an all arounder with no others to compare!"

Supernatural fixes all of that! I even like the coaches!

I never saw myself paying a subscription for an exercise app, but was hooked the first day. It adjusts to your height, ability to squat and lung. Has so many different work outs and new ones daily.

1379,stillshardvark,"Oct 18, 2021 at 3:55 AM",5,ACTUALLY the best VR workout tho,"This is my first review which I was Inspired to write because Supernatural is so awesome. I wanted a boxing setup during covid but the reviews for in home boxing systems are bad and I got an oculus quest because I kept hearing about Beat Saber. And I love Beat Saber, but if you are used to working out you really have to push to make it a real workout. 

In search of a truly challenging workout on VR I have tried Stride, Dance Central, Beat Saber, OhShape, Superhot, Thrill of the Fight, and Audiotrip. Auditorip is actually my favorite because it is the most like real dancing, but Supernatural is the best workout with low threshold/entry level for mechanics and not needing to be “good” at the game to get a good workout. You can also keep going without interruption for long stretches and it is easy to pause. I honestly almost made myself throw up the first time I used it and it has been a long time since I did that (during HIIT at an actual gym In the beforetimes). 

I have read a lot of comments about the subscription aspect of the game, but I can tell you I cancelled my streaming gym service because this is better and more varied and the same price. 

Regarding the trainers that a lot of people don’t like, I think they are fun. I could imagine getting sick of them but as someone who has done workout classes and videos for years I don’t mind them at all. And the music is so much better than other dance games! I totally love this game and is it completely worth the price."
1380,Lance Seibenhener,"Sep 5, 2021 at 5:58 AM",1,"Decent game, horrible scheme","First, the game.  Yes, it is a game.  Essentially it is BeatSaber with natural backgrounds, more diverse music, and ""trainers"" yelling at you.  

BS has red and blue lightsabers cutting red and blue boxes.

Supernatural has black and white bats hitting black and white balls.

Oh and sometimes you have to squat down or lean in Supernatural.   Oh wait,  you do that in BS, too.

If that was it, this would be a 3 star review.  But then you have the scheme.  Like gyms and shady online supplements, they give you a free month and hope you don't remember to cancel the thing so they can ding you for $19/month for a mediorce Beatsaber clone.  

When you do finally complain,  they tell you that:

""We do not refund based on lack of usage. Please see our terms here.""

I am 95% sure that I didn't give them my credit card info, which is why I wasn't that concerned about 30 day limit.  I tried it our several times.  Pretty much hated it -- don't like Beatsaber that much and the ""trainers"" get repetitive and annoying pretty quickly.  Which means they are get your credit car info from the Oculus store . . .

Time to get a burner card (gift card that works like s credit card and that you can load with a small amount of money when needed).  Make it unprofitable to use shady business practices like charging $19/month for nothing."

I do understand why it's like that, since i got a comment  back from the developer but if the reason is the company the music comes from requires there to be something other than just the music, then let us buy the songs, minus the trainer yapping so thr company gets paid and I can listen to the few songs that the trainer ruins for me without them. I'd pay extra, even over the subscription fee, to not have to listen to the trainer on some of the songs. I'd even pay for the right to turn off the trainer per workout.. then I could just pay extra for the ones that the trainers irritate me, since the developer believes the trainers in general are an integral part of the app. I enjoy the warm ups and cool downs and the trainers are helpful sometimes but one of the trainers during the songs on one workout drives me absolutely insane, to the point that I can't even do the workout that I love the music to because his yapping distracts me so much I can't even enjoy the workout or the music.

Barring that, it's fun, and makes me look forward to working out every night. There's plenty of different music types, although I do wish it was less pop/rap/hip hop heavy but I understand that's what ""everybody"" listens to so those of us that don't listen to that stuff should be thankful for any bone we get tossed. And I do manage to find something every time I want to workout, even if it's just one I've done before and want to do better. I do actually enjoy most of the trainers, too, except when they break my vibe talking randomly about not workout related things during music.

Another thing that would be nice is the ability to make your own lists or the skip songs in workouts, so you don't have to listen to songs you don't care for just because they're in a workout with a song you love. But that can be gotten over. Workout is workout, even to music you're not in love with."

1397,Ken,"Jul 19, 2021 at 6:25 PM",5,Pricey but worth it,"Yes, $20/mo is expensive, even for multiple accounts (which I don't use). Yes, some of the songs show up on multiple playlists. And yes, some of the coaches repeat themselves occasionally.

And you know what? It's wonderful. Better than Beat Sabre or FitXR or even my beloved Sound Boxing.

Like FitXR, the routines are engineered to give you a full-body workout - the core work is surprising. Like Beat Sabre, the combinations are challenging. Like Sound Boxing, the music is great.

Where it stands above and beyond, though - and I can't believe I'm saying this because I normally hate this part - are the coaches. They are very effective at using the music to propel me forward, just when I think I'm about to give up. Thanks to their encouragement and the timing, I usually go from about-to-give-up to -take-it-up-a-notch. 

Most importantly, unlike a lot of the others, this one is sustainable. 3-4 times a week is pretty easy, even with a hectic schedule. The hard ones are about 25 minutes each and give a really nice workout.

This one is great. I hate paying $20, but they've got me. It's that good. (Note to Supernatural - I really, really hope that if I'm paying this much for an app that the people working on it - especially the coaches - are getting compensated fairly.)"

I didn't even use this app for more than 30 minutes and I unfortunately thought it would be a simple process to cancel my subscription, but they intentionally make it VERY DIFFICULT to cancel intentionally in hopes people will get frustrated and let it go.

This is absolutely unacceptable and people need to know that if they put their credit card info into this app, you will have a nightmare of a time trying to cancel. How does Facebook attach their brand to a business practice as shady as this? I won't buy anything else on Oculus store until I get my refund because considering you can't just go into your subscriptions and cancel (they don't list them), this is basically theft.

1408,kenmorefield,"Oct 10, 2021 at 7:36 PM",3,Mostly good with some glaring issues.,"I'm coming over from having used EA Active on Wii for many years. This is great.

Let's deal with the big issue upfront: either the subscription fee is a dealbreaker or it isn't. From my perspective, $15 a month is not too much given the cost of the Oculus 2, the paucity of games, and the fact that there is new content EVERY DAY.

Unlike some others, I like the trainers -- all of them. Some more than others, but all are helpful. I think the workouts are different with thought going into the order and length of reach. 

I've heard this compared to Beat Saber but the biggest difference for me is the MUSIC. There is so much more variety. I don't know any of the music in BS, so unless you want to add SideQuest, it gets old quickly. By contrast, there is always new content in Supernatural

I went ahead and paid the yearly rate, so it's $15 month, which is like 50 cents a day for a team of 5 coaches and new workouts every day.  

EDIT: I originally rated this 5 stars, but I've since lowered it to 3 stars, for two reasons. 

1) They need more stretching. In the 8 months I've had the app, they have added exactly three (3) new stretching routines, despite the coaches ""imploring"" us warm up properly.
2) For a community that prides itself on inclusion, it is very narrow (and somewhat hypocritical) about what subjects or comments are taboo and what is allowed in social forums. It's certainly possible to use the app and not participate in the community (hence 3 stars) but it's a drag to be excluded from support networks in and around the app simply because of who one is or what one believes rather than how one treats other members of the community."

First: NO NO NO it is NOT similar to beat saber. Beat saber is great fun and fine, and you'll definitely burn some calories doing that... but Supernatural is MADE FOR working out, it targets your different muscle groups, there is a physical science behind the movements, the way you have to hit the balls. They target the full body in a way you will have a proper workout and not just burning a few random calories whacking in random directions...

Yes it is a subscription but you get new content all the time, have real music and many many original songs, you have actual trainers, and the graphics are amazing! Where I live a gym membership is $80-$100 a month(!!) so this is cheaper and MUCH more fun!!!

Just try the free first month and see for yourself"

1430,Rae,"Aug 10, 2021 at 9:26 AM",5,Great Workout,"As someone who already owned beatsaber with a large amount of custom songs, I was very hesitant to get an app that would require a monthly cost. However after doing the free trial, I noticed a vast difference in the work out between beatsaber and supernatural. Both are fun, but I would be playing hard and expert levels in beat saber completely fine and yet my first workout with supernatural had me sweating within the first two songs (I skip the warmups and cooldowns).￼ This game is definitely engineered to be a full body workout and actively encourages you to move your entire body and hit hard. 

Like I said, I very much enjoy this app and appreciate that they have new workouts every day. However, I would love an opportunity to be able to play one song at a time; I’ll often see a song that I want to play surrounded by songs I’ve never heard before. In addition, I think being able to choose a specific song would let you practice the combos to more effectively do the workouts, or just open up more possibilities for quick workouts. Another note is that partial workouts don’t count towards streaks as far as I’ve noticed, which can be disheartening. Other than that love the app."
1431,HarpCat,"Sep 23, 2021 at 11:44 PM",5,loving it for a niche market,"I’ve read a lot of negative reviews about this app and I’d say it appeals to a very niche market. 

For example,  I’m not really into the typical psychedelic/neon style rhythm games, I’ve tried pistol whip and synth rider and neither appeals to my eyes and they make my head feels overstimulated after a while (maybe I’m too old for them). I love how supernatural incorporates natural and realistic scenery and I prefer this calming ambiance much more.


People complain about the pricing model. For me I’d rather pay a premium for something that looks and feels polished, keeps me exciting with new playlists daily, as well as familiar songs and variety of music (they even got classical music and country!). Sure you can mod other rhythm games but it’s more for  people who are technically savvy.


I also like the exercising aspects of this app and the fact that they include warm up and cool down songs. 

One thing I wish the developers can add is the ability to shift from one song to the next in the playlist. Sometimes I don’t have enough time for the full playlist and I’d rather just exercise to a couple specific songs within the playlist."
1432,Cassandra Strand,"Sep 15, 2021 at 3:18 AM",4,A great VR Cardio workout,"This does share some mechanics to other rhythm games like Beat saber (BS) or SynthRiders (SR), but its execution and feel is different.  Could you use BS or SR to get a similar workout?... yes, but they aren't optimized for it the way that Supernatural (SN) is.  SN has two bats that you use to slice through targets similar to the sabers in BS.  However, while BS encourages quick wrist movements, SN encourages wide expansive movements for a full range of motion.  SR encourages some of those larger motions, but not with quite as much intensity or movement.  Both BS and SR focus more on you hitting things from your stationary space though both provide obstacles to dodge and offer even 360* gameplay.  SN has more movement and bending objectives.  BS and SR are better for small spaces because you can stay in a smaller play area but SN can be done in small spaces if you are careful and maybe set up a boundary where your safe lines and orientation are.  You will move more to the sides than BS or SR though.

I find that the spacing that SN uses for their swings is also better placed and timed to avoid hitting your controllers against each other or yourself.  I notice I do that a lot more in BS and SR especially when they have the harder levels involving crossing arms quickly.  SN instead uses a more consistent wide spacing when both arms are in use together so that rarely happens.

SN is set apart not only for its fitness focus but also has the widest selection of music genres.  It includes oldies, disco, classical, EDM, pop, country, rock, etc... They offer workouts in 3 intensities like BS or SR difficulty levels.  But you can't select individual songs or intensity per song.  You do get new workouts each day and the UI makes it easier to navigate to workouts based on intensity and genre.

The biggest issues to me are not being able to turn off coaches during songs (licensing), long scrolling through full catalog, can't connect to Samsung watch and subscription model/price"
1433,Andrea,"Aug 23, 2021 at 12:53 AM",5,I am loving this app,"UPDATED to add a Developer request:  At the end of the full session when you are reviewing your results, it would be  nice if you could see little images with the names of the locations we visited .  By the time I finish a track, I'm lucky if I even remember the country.      
 
I have just started my third week of my four week trial period and l am loving it.  I make time for this daily.  It is easy to fit it in because it's done at home and you just put on the headset and get going. I look forward to doing it because it's fun and I'm already seeing results for my efforts.  It's a full body workout that I can actually do without aggravating any of my existing issues.  

Thought goes into the choreographed motions to make them smooth, albeit quick when you advance to the second level.  I suggest you try all of the music genres for a pleasant surprise.  The developers have done a really good job in giving you a  fun experience to match the music.  With Classical, they have arranged it so that you feel like you are conducting a symphony.  With Jazz, the moves required to hit the targets have you swaying and dancing with jazz moves.  Rock, you feel like a drummer.  They put a lot of thought and effort into this app.  

Yes, it's a subscription.  Thankfully I can afford it, but if I couldn't I'd give up something else so that I could."

Being able to sleep through the night without pain is invaluable. Three months in, I’ve lost weight, but more importantly I’ve lost inches. Working out is fun again. I can travel to diverse locations, broaden my musical repertoire, and discover muscles in places I didn’t realize muscles could be. I’m also enjoying the meditation sessions. I use the 10-minute ones to stretch and do extra squats and side lunges. 

I do wonder, though, when I look up and see the hovering birds of prey in some of the environments: do they swoop in if my score falls?"

The coaches are motivating & help me focus and the app integrates with my watch & tracks everything perfectly.  I’ve still got a ways to go on my fitness journey but I’m so glad I discovered Supernatural!"

They're absolutely amazing. Perfecto! Well done, well done 👏👏"
1456,LemurWYS,"Sep 8, 2021 at 2:10 AM",3,Fun but room for improvement,"I am in the 30 day free trial and I really enjoy it. I am excited to workout for the first time in my life! I feel more like I’m playing a game than working out. However, there are two issues that are making me unsure if I will continue after the free trial ends. 1) as so many people have said, we need a way to mute the trainers during the workout. I understand that the trainers are a big part of the service and that there are complicated agreements in place. However, I have a medical condition that makes it so I can’t process more than one sound at a time. When the trainer talks over the music, I can’t hear either one and I get distracted and lose momentum - I am not getting as much of a workout as I should be. I am also not getting any of the benefits of the trainer because I can’t understand them. So it’s really an accessibility feature in my opinion, and an important one. I am 10000% willing to pay $20/month just for the fun workouts set to music that I like, no trainers needed. 2) let us share accounts across devices somehow! I understand that you don’t want people to exploit the system, but my husband and I have our own oculus headsets. We want to work out at the same time. $20 a month for us to be able to do that is totally worth it, $40 a month is not. I would be happy to prove that we have the same address and are in the same household! So, overall, this is a fun way to get exercise and I want to keep it but I am just not sure if it is worth it based on these two issues. The first one is more important to me, but both are factors."

It doesn’t feel like you’re exercising when you are doing this game and there are coaches to keep you motivated, along with many friends you can get to know through facebook.  You can join or host a party to workout with a group to keep motivated, if you need that.  The SN events groups also hosts competitions every two to three months to help you gain more points and  encourage you along your workout journey to try to push your limits from time to time, but you can always do what feels right for your body and still be a contributing team member during special events.  I started March 2021, and haven’t missed a workout since and almost at 250,000 points in my journey currently.

Then when I did make it, I would just eat snacks from the little store and hide in the locker room like oh im gonna start my workout soon but i never would. I would eat the snacks and go home.

There are a variety of options with  different levels of intensity, a variety of durations, stretching and meditation. The different environments are great. The trainers are fun and supportive, from pushing/challenging to providing guidance on proper form “don’t forget to use your core”.

I no longer dread working out. I will be fitting in these workouts at every moment possible.

Also beatsaber dose not have subscription so it is actually a ton cheaper. Also there is not some lady yelling at you while you play your song you also do not have to downloaded a dang app for beatsaber. So just get beatsaber instead it is so much better than this stuff. Also I think beat saber is more intense so you probably get  a better work out in beatsaber. This game is just a rip off of beatsaber and Not a good one.

# ========================== #

After a month of horrible bugs, Supernatural suddenly started working very well. Of course, I'm still too frustrated to say anything positive. But the objective feedback is that it's fun to smash flying baloons with baseball bats. I do hope it'll contunue to remain stable in the future.

#           Old review : Incredibly buggy.       
# ========================== #

Worked fine for the first few weeks. Then a nightmarish bugfest ensued. 

Issues:
- need to restart the app multiple times before it even loads past the welcome screen.
- asks me to link the game to the oculus app every single time I launch it. Today, I had to do it 5 times. It must be a sick joke because at the same screen it says: ""prepare for the daily dopamine does"". Right. More like a daily hair loss.
- It freezes in random places including: Welcome screen, right after I click on my profile, right before the workout right after the workout. In the middle of the exercises within the same workout.
- The app constantly says: ""Oh, something went wrong"".
- The app constantly says: ""You've lost the Internet"". Spoiler alert: that's not true. every time I get this error, I check the internet and it's there, loading with no issues."
1475,CuteNFriendly,"Oct 28, 2021 at 10:15 AM",3,Scary locations,I enjoy working out on this app but sometimes it’s scary. Just popping up in a new location that is a bit scary throws me off a bit.

1488,Melonious Thunk,"Aug 3, 2021 at 9:42 AM",3,"Great community, mediocre experience","PROS:
- Gorgeous environment
- Thoughtful and effective welcome / onboarding; easy to get started!
- Incredibly supportive, helpful, and non-judgmental Facebook community
- Decent assortment of music, updated often

CONS (at least for me):
- Not much in terms of mechanics variance (squat, hit, lunge, hit, hit hit, squat)
- Timing issues (though I may be alone in this)
- Coaches feel more like life coaches than fitness coaches
- Can't select individual songs, only playlists
- $15-$20/month for the required subscription after the free trial

-----

I'm on a trial, but I'm not enjoying this enough to pay for it.  

Supernatural is clearly an amazing app (and community!) for tons of people; I've literally seen folks' lives transformed. It brings better health and happiness to so many, so I'm glad this app exists! 

But it's not for me.  Here are a few more reasons why.
- The coaching commentaries are entirely pre-recorded, so I'm hearing exactly the same advice and kudos as people 20 years and 20 pounds on either side of me.  And that just feels... useless and insincere. 

I love live fitness classes because the coach knows me.  Pushes ME.  Congratulates me *when I've earned it*.  Corrects me when my form is off.  This *means something* and -- for me -- is truly helpful and motivating.

Lastly, I get just as good of a workout with the game ""Synth Riders."" I choose the songs. No subscription.  No life platitudes. The choreography is FAR more musical... but I still get a great shoulder, arm, core, leg workout! And it even offers multi-player. Only thing missing is SN's gorgeous environments."
1489,Vlkyr,"Aug 11, 2021 at 6:38 AM",1,Too expensive,The hit detection is ever slightly off and the price point is just ridiculous. Lack of feedback and bat model is uninspiring.

1491,SuperBoring2000,"Jul 24, 2021 at 6:13 AM",1,Very disappointed l,"The idea is great - many workouts, real trainers, real results. But the reality is different. The number of workouts is actually not that big if you use the app regularly (I worked out every day for a couple of months). The trainers  will drive you crazy with their talk (which cannot be stopped) after a while, many of the ""premium"" tunes simply suck... I really wanted to use and benefit from this app but for the amount they charge it just makes no sense at all. There are other workout apps where you pay once and you get similar results... If you do not work out regularly - you may not experience the issues I had (limited exercises etc) - but then the price is even less attractive. If they offered this for $5 a month with the ability to switch the trainer talk off - that would make more sense. But that is not the case. So the current high price, limited workouts (limited if you do it for a few months every day), boring trainer talk - it is not worth it... There are many good reviews from people who try this once or twice. I wanted to use this seriously - and for that it just does not work... ."

That’s why I get frustrated with beat saber because I can’t get past certain levels anf the music becomes repetitive. When you’re working out it’s hard to get yourself going if you’re not familiar with the music, so it’s great to not know what’s coming but to recognize some of your favorite hits you haven’t heard in awhile. Trainers keep it fun, not much time to take in the scenery but it’s nice. Would like more targets with the trails so you can plan your moves a little and make more impactful and graceful movements"

1498,Parable,"May 12, 2021 at 2:00 AM",5,Staying on top,"Hey I tried the supernatural trial period. One month really does gives you enough time to make a good sound decision rather or not if you want to decide to go for the subscription  membership or not. I would say that the big difference was to me was the quality of the product and the innovation and time. The graphics are just breathtaking on most of the scenes. I mean you can look in the water and you can see movement. It’s little things like that  along with the sounds goes into getting you into a solid emergence . Some people may bark at the price but come on most people waste far more than that just going out here and there on the street blowing money.  I paid $179 for a whole year!  Which is the better value to just pay and go. If you work out and meditate everyday and sometimes twice a day the cost is more than justified and of a great value! They have hit workouts, stretching and meditation. All under the same umbrella! Now that’s value! 

On a last note to the developers I was thinking about can you add a jog in place scenic trail section? As you jog in place and swing your arms up and down you would move on the jogging trail. Maybe just a few scenic run experiences like running on the beach 🏖 , up a mountain trail, running in a snow cover paradise scene. That would be a nice warm up as well. Or if you want to keep it simple make it that you are on a small island running on a circular track . If you think about it that would be very SUPERNATURAL 👍👍"

1504,EstimatedNate,"May 14, 2021 at 5:38 PM",5,This has changed my life,"Before I do my daily Supernatural session, I wanted to finally drop a quick review after 70 or so sessions into my journey. 

I am in my early 30's and have never once had a gym membership or frankly had any desire to get one. I don't even remember the sequence of events that led me to Supernatural but wow, I am so glad I found it. 

I have abs people, abs! I'm seeing veins and muscles I never knew I had. I feel PUMPED during and after my workouts. I have to moderate myself because sometimes I'll want to keep going but I know I should rest my muscles. 

The self-confidence boost, the self-esteem boost, the amazing endorphin-rush darn good feelings -- I can't thank Supernatural enough. Starting a routine with this amazing, amazing app has changed the way I sleep and eat. I have more energy and I'm am not hampered by worries nearly as much. 

Now I am not saying this app is going to drastically change you for the better. But hey, it might. I know it changed me and I am excited to see what the future holds. It has made being an ""athlete"" something I look forward to -- I never understood why people worked out before their day started, but I sure do now! 

Give it a shot. You have nothing to lose."

I used to do the beachbody programs when I was younger and I could always stay dedicated and lose weight and tone up. I'm 32 now and had been battling with depression and anxiety, the pandemic certainly didn't help and I gained about 70 pounds. I was the biggest I had ever been. Beachbody programs couldn't keep me motivated anymore. Felt like a chore and I'd often talk myself out of it. I purchased an Oculus Quest 2 in January of this year. And as soon as I played this I feel in love. I have never sweated so much in my life! Not even running on the treadmill at PF. I was playing and hours would go by and the whole time I'm doing HIIT, squats, lunges, my shoulders, biceps, triceps, everything would be on fire but I was just having so much fun! It's been 2.5 months and I have lost so many inches off of my body! My husband's noticed along with family and friends. I just added in some weight training at home and I am hooked. My mood has improved and the meditation is also another amazing benefit to this app! The locations, incredible, trainers, epic, the benefits...just insane! I think it's worth $19 a month. I'm actually purchasing it for a year next month. I'm addicted and I'm so happy with how it's making my arms and body look. I'm so much stronger for everyday things and I don't get out of breath.

It's fun, the scenes are lovely, and it's a great workout. But when I compare it to other apps in my collection that get my blood pumping and have one-time purchase costs, is it worth the $19/month? I'm at the end of my 30-day trial and I'm probably going to cancel.

I spend a lot of time in front of a computer, working from home. I find the workouts I get in VR both fun and aerobically challenging. I would rather work out at home than go to a gym. I haven't been much of a gamer for many years, but I can definitely appreciate apps that ""gamify"" exercise. If I did NOT appreciate other games that double as workouts, and/or I simply had to have music of a particularly pop/contemporary flavor, and/or I thrived on being coached through my workout, then Supernatural would have a whole lot more value for me. But using it as an everyday workout gets boring rather quickly, given the variety that's available by rotating in other games. I can see wanting to do maybe 2-3 Supernatural sessions per week.

And there are things about Supernatural that I've come to dislike. I want to turn the coaching off, completely. Having the coaches' personalities in the middle of the music and nature is distracting for me. And I don't feel that the lunge and squat prompts are implemented effectively, in comparison to other apps that use the concept of avoiding oncoming barriers of a particular shape. And the 360 degree photo environments currently can't quite attain the resolution that would make them truly immersive for me.

A more flexible price model is needed. You could take away the coaching, or limit the number of workouts per week, charge $10/month, and keep a whole lot more subscribers--all while still paying the royalties on the commercial music tracks."
1509,Gillian,"Jul 27, 2021 at 7:30 AM",5,A year on and still loving it!,"I've been using Supernatural for 15 months now and I don't regret it at all! I've used at least twice a week this entire time. I was thrilled to find cardio that I don't hate and a workout where I don't feel bored 5 minutes it. I can see a huge difference in the muscle of my thighs and glutes which was a nice reward. And I think it's helped my mental health being able to escape to these gorgeous natural settings after sitting in a cubicle all day especially in the dead of winter.
There's a couple tweaks I'd like but they've adapted the app so much over this past year that I wouldn't be surprised if they eventually happen. It would be nice to filter the playlists more i.e. Rock playlists, difficulty hard, and on My List. And it would be nice if we could create custom playlists containing songs that already exist in their database. Just because sometimes I want to skip to songs that are in the middle of playlists.
It's not the cheapest app but it's by far the longest I've ever consistently worked out and stuck to a workout plan. I still look forward to it even though I'm going to be drenched in sweat by the end so it's been 100% worth it to me!"
1510,Leanne,"Jul 26, 2021 at 10:03 PM",5,AMAZING!!,"Wow! Supernatural is amazing! I started with Beat Saber, cuz that’s the game I tried on my sisters when I first tried out VR. It was so much fun and I knew I would actually exercise with that!! But after a few days, I got kinda bored. So I read all the reviews and decided I’d get Audio Trip next, and then Synth Riders, and then if I still wanted something more, I’d go for Supernatural’s 30 day trial and see if I wanted to actually pay a monthly membership fee! I’ve had Audio Trip for about a week and it’s so fun! I got a way better workout that Beat Saber! There’s a lot more full body movements. And it was fun to mix up triangles and ribbons and drums! What’s pretty cool is you can actually create your own choreography, but I don’t have time for that. I got real bored real quick with their 18 songs. And I was tired of always being inside a dark video game atmosphere. So I skipped buying Synth Riders and went for Supernatural because I really wanted some light and some scenery! And their atmospheres are incredible! But I am so pleased with the exercise instruction and encouragement I get when I play Supernatural! I’m not a big music junky, so I was very pleased with the variety to choose from. I just worked out to a Sweat Symphony playlist and it was incredible! I loved the coach sharing storing while I worked out that really inspired me, both physically and mentally!! And the workout was so good! Tons of squats and lunges and huge full body movements really aimed at working your core! I’m so glad I went for it! I went ahead and subscribed for the whole year cuz I saved $50 and I figured this was the cheapest gym membership I could possibly get and I have personal trainers absolutely anytime I want to work out!! Plus, since they add new content every day, I know I’ll never get bored!! And their sense of community is so welcoming and encouraging versus the competitive atmosphere in the other video game formats. Definitely money well spent if you’re serious about getting fit!"
1511,Josh,"Aug 2, 2021 at 10:39 PM",3,"Two weeks in, still very conflicted","I would normally give something like this 4 stars instead of three, but when you charge as much as they do for the product, it had better be perfect and then some.

The Good:
After 2 weeks, I am down 13 pounds and that is without any change to my diet or anything else in my life. Hands down, this works. The environments are gorgeous! In fact, I often get distracted by them while working out. Workouts are fun and challenging (at least at first...more on this later). The music is generally fun.
Trainers are great and I've learned to pick trainers based on what kind of work out I want. These aren't always true, but here's the trends I've noticed. Raneir does very light and very easy workouts  (he has a BIG personality, so I need to be in the right mood for him). Doc is slightly more challenging. My favorite is Leanne. Workouts with her are full body and challenging, but she has makes me want to push just a little bit further every time. I call Dwana ""leg killer."" Workouts with Mark always leave my shoulders on fire.

The bad:
The price is a hard pill to swallow. I would rather buy one time have the option to pay for more workouts later. 2 weeks in and I already need more challenge, but going from low to medium/high intensity doesn't do it. Medium/high intensity workouts just give more bubbles, way less triangles, and the bubbles no longer flow from one to the next, but rather feature jerky, unnatural movements that caused me to pull a muscle in my back. If I want ""workouts"" like this, I have beat saber. I get less of a workout when I increase ""intensity level."" Some of the hip-hop and rap music they choose is downright vulgar. Most (not all) of these workouts have featured Doc. If you don't know the songs by name, there is no warning and I lose enjoyment immediately.

Verdict:
This would be a good supplement to a gym membership if the price wasn't this high. I will cancel as soon I get back in the gym. I'm not paying for annual."

Worth every single penny.   I was about to go hire a personal trainer to help with my workout routine but decided to give this a try instead.  So glad I did, I have never had so much fun working out.  And I LOVE the coaches, even though everything is in VR, it feels so real and their guidance during the workouts is just as motivating as it would be in person.  Highly recommend!!"
1516,CatsandCoffee,"Aug 19, 2021 at 9:22 PM",4,Pricy,"I got to play the demo and the graphics and locations are amazing and the exercises available on the tutorial seem awesome.

$20/month is currently not in my budget. I don't fault the developer for that, however, I wish there was a one-time purchase option like beat saber with the option to buy add-ons. 

Beat saber cost me around $30-$40 one-time purchase and I can purchase songs/albums as I go.

Overall, this seems like a great app, I just can't justify $20 per month at this time, which is why I chose to buy an oculus over a gym membership to exercise comfortably in my own home. If you can afford it I say go for it!"
1517,Sir CrowZero,"Aug 11, 2021 at 3:13 PM",3,Overall Pretty Good,"The music is great, most of the coaches are fun and or funny.

So some issues I have is sometimes the game crashes in the middle of a game on either headset although rare, it does happen. But what bothers me the most is when I complete a workout and it is headed to cool down and it freezes and I have to reboot the game and my workout isn't saved. If you can allow 1 min or so to allow people to get back into the game in case this stuff happens that would be great. 

Also I would find it much easier to sort by Era and Genre of music, unless it is already there and I missed it. Because there is a ton of stuff on there I have to filter through to see what I like."
1518,Dogman,"Jul 17, 2021 at 10:55 AM",5,"5 stars are not enough, simply the best","I own pretty much all of the apps you could conceivably workout to, many of them pretty good.  But none of them have motivated me to workout as often as Supernatural.  why?

The music is terrific, plentiful with every kind of genre represented.  The instructors are motivating, encouraging and helpful.  The scoring system rewards athletic movement, I break a sweat every time.  The Supernatural community is great.  The scenery is spectacular.  The workouts are varied enough to stave off boredom.

My only regret is not trying Supernatural earlier, due to its relatively expensive subscription.  If you are at all serious about vr fitness, you simply must give the 30 day free trial a spin.  I was skeptical that it would be worth it.

I am now a happy annual subscriber.  Supernatural is now my favorite app.  It is sensational."

No but really though. You know the “I’ve tried everything” trope? I’m the president of the company. I have tried several successful workouts like Insanity, P90x, sadistic trainers, hours on the elliptical....NOTHING makes me sweat like this. And I’be never really been a heavy sweater. AND I’m an endomorph with a sluggish metabolism. 
But I just finished a workout, and I’m sweating bullets. This is day 4 for me and my ridiculously pants are loose.  

Cancel your gym memberships. Buy this instead. Why be in a gym when You can workout in Spain, or Machu Pichu while the coaches are filling your ears with non-cliche, genuine encouragement along with music you actually like, while playing a cracked-out version of Beat Saber, beating the snot out of balloons. Yes. Gimme more. 

All jokes aside. I was in a very dark place before picking this game up, with rapidly deteriorating mental health due to weightgain. Now I look forward to rushing home for my workout. Whaaaaat?! Love you, Supernatural (and Coach Doc)

I really wanted to like Supernatural, the environments look so nice, but I was so disappointed at how easy it was I barely broke a sweat. Buy Beat Saber instead along with the extra music packs, you will burn way more calories and you get to keep it for a lifetime, no subscription needed."

It could be the more-current music that we all love, the coaches cheering you in the background or just the mind-blowing scenery but I can legit get through an hour workout without seeing the time fly. I really enjoyed the free trial. The coaches are all great. 

However I did not purchase a membership, the price is just too high. I appreciate that music rights are expensive but I can't justify paying the price of a gym membership or a netflix subscription, for a cardio workout app that only works a couple of body parts. If it was 5-10$ per month if would be a no brainer. Otherwise, maybe adding different types of exercises could help justify the cost.  Hope my feedback helps.  Keep up the good work!"

I have no clue how to stop this since my subscriptions show none. Be cautious about doing the free trial!"
1534,Shawn,"Jul 15, 2021 at 7:18 AM",4,,"I bought a Quest specifically for exercising several months ago to help me get out of my funk from prolonged teleworking. I used to exercise regularly during my lunch hour at work but COVID threw a wrench in that, especially because there’s only so much you can doin an apartment, causing me to get quite out of shape. Supernatural was one of several games that I tried and I have to say, I’m hooked. It’s a great way to get moving and it’s fun to see the different scenery. The coaches are great, too. I saw some reviews complaining about the cost of the subscription being comparable to a gym membership, but in addition to the music rights I imagine quite a bit of effort goes into creating each workout so I think it’s justifiable.

My one complaint, and the reason why I don’t give this five stars, is that the game tends to be a little bit unstable and do odd things if anything happens with my Quest (such as accidentally knocking the power button when trying to pause to get some water) and there’s unfortunately no way to exit and re-enter a workout without losing all of your progress. It would be really nice if there was a way to pick back up on a given track, or even just record that a partial workout was completed for you stats.

Otherwise, I see myself continuing to play this for a long while. It’s been a long time since I’ve enjoyed myself this much while exercising."
1535,Debbie,"May 1, 2021 at 5:44 PM",5,LOVE. Totally worth subscription fee.,"I spend a LOT of time sitting in front of the computer, am NOT someone who normally enjoys working out, and have tried many different VR fitness apps. Supernatural is my fave by far, and worth the subscription fee for me. Why? Just some of the reasons:

1.  The music. This is a biggie for me, since I find that enjoying the music helps keep my mind off the fact that I'm working out, keeps me coming back. I was excited to hear Billboard's announcement that Supernatural has just signed a deal with Universal Music Group, which means access to even more music. Love the variety of music from a wide range of time periods, and different timely themes as well (e.g. Women's History Month).

2. The scenery. So many VR fitness apps take place indoors, and especially in dark tunnels. Living in a city where we're still under a stay-at-home order (our third during the pandemic) and not being able to travel, access to stunning outdoor environments with open skies, sunshine etc. has helped keep me sane.

3. The coaches. I'm normally NOT a fan of motivational chitchat while I'm working out so anticipated having to turn down the volume of the coach audio (you can do that if you just want the music). However, I was surprised to find out how much I DID enjoy the pep talks, personal anecdotes, encouragement....especially when I was having a bad day. I like that each coach has their own style, so I find that I sometimes pick workouts based on how I'm feeling.

4. The varied length of workouts. On very busy work days, it used to be too easy for me to think ""no time to work out"" BUT with Supernatural, I have no excuses. Better to do a 7-8 minute workout during the day (between online meetings, computer sessions) than NO workout at all. On days when I have more time, I'll sometimes do a couple of longer workouts back to back.

One caution for those who are just starting out in VR fitness, who are like me and don't normally do regular workouts: START SLOW. Place emphasis on form first."

As an active adult now, This is 10x better since it helps with reflex times, full body (core, legs, arms, upper body, and glutes) depending on the coach you choose and the music is excellent! It is not about just beating the song to move to the next, it is about how much effort you put in. Even a little is better than none. 

There are modes for all people, light to hard and even choose how long you want to work out!

It is so much fun and the songs are so addictive! I do not realize how long I am playing because it is so fun and by the time I realize it (usually a couple hours), my whole body is sore and my lungs get a great workout too!"

1542,Project Ether,"Jul 2, 2021 at 9:55 PM",5,Lots of fun but could be even better,"As a child I loved being physically active, and this game is the first thing that has ever put me back in that headspace. I look forward to exercising every day, and on the days when my kids etc keep me from getting a few minutes with this app i really miss it. The workouts are fun and you can choose the activity level and duration that works for you in that moment. Also you can tone down or ramp up the intensity with your own body by swinging the whole arm rather than the wrist etc.  I have never had good time in the gym, waiting for the huge guy to stop hogging the weights,  finding the times when the racketball courts are open, and so on. but i can get a great aerobic workout with supernatural right at home. And at least where i live the monthly fee is way less than the cost of the smelly gym full of rude dudes and... well... covid.
There's a good variety of music. I'm in my 40s and can find a lot of familiar stuff as well as discover new tracks. I like a lot of the coaches, who all seem to have different styles- some coac hes and their tracks/routines are more ""dancy"" while others are simpler power movements. I also appreciate what they've released for black history month and that their coaches are diverse in ethnicity, gender, and sexuality.

So now for the criticisms
I only know one other person with VR, and he does not have this app, so one huge side of the screen, the ""leaderboard"" is empty. Why can't I see my standings among users in general, or others in my area, or AT LEAST with my partner who also uses the app under the same subscription but a different account. 
Also, it seems like you can see some of your stats, but only if you have it hooked up to a watch that measures BP etc. I'd really love to see my own statistics like use over time or improvement in accuracy, or even how many times I've done certain routines.
Speaking of doing routines more than once, I have to echo other reviewers in that there needs to be a way to mute the coaches. I like them generally,  but hearing he same thing over and over seems like a ""price"" for repeating beloved routines rather than a good thing. And there are a couple who i don't like and don't want to have to listen to. Now i just skip their routines but if i could mute them I'd try their exercises more often.
Other great additions would be the ability to restart a workout (for those times when I'm interrupted and can't get back for 15 minutes) rather than having to quit and search to find the routine again before restarting. Also an improved search function so you can search for a workout of medium intensity AND short duration, or other multiple things at a time. Now you can set it to look for medium workouts but then setting the duration or coach or any other field resets the first one.
One last thing... what are we supposed to do about the wet sweaty mask liner?  Someone needs to design a workout liner that you can remove and wash.
Thanks for a great app!"

Until one day I played the demo for this game and realized I could actually work up a sweat.  I had become lethargic and unmotivated during the pandemic and after a few days of daily play I gained my energy back.  Having the coaches on screen and talking to you helped keep me motivated.  The beautiful scenery made me feel as if I were there.  It improved both my mental and physical well being.  What I specifically like about the workouts is that it uses the full motion of your arms and body and the coaches encourage it.  It gets the blood flowing without the feel of stress on your joints that some other types of workouts can cause.  I like to play the high intensity workouts and it would be nice if they can come up with more moves focused on core and legs.

1550,Adrienne,"Jun 27, 2021 at 7:53 PM",5,A Million Times Better than FitXR,"I decided to try Supernatural after being ripped off by FitXR or whatever they’re calling themselves this week. Holy shhh  it’s so much better! FitXR is straight up garbage compared to this app.  The music in Supernatural is amazing. Real hit music from artists that you’ve heard of, not the royalty free stock crappy music that FitXR uses. Supernatural has real trainers instead of janky, low budget avatars. The trainers in FitXR give no real instruction, they just scream “new points level!” every few minutes. Supernatural’s trainers actually provide you with tips on proper formation and they are very motivating. 

I saw a lot of reviews that say Supernatural is the same as Beat Saber. I disagree. There’s a much bigger range of motion in Supernatural and the music is much better.

Supernatural is kind of expensive, but I highly recommend it if you can swing it. It’s worth the cost, unlike FitXR."

I struggle with maintaining a healthy lifestyle due to my work schedule, despite being very conscious about it. When I was quite down and depressed, I found Supernatural and the awesome community of coaches and users. Even though we only know each other virtually, it is an amazing, supportive, and inclusive community. It is more than just a workout, especially when everyone is struggling with the pandemic and its consequences. Try it. See if it is for you too :)"

Been using supernatural since January. I lost 20, toned and living a new life. Watched on fb people losing so much weight, getting fit and regaining their lives.  Coaches are caring, enjoyable, make you laugh and push you with positivity.  They treat you like everyone’s journey is worth it.  Life changing experience. Thank you 🙏🏼"
1558,Nope,"Jun 24, 2021 at 2:20 AM",5,More than a Rythum Game,"This is more than just a rhythm game. This app focuses on getting you moving and giving you a balanced workout (including warm ups and cool downs). 

The trainers are fun and interesting. They all put their own style in the workout. They are constantly uploading new workouts and there's something for everyone. 

Definitely check out the streches and the 'you' meditations, which transports you to breath-taking places. I also love the guided meditations, especially when I just need a few minutes to re-center and remember what's important."
1559,WutParadox,"Jun 22, 2021 at 4:00 PM",2,Some concerns for a good game,"This is a great workout game with a thriving community who loves it. The biggest issue is your lack of actually listening to the community in the community forum. There are multiple posts daily on the workouts freezing mid workout. People want to resume at the spot it froze. This dates back to the a year ago when SN came out. Users still have to start over in order to do that specific workout.  Users have been asking also for a skip song/repeat song feature repeatedly. While these are simple to implement for some reason SN doesn't respond. A generic reply to the repeated posts and then each thread is closed. 

If you're thinking of getting SN you should be aware of 1) repetitive reused music in workouts that you cannot skip over. 2) freezes mid workout - you cannot pick up where you left off 3) no skip song/repeat song/select song feature. 


It's pretty dissapointing you'd charge a high monthly cost and ignore such a large user base for so long asking for simple changes."

This workout is AMAZING!! So stress reliving! I love choices of 8min workouts all the way up to 45 min workouts. I can stack several small workouts if I want a variety of music. ITS SERIOUSLY FOR EVERYONE at any fitness was level! And, It is sooooooo fun!! I love all the beautiful scenery paired with great music and fun coaches. I even quite enjoy the mediation options because these locations are just STUNNING. I am seriously addicted!!! I got the occulus thinking if I only used it 2-3 times a week it would be worth it... But I am doing 2-3 workouts a day (one Saturday I did 15 workouts and couldn't barely walk the next day lol I just can't stop because it is seriously that much fun!!) This is not a paid review: I have never had so much fun sweating so dang much!! 💦💦💦

For the developers:

1. Please give the option to create multiple lists ( maybe three lists yellow, red, green flags?) So that within my saved list I can separate and create my own playlists.

2. Lastly, Would love it if we could do multiplayer! I'd like to workout with my sister sometime 🙂 we both play this game separately and love it! 

All together- great product!!!! Highly recommend to anyone!!"
1563,Teresa,"Mar 14, 2021 at 6:34 AM",5,Favorite Workout App,"It’s awesome. I plan to subscribe. Some thoughts:

BEAT SABER. Yes, it’s like Beat Saber in that you use sticks to hit shapes with music playing. But, THAT’S IT. Beat Saber is more like learning to play drums. Supernatural is like getting a full body workout. The motion and movement in Supernatural is different and is made to get your heart rate going. And, it does. Not only that, but the variety of scenery provides a *much* different experience. It’s beautiful. Nature is very healing, and Supernatural has managed to build that into this wonderfully. I look forward to playing because it feels amazing to workout on a mountain top or near the beach, etc. I love Beat Saber, but I don’t get nearly as much of a workout from it & the scenery doesn’t even compare. 

- FIT XR: I have it and love it. Buuuut, I got bored with it. It’s the same two environments, the coaches don’t seem like real people. They don’t give actual advice. The music in it is often not energetic enough to give me energy. I think Supernatural offers a lot more. 

-COACHES: I *love* the coaches. They come across as real people with real advice and they can be pretty entertaining and/or encouraging. I think they’re a great addition to the game. I haven’t tried it, but in settings, there’s the option to turn their volume completely down if they’re not your thing. Seems like it might mute them that way?

- MONTHLY FEE: I used to pay $40 a month for a gym membership, and I get a better workout with Supernatural. I’m happy to pay $15-20 a month & think it’s more than worth it. It’s worth it to me to get the variety of workouts, new stuff to keep it interesting, the variety of coaches to choose from, and access to meditation sessions too. (I love those!) There are real people on the other side of this that put a lot of work into keeping this new and fresh, with *daily* additions, and I’m happy to pay for that work. 

Supernatural has done an amazing job with this! Thank you so much to all of those involved. It really brightens my day, and I look forward to playing each time."
1564,David,"Jun 24, 2021 at 7:47 PM",4,This is NOT a Beat Saber competitor,"I did the free trial, and had an amazing month. After it was over, I cancelled my subscription because it’s expensive. I thought I could replace it with Beat Saber, Synth Riders, and other “fitness” games. However, after several weeks without it, something was missing. The beautiful environments, the awesome music, the encouraging coaches who guide you through stretches and help you work on your form while hitting the targets. It’s really a full-body workout and not a game. 

Beat Saber is a game. It’s about completing levels. Supernatural is a workout. If you miss targets, it’s fine, that’s not the goal. It’s full-body and gets you to squat a lot, work on your core, etc. It’s about using the correct form to get the best result, whereas BS rewards using wrong form by flicking your wrists to hit difficult targets. 

I would give Supernatural 5 stars, but I have to dock -1 star because it’s expensive. I didn’t want to sign up again for this reason, but I feel like I need it since it fills a hole that no other game currently does. Also, I don’t care for the political “PRIDE”-pushing in the game with some of the playlists. Just give me great songs and a great experience and leave that stuff out. Thanks!"

The coaches are incredible—hilarious and motivating (looking at you Raneir Pollard!), the scenery is wonderful, but the best part is the music selection. Beat saber is great too but it doesn’t have the extensive music library of supernatural, all genres. I’ve played 11 times in two weeks and can’t wait to hop on it again (although my thighs are telling me to wait a day or two). 

Supernatural - y’all should do in-person events with your coaches! Would love an in person workout with some of these great people."

1571,greygollum,"Jun 15, 2021 at 1:21 PM",5,Pretty amazing workouts for all levels.,"I'm surprised that it is this good.  While it uses some similar mechanics to Beat Sabre, it really makes use of them to get a full body workout. It gets your heart rate up,  gets you sweating,  and you will feel it afterwards.  If the workout gets to intense you can pause it for a breather or exit it to select an easier workout.  
The sessions are searchable by music, intensity , trainer,  as well as stretching and meditation sessions. 
The personal trainers walk you through the mechanics in the beginning of the earlier workouts and encourage you through the whole session. While there aren't any annoying trainers, you will definitely find a favorite. 
There is a subscription, but its cheaper than a gym membership or a personal trainer.  Very much worth the monthly fee."
1572,Budrcup,"May 7, 2021 at 4:09 PM",1,"BEWARE, NO REFUND/NO RESPONSE STILL!!!",I tried to cancel before the trail period ended but they changed my account for an entire year anyway.

Its a lot of fun and motivating. If it was a flat fee for the game, I'd be first in line, however NOTHING about this game is worth the subscription fee. I end up playing the same favorite workouts because there isn't enough variety. They add new workouts but they are just too similar to ones already out. You can't mute the trainers which get annoying when you've already heard their banter 5 times and I hate when they sing along to the music. No thank you. This style of monthly fee is ridiculous and not at all worth it even for such a wonderful game so it gets a 3 (5 for the game and 1 for the cost)"
1574,Dmovs,"May 21, 2021 at 2:43 PM",5,Super Wonderful,"40 year old male. I've lost 32 lbs in 2.5 months (also tracking calories in Fitbit). The only thing I do for fitness is this app, neighborhood walks, and once a week some simple weights.

Working out is fun now.

I find it difficult to stick with a workout unless It's playing on a team sport. Running gets boring, the gym gets boring, home workouts get boring.

But with this app, I workout 6 days a week and I want to workout the 7th day but I make myself rest.

My wife said that even before we were married, I was not this fit.

I also love the meditations in this app. The settings/locations are beautiful and I can easily get centered meditating, for example, at a beach in Norway.

I am so glad I started a free 30 day trial. I just went ahead and switched to annual membership.

I look back at pictures of myself on the beach just a year ago and I don't even recognize myself. I'm not only lean now, I have definition, good muscle.

I love this app."

1576,Trevor,"May 9, 2021 at 12:43 AM",5,I’ve never wanted to work out more...,"Supernatural is truly an amazing experience. I’ve been eyeing it ever since I got my quest and I’m so glad I tried the one month trial. Supernatural gets you moving in ways I didn’t think I could in a fitness environment. The gameplay is similar to BeatSaber, but unlike BeatSaber, Supernatural is all about getting you to move. The coaches encourage you to move your entire body, not just your wrists. If you are anything like me and have always wanted to work out but never had the time or encouragement, I say go for it! :)"
1577,Nickleen,"May 9, 2021 at 6:10 AM",5,Total game changer!,"I downloaded this 2 days after my 42nd birthday. I’d never worked out in my life. I have a very physically demanding job so I’ve managed to stay in somewhat decent shape but this is definitely the year to start putting my health first. To say this app is life changing is an understatement. I’ve now worked out every single day for 5 months. I’ve dropped 15 pounds and feel better than I did at 20! 
The music is awesome and with new daily workouts, there’s something for everyone. That’s what drew me to the app in the first place and one of the reasons I keep coming back. However, the coaches are the ones who get me excited to sweat my butt off! When I started, I was a bit hesitant because I couldn’t completely mute them. I’ve dealt with a ton of coaches in the past as well as other professionals who use a lot of canned dialog. It all sounds so fake and tends to have the opposite effect on getting me motivated for anything. That’s totally not the case here. These coaches are given the freedom to express their real personalities and share stories that are important to them. I really feel like I have a connection with each of them. I feel accountable to them.  This is HUGE!"
1578,RaGeo,"Jun 12, 2021 at 4:42 AM",5,I don’t even feel like I’m working out..,"I subscribed to this app when my regular closed due to the pandemic, so I didn’t mind replacing my regular monthly gym membership with this app. Every time I work out, it simply feels like I’m playing a game. There are so many aspects to getting a higher score that I’m always challenged, even when I repeat a workout. I can always swing the bats a little harder or sit a little deeper into the squats. They offer a nice variety of soundtracks that I can always find something to fit my mood. I appreciate the different personalities of the trainers, and they always seem to know when to offer that little extra bit of encouragement to make me give just a bit more.

If I feel like getting outside to switch up my workout, it’s nice to be able to come back inside to Supernatural for a stretch or a session of mindfulness meditation. It has the option to adjust the squat and lunge height, and even offers the option to omit squats completely if that’s not your thing. The scenery is stunning, and traveling to other planets is a nice addition! They’ve also built a nice community of users who support each other and compete against each other to keep us motivated through the companion app. It’s all I could ask for in a fitness app!"
1579,Tolbert,"May 2, 2021 at 7:30 AM",1,Its just a bad copy of beatsaber,"This app is just a bad copy of beat saber, i tried the app because my mom who also has an oculus told me about how people got “such a good workout” out of this. All this game is is moving your bats around and hitting obstacles with the same color, and in the direction it says, sound familiar? And with beat saber, it is a one time purchase, while supernatural is a monthly purchase. “Oh but supernatural makes you do squats” try burning sands on expert. This is all coming from a 12 year old. Dont waste your money on supernatural, buy beatsaber instead."

1582,rjaxon7525,"Jun 30, 2021 at 11:48 PM",4,Almost a Perfect Product!,"Let me start by saying giving a huge shout out to the development team for putting together a super high-quality product that is both fun to use and visually stunning!

The Instructors are fabulous. ALL of them! Each of them have a distinctive style & personality and that really made it fun to pick a style of workout each day. The real game-changer was being able to see & hear them (no cheesy 3D avatars!). THIS is the best part of this product!

The Music is on-point! LOVE the variety of music from ALL genres (Classical? Check! Hip-Hop? Check! Country? Check! etc.). The Instructors do a wonderful job of customizing their routines to the style of music and that is a HUGE deal when working out. Excellent job on this!

The Artwork is clean, clear & elegant! A lot of apps blow it on their UI/UX design but this team did a really good job of keeping things simple, easy to understand and easy to navigate. It often goes unnoticed but truly excellent UI/UX showcases the CONTENT and minimizes customer frustration so REALLY NICE JOB team!

Having said that....its the Nature Photography that steals the show! You simply can't get better than working out in Brazil or any of the other fabulous locations. The subtle motion graphics on water and other elements also adds to the beauty of the scene. 

All-in-All...this is an EXCELLENT product and one I highly recommend for at-home workouts. I only have 1 suggestions for improving this product: 

You Should Offer a few Levels for Subscriptions - the current price offering is priced the same as gym memberships. Unfortunately,  the app doesn't offer the same level of workout options so the VALUE isn't aligned with the PRICE. Some people will replace their gym memberships with this app...others, won't. Offering a lower-priced option will make it worth-while for users to keep BOTH options rather than choosing one over the other. 

KUDOS to everyone that worked on this product!"
1583,Rosieredhead,"Jun 30, 2021 at 6:50 PM",4,Fun and Motivating,"This is probably my favourite app/game for the oculus quest 2. It has coaching, which I actually appreciate the motivation and reminders for proper form, there are so many different genres of music, and 4 different levels of intensity. You can also choose meditation or stretching. There are leader boards and a great community on Facebook, where the coaches actually interact with the people. There is a brand new workout every day. My cons list is short... Firstly, it's advertised as $19.00 per month. It's the only app that's advertised in US dollars, so you can imagine my surprise when it actually cost me 24.03 Canadian dollars. I appreciate the cost involved in maintaining this app, but it's definitely on the high end. I don't want to pay for for the full year in advance, as I've seen some people getting hurt, sick, etc. Then not being able to use it at all.  I also appreciate the workouts all flow together, but often, I only like one or two songs in the list. If I don't care for the song I don't do as well, and I don't enjoy it. I pick several workouts and string them together anyway, but I would like to be able to just pick from my list of favourite songs and make my own workout.
Overall, I definitely recommend, especially since you get 30 days free trial. Honestly. I'm not sure paying for it every month will be sustainanle for me. I'm already Nickled and dimed to death in monthly bills."
1584,Flo,"Jun 17, 2021 at 7:15 AM",5,Genius!,"This app is truly amazing as it allows people (couch potatoes) to actually enjoy working out  most every day of the week. I'm one of them.

1585,chuwy,"Jul 1, 2021 at 9:18 AM",5,Great app,So I was not sure at first. Yes I think it should be cheaper. But it's a 24 hour gym and you get good music with someone  Encouraging you. So far my favorites are coach Dwana and coach Doc
1586,Bad Hombre,"May 28, 2021 at 2:37 AM",1,Did not like the workout nor the cost,"I gave this app about 15 minutes and bailed.  After the first intro its all downhill from there.  I want a workout that fun and I want to challenge my body, not my beat saber skills.

The sign up process was obnoxious.  You are forced to provide a credit card and you have to leave the game to do this on the required app.  I think a phone thus is required.

Too heavy on the game aspect to the point where I am more worried about hitting the correct color in the correct way than I am with pushing myself.

The music was good but I guess that’s why it has an astronomical price.

The environments are cool but get boring quickly and dont really add much.  Also the video recorded instructors only appear briefly.

I get a better workout with Thrill of the Fight, FitXR and Creed.  This game really is the same as best saber.  Side load quality music with good mappings and you have Supernatural.

$20 a month is a laughable amount to pay for a VIDEO GAMES.   The pandemic is over and Ill stick to my local gym with some TotF mixed in.  I bought FitXR before they stupidly changed to subscription so Im good there."

1588,PainTitan,"May 22, 2021 at 9:19 PM",1,Subscription based fails,"As someone who doesn't have money to spend on monthly subscriptions I think this model of content is stupid and bad for the community. There should be a base game free or paid for that offers content that you can access because you have the app license. Dlc you can buy secondarily. A subscription you could choose to take part in but not be forced into. 

Idk why they can't offer base game content like beat saber, pistol whip, star wars pinball. No one's interested in spending 100-300 dollars after a couple years and having nothing to go back to and play. Garbage."
1589,Heyboova,"May 24, 2021 at 4:41 AM",3,"Good, but needs a non sub option","Played this a lot during my trial period and was pleasantly surprised. 
Pros: 
-environments are amazing and my favorite part of the game. 
-soundtrack is great 
-Good workout 
-Fun effects hitting the balloons

Negatives:
-While I do understand the subscription price is the reason they are able to keep a quality soundtrack in rotation, I wish there were tiers or some other option to play the game without it costing so much. 
-Do not care about the trainers. Would prefer to have the option to remove this completely and frustratingly knowing they are part of the reason the price is high. 
-while it’s still pretty fun, it’s more basic than other music games which may be a positive or negative for you. 

Lastly, not a negative or positive, but a lot of the workout seems to come from frequent squatting. If this is difficult for you then it’s going to take away some of the game. My leg was sore for a while and made it hard to use the game to it’s full potential. 

If you are going to use this to replace a gym membership I think it is worth it. As a game, it’s frustrating so many are going to a subscription model."
1590,kythuen,"Jun 9, 2021 at 2:58 AM",5,Such a great workout,"I love this. I'm officially An Old, and I've never really been able to get into working out. All the advice out there says to find an exercise you really enjoy/look forward to doing, and you can make exercising a habit - but I had never found anything I really enjoyed enough to keep up with. This app has me coming back every day - sometimes when I really shouldn't, like when I did two workouts the day before and really need a rest day! 

I only have two suggestions:

1) More, and more varied, workout environments. The intro on Mars is fantastic, I'd love to see more like that - let's work out on Venus! Titan! Saturn!  There's so much potential and no limits, I'd really like to work out in some alien environments, or maybe fantasy environments, just add more imaginary or other-worldly elements to the workout space. 

2) Expand the music library -  add more 70's/80's/90's pop and rock, it seems like there's a real gap in the musical experience here. Can we get some NSYNC, Madonna, TOTO, Cyndi Lauper, Heart, Journey, Kansas, ACDC, that kind of thing - stuff you'd hear on the radio, not all B-sides. (Got a friend who calls this 80's Skating Rink music, but hey, it had a beat you could skate to, I bet you could beat up balloons to it, too!)

Still, I love it as-is, and I'm on board for the annual subscription, I think it's totally worth it."
1591,Roxy,"Jun 4, 2021 at 11:01 AM",5,"Great app, even if you hate working out!","Update: I did decide to go ahead and do the year subscription. I just don't think I could get through the week without coaches Raneir and Doc cheering me on through a workout. But still waiting for artist and song search options and a way to request a new song through the request form for a specific complexity level. 

_____________________________________

I will preface this by saying I'm one of the laziest people I know. I hate working out! I had lost 45 lbs before the pandemic and I have gained about 26 back over the last year. Several people on Facebook mentioned the Oculus, and a couple of them said they only ever use it for Supernatural. I felt crazy buying a VR just for workout apps but I figured, what the heck, you only live once. I was afraid it would be a waste but this app is freaking ridiculous. I've only been doing it a week but I actually find it fun trying to keep my power and accuracy percentages up, and I like the variations in music, complexity, and duration. I've also lost a few pounds already so that was encouraging. 

I was disappointed there was no song or artist search, but I figured out a work around through the mobile app by just narrowing down my search and going through all the workouts until I found all the ones I would like to listen to. Hopefully they add an artist search in the future. But I do appreciate the song request form!

One of the best things has been customer support. I am sure I annoyed the Crap out of Michael D with all my emails, but he was so patient and nice so a big shout out for him! I'm going to do one month after my 30 days is over and then if it keeps going this well I will probably just switch to the annual subscription."
1592,Sadok,"May 9, 2021 at 9:19 PM",4,Amazing - just way too expensive. Shame,"Such a great app and experience. But I really do feel like the developer is charging way too high a monthly fee for an oculus game and that really shouldn’t. The coaching and guiding aren’t really coaching and guiding, it’s just a nice motivational boost. I would totally keep this app if it were like $10-$15 / month max. But $20 is basically what I pay for my gym membership. I’ve purchased entire oculus games for $25 that I haven’t put down since but $20 per month is an arm and a leg"

Supernatural has not only helped me improve my overall fitness level, but it has also helped me get through depression and anxiety resulting from the pandemic.

1594,Corvus,"Jun 3, 2021 at 6:16 AM",5,Can't Believe How FUN It Is!,"I hate working out. I mean I really, truly, hate working out. What’s cool about Supernatural is that it combines physical activity that works muscles all over your body with beautiful locations and really sweet playlists. I’ve only been using the program for a week and a half, but so far I have ENJOYED every workout I’ve done. Unlike going to a gym or using some other video workout program, you’re fully immersed in beautiful places, moving with the music, squatting, lunging, and striking your targets with full range of motion. I had no idea I would enjoy this anywhere near as much as I do.

This is not a Beat Saber knock off, either. As much as I love Beat Saber, it doesn’t work my core or my legs anywhere near as much as Supernatural does. The focus of effort is almost entirely in the upper body. Don’t get me wrong, you can and will work up a sweat with Beat Saber, but this is a much more complete workout for your entire body.

I also really like the coaches. I’ve had personal trainers in the past, and the way the coaches in Supernatural provide encouragement and positive reinforcement of what you’re trying to achieve is an awesome component in the program.

I would give this 10 stars if I could."
1595,Meredith,"Apr 25, 2021 at 3:02 AM",5,Sets the standard for VR workout apps,"Pretty much exactly what the title says, this is by far the best VR workout app out there. The workouts are perfect, the instructors are perfect, the UI is perfect, the variety of content is perfect. Basically if the developers keep this up they're going to put ever other VR workout app out of business. The subscription model and pricing is completely appropriate for the cadence of new content and the overall level of polish (I don't think I've ever seen a buggy update and as someone who works in video games, that's really impressive). I don't think I will ever stop using this for my workouts seriously A+, slam dunk, high fives!!"
1596,clee1188,"May 22, 2021 at 7:17 PM",4,Great Cardio Workout,"This is a really great cardio workout and it will definitely get you sweating. It’s not a bad deal if you don’t have another gym membership or another workout subscription but subscriptions can add up so it’s really about preference. If you mainly weight/strength train and want some type of cardio on the side, not sure the price is worth it. But if you plan to primarily do cardio, this is a great option for you. I like that they use songs that you know. It makes it easier to workout to the beat of the song and makes the workout more fun. 

Some feedback and things I hope could be updated:

1. Better filter functionality - right now you can only really filter one thing at a time. If I want a short workout with pop music then you have to either filter for pop music and scroll through to find a short workout or vice versa. I want to be able to filter for a short workout with pop music and even be able to filter for a specific coach. You should be able to filter down using every filter together. Same goes for “My List”. If I filter for just “My List” workouts then I can’t filter anything else.

2. Different options for exercise space - you need a good amount of space in order to do any of the workouts since you’re spinning around in a circle for most of the workouts. Some people don’t have that much clear space to workout. It would be good to have maybe a half space option where the platform is only a semi-circle and you only workout in a 180 degree range as opposed to a 360 range. 

3. Option to limit squats and lunges - this is something that they have in FitXR and it’s great for days when I just did a leg workout and want a bit of cardio afterwards. There’s no way to tell which workouts are lunge/squat heavy. 

4. Ability to pause membership - this is more of a nice to have since I know it won’t be the best in a business/financial aspect but it would be great to pause your membership for when you’re away on a trip for an extended time or can’t workout for a while, maybe due to an injury or something. I guess you can always cancel your membership and then renew but it would be good to have a pause option. Obviously it would have to be done in a way where people don’t take advantage of it. Maybe limit the duration and frequency. Or have the option be there but you need to contact support. 

Overall, I’ve only used the app maybe 10 times but have really enjoyed using it!"

1600,Catalpha,"May 29, 2021 at 4:06 AM",5,Great replacement for my lame local gym,"I thought I'd hate the virtual coaching but I actually like it (I have my favorites - try them all!) - they are GREAT coaches that I'd never get access to at my local gym. I was at 24hr fitness, but disliked the crowding, the smell, and let's face it I am more introverted at a big gym. The travel time to the gym was always discouraging. But now - I LOVE this workout. I track it on my apple watch and it IS working. I do it whenever I have a moment, several times a day. And maybe in the future when I'm ready, I might add in a gym visit on top of this, but this has opened me up to new ways of fitness and I feel happier. I did the free trial, and  It was an easy choice to subscribe.  Thank you Supernatural team - you have improved my fitness routine 100x over!  Yay for virtual coaches (never thought I'd say that)!"
1601,JulieMay64,"May 29, 2021 at 3:56 AM",5,Motivation to work out,"I'm really enjoying this app.  I find the fact that I've paid for it to be a motivating factor (like a gym membership).  However, I do feel the price is a bit high.  Maybe have two tiers - one for single members at more like $10/mo, and one for family with multiple accounts at the current price.  Please please please add yoga with the same levels (H-M-L) and the differences are the length of time a pose is held or how challenging the pose is in the first place.  Use the controllers and the sensors in the head unit for positioning, and maybe have add-on sensors for sale for strapping on to ankles for foot positions.  I can see these being useful now as well, to see if you're making it through the triangles properly - and speaking of that ... is the head sensor even checking for this?   If not, it should.  I also feel like the ""grading"" is maybe too easy.  The workouts on M level are just about right for my ability.  I can't keep up on H.  But, the grading still gives me Platinum + on M and Gold on H.  I know I'm not doing that good!  I'd rather see more realistic grading instead of what I feel is just fluff.  Can Leanne please stop using the term ""athlete""?   I'm not an athlete.  Generally speaking it seems the female coaches talk too much.  I am a female and their constant chatter is unwelcome.  It seems most of the coaches tend to assume that workouts are done in the morning and call the workout a great start to your day.  That should be changed to something more generic.  I generally workout in the afternoon or early evening.  I would also like to see the option to download some of the workouts and store them for offline use.   I bought my Oculus specifically because I can take it places with me (no need for a connected PC).  Sometimes, those places don't have internet.  And, one last thing from someone that is a bit infatuated with symmetry - if we do something on one side like a lunge or rotate in one direction, then we need to do the same thing on the other sid"

I bought my oculus this morning and just completed my first workout on supernatural and I love it. I will probably purchase the year subscription if my back holds up during the 30 day trial. I highly recommend this app. My body feels like I worked out but I actually feel like I got that dopamine burst. I can't wait to try another workout, this was so good."
1603,The Quest...ion,"Feb 5, 2021 at 8:30 PM",4,Really Fun but $20mo is Too Much,"So far I'm really enjoying the workouts.  The scenery is beautiful and I understand that's part of what you pay for. But let's be honest, although this is a large initial fee, the scenes are then used in multiple workouts so it's not an ongoing cost. The other cost the developers refer to are the trainers that ""guide"" you through the workouts. I'd use the term ""guide"" loosely because the warm up and cool down are a couple of minutes long and can be used for any of the workouts, and most of the talking during the workouts has nothing to do with the workout. It's canned motivational speech telling you how great it is that you showed up or comments about the songs with the occasional ""get low into these triangles"" and ""keep those arms straight"" ,thrown in. To be honest after the first week, I (like many people) think the trainers are more of a distraction and annoyance than anything else. Admittedly some are more annoying than others.  I really, really want to be able to mute them, not just turn them down. If the workout for the day is not something you want to do then you have to go back in to a previous workout and hear the same thing all over again. Ugh! Make it stop! I haven't decided yet if I will continue after the 30 days at the $20 price point. Probably not but I may consider it, only if they add a mute button."

I also enjoy having the coaches talking in the background it adds to the experience. I started with beat Saber and got bored of it as it was just me and not really a workout. With the coaches there in your ear giving advice and encouragement helps me at least.
1607,MGriz,"Jun 17, 2021 at 8:28 PM",4,Amazing workout,"I am 57 yrs old and used to run.  For one reason or another I don’t run so much.  During lockdown I needed to do something!

I bought my oculus and was looking for a decent workout app.   I tried out Supernatural thinking it would be “ok”, better than nothing.  Was I wrong!  This is a truly amazing workout (taking into consideration it’s VR).  I planned to workout 3 times a week but find myself doing it almost every day.

The workouts are great; music is awesome and the instructors very motivating.  Scenery is spectacular.

My kids told me I should try meditation a while ago.  I now find myself using the meditation portions of Supernatural on a regular basis too.

My wife is not really into this type of tech but has tried the workouts and is is very impressed.  Being able to have 4 accounts is really a great benefit.

Kudos to all at Supernatural for this awesome app.

I hope that we will soon be able to download favorite workouts so one doesn’t have to rely on WiFi- I spend a bit of time where WiFi is less than reliable and would like to be able to workout when not home."

Overall I like it, it's much more interesting than any other kinds of cardio workouts I ever tried. Though I noticed there seems a higher rate of crushing over the weeks. I can crush between sets and sometimes in the middle of swinging. It crushed nearly the end one time I played the 49 minutes workout and it was not logged into my journey for sure. Hope the issues be addressed, at least save the numbers after sets instead of the full workout."

Most of my day I'm sedimentary due to my desk job. With this awesome VR world, I am literally transported away from reality into a new reality where I can travel and be places one normally couldn't be. My emotions become happy because of the beautiful surroundings and the challenging games MAKE me want to take breaks just to exercise thru each day. 

I KNOW i'll be losing weight and this is only my first day of my premium subscription. I'm so excited as I'm someone who really didn't like creeps looking at me at the gym or other women judging me. So being able to sit at my desk, get up in 10 seconds and throw on my VR to have a 20 minute workout is incredible and sit right back down for work again! I'm in love and so thankful for this technology! I can't wait to see what else VR can do for us.

I think the 20 dollars a month is fair considering you get premium music and a gym is just as much. You get convenience and flexibility and 24 hour use."

Before it just stoped working for a few days I thought this app was amazing. Loved the backgrounds and makes working out really fun. I wish they organized the app better though into more specific categories for types of workouts and mixed up the muscle groups not just the speed and intesity. 

It would be cool if there was a mode where you didn’t have to use the bats the whole time and used your hand for push ups or Something like that."

*I just had one of my best workouts from the (H) Rock Workout that was released on May 21st by Dwana Olson. It was because it had the best song playlist so far with bands included like Pantera, Deftones, and Rob Zombie. So thank you for that. lt pumped me up to complete the class. If Rock playlists in the future continue to have these types of bands, then I will be renewing my subscription and giving Supernatural an even higher score. I only hope they do add newer popular bands like Spiritbox, Jinjer, and Falling in Reverse at some point as well. I will be reporting back.*


Imagine spending a monthly fee for the worst workout music in VR while also being the most expensive. I just tried to workout to another playlist for rock that consisted of tracks for unpopular Fleetwood Mac tracks. How can you justify having an instructor throwing up the rock sign and saying lets get ready to slay while working out to some slow obscure Fleetwood Mac songs that probably the bands were high while recording and shouldn't of even been released. Is there a specific audience you are trying to target here or is the company too cheap to pay for licensing fees? Here is some suggestions for some new ""hip"" female leads (which toes your companies PC lines) for rock bands that you could pay for to help pump people up to want to exercise using your App. Two examples are  the bands Jinjer and Spiritbox. Your playlist just put me to sleep, why I am paying for this again?"

After my first workout, I signed up for the yearly membership because I loved it that much. I’m not a dummy, I put a reminder in my phone for 2 days before the free subscription would end, just in case I changed my mind. When that reminder came up, I had no question in my mind that I want to keep doing this for a long time to come. 

I’m 59 and joined WW about 3 weeks before I started Supernatural. The combination of the two makes me hopeful that I will finally get to my health goals. I feel so much better and can’t believe the endurance I have gained in such a short time. 

Others have said that this subscription is too expensive and I understand that might be an issue, but I think the cost is well worth it. There are new workouts EVERY DAY!!! The other fitness apps I looked at make you pay for the program and then pay more for additional content. I’m not saying one way or the other is better, rather you get what you pay for. 

This is one of only two times I have found an exercise that I love doing and it is the only thing that I can take with me and do wherever I can carve out just a little floor space."

I read comments ahead of time and for me, I don't mind the trainers at all, I don't mind the cost because I would spend it somewhere else and lets be realistic, it is necessary for this company in order to be able to sustain and build on the experience.   I think that is fair.  

The trainers are positive and I find some of the comments they make add some personal touches to an experience that is digital.  I like the words that motivate during the sessions, for me they keep me going and I can complete a workout with some kind of inner confidence that I am trying.  Start slow, build your strength and endurance. You can't be a pro athlete right out of the gate, so if you aren't athletically inclined, just pace yourself and be patient and enjoy this.  I can't tell you enough how much I love it.  It was the kick I needed to get back on my treadmill too!  I can't wait to get back at it each day!  

Tip:  I bought a mat for my rug that does not slide and it helps me to remain standing in my 'safe place' even though there are alreay warnings built into the games and system that help you to know where your boundries are.   I also use 1 pound flat wrist weights to amp up my workout.  That may not be for everyone so know your limits.  

All in all, love the energy of this and I am no pro athlete.  Have fun with it.  Virtual Reality has inspired me in a year and a half of COVID lockdowns.  Safe fun with plenty of benefits physically and mentally."

1631,jmac,"May 4, 2021 at 7:44 PM",3,Over Priced,"Enjoyed using the app during the trial period and it has lots of potential but in my opinion it's not worth the $20 a month subscription while it is still in Beta with the out of date songs and lack of certain features.

It needs lots of work:
- Songs are not current, in fact most are really old.
- Songs can't be played solo.
- User can't create their own custom song list.
- Warm ups and cool downs are literally only 1 minute long. What a joke.
- Some of the flows and combos are not in sync with the music and break rhythm.
- Using the triangles for head bobbing knee bending is very confusing unlike time blocks in BS.
- Despite the triangles the focused exercises is mainly on upper arms swinging about, there is no jumping or side to side movement to work the legs more. In my opinion, SN is NOT a full body workout as others say.
- Can't silence the instructors. The constant talking in game gets old after awhile. Just shut-up and let me enjoy the music while I work out. Yes the scenery is gorgeous Captain obvious now shut-up!
- Have to manually start/stop heart rate tracking on the phone or watch App manually, not in game.
- Filters need work, can only filter on one criteria like time or level and not both. I want a medium level workout that is 20 minutes long. Good luck finding that set.
- Over priced with a $20 month subscription. I feel $4.99 would be appropriate for the current content."
1632,microcyb,"May 26, 2021 at 3:40 AM",1,Not as advertised,"A lot of the reviews are paid to review with 5 stars.
After the 'trial' that is just an intro, you are asked to pay monthly.  Nothing works besides the intro so really you get no real sense of the app at all without paying monthly.
Not worth it since no real trial is present.
Now if you pay them for that 30 day 'trail' (again not a trail but paid trial), then they now have all your information do do as they like according to their privacy policy."
1633,An-Angel,"Apr 27, 2021 at 9:29 AM",5,"Love, love, love!","I have been fighting an illness that set me back for almost a year and a half. 
The illness left me exhausted and extremely inflamed and at times too sore to even think about exercising. This from someone who once exercised 6-7 days a week. 

I did the demo of Supernatural and enjoyed it but felt it was probably not worth a monthly subscription. 

Boy was I wrong, I decided to give the App the month trial to see if maybe it was worth the subscription fee,
It definitely was and is worth it!
You can meet your exercise needs with the many different routines being offered and have a blast at the same time. 

I am coming back from hardly being able to exercise to regaining my motivation to exercise. I started with the shorter sessions and I am now increasing the durations along with the intensities. I feel like I am getting back to my old exercise habits. Having the different durations and intensities is perfect for someone like me as I still have days that I'm not my strongest and need less intensity while other days I say bring it and sweat up a storm with the high intensity sessions.

The trainers are funny, motivating and just what I needed to get going again.
Maybe they are not for everyone but I thoroughly enjoy them and their different personalities.

The monthly subscription fee seems just right for what you receive from this exercise App. A new routine daily with the support of a trainer, whether you see them through the whole routine or not. It would probably be annoying to see them while having the objects to concentrate on. Instead you have amazing scenery great music and a fun routine that definitely can make you sweat, burn calories and reach your exercise goals for the day. 

I'm a huge fan and hope that more people are finding Supernatural as rewarding as I have found it to be. I have tried the other exercise Apps and this one is by far the best!"

The coaches, the developers, the mappers have done an amazing job of transporting me all over the world and at the same time pushing me to limits I didn’t think I could reach. 

The effect on my mental health has been life altering. I have depression, anxiety, and PTSD and for me personally, the exercises and meditations have boosted my moods and helped me better control my anxiety. 

And I cannot say enough about the amazing support community of fellow athletes who encouraged and amaze me daily.

But really, I kept finding myself wanting a workout to end so I could be done with whatever song I didn’t like or be done listening to the annoying trainer. I don’t like that the trainer is in EVERY workout. I thought it would only be in some. You can’t really pick your songs, you can just pick a workout that has a list of songs. Not everything was family friendly. I saw an image of someone flipping someone off on one of the workouts, and some of the songs were sexual. I don’t recommend this."

It is by far my most used app on my Quest 2.  Is it worth the subscription ?  You bet it is, and then some.  I have wasted my money on gym memberships, workout routines, exercise equipment.

I pretty much only use my Quest for supernatural at this point—it’s just the best VR experience.  I bike and run and continue to do so, but this is more fun, and a real cardio workout.  Great for rainy days, winter, and pandemic lockdowns. 

Only complaint is with the high intensity maps. Some of them are great, but some of them make me feel like I’m just flailing, and they’re totally unsatisfying.  It would be a huge help if  I could skip those songs—that’s the one functionality change I’d like to see.  (And on the disco tracks, mapping to the groove would be a lot of fun).  Otherwise, I’ll be using this until my headset is ready for the Quest graveyard."

I was hesitant when I saw the monthly fee but...........the 30 day trial is very enticing.  I'm currently a week or so in.

I have a few updates I would love to see:
1. knowing workouts I've already tried. I dont want to mark them all favorites as a way to track.  
2. Filter by multiple categories would be ideal, I spend so much time searching through workouts.
3. I dont make contact with targets even though I know I didn't miss it. Seems like a technical glitch.
4. Also, my partner is scared of heights and can't play because there's no way to indicate that. I know that's personal but something to consider.
5. I really appreciate the 4 accounts but we have two headsets on the same account, can that work.

I love the scenery. Still on the fence but leaning toward signing up."

I catch myself dancing to the music and singing at times.  Only one negative point is that I am terrified of heights and in some of the work outs you are either at the edge of a cliff or very close to it.  I realize it's not real but my brain is messing with me and my legs seem to not want to move and I see myself backing up which really doesn't make sense.  If there was some way to have some of these workouts where you're not close to the edge of the Grand Canyon for instance that would be wonderful.  It's probably too much of a challenge to have that option :-) nonetheless it's a wonderful experience and well worth the money.  Thank you !

1655,Hunter Hopewell,"Apr 24, 2021 at 4:08 AM",5,My Experience and Feedback,"I’ve been looking for a viable game-ified workout for forever and this is it, people. This is better than Beat Saber, and you may balking at the price. I did too. Do the trial. If you’re looking to get fit, this is a great, great option well worth the price.

I get to workout to some of my favorite music while being motivated by amazing coaches, and they’re always adding more music. I’ve also learned some new songs thanks to this!

Comments to developers:

-I wish I could search by song or artist. 
-I wish you could make custom song playlists. Many times, I won’t do a workout because I really don’t feel like listening to one specific song in the mix.
-I’m guessing this may not be possible due to rights issues, but it would be great to hear a preview of the song. I know you can do that in the app via Spotify, but no in VR. Sometimes, I’ll know the song but not recognize the name or artist.
-I wish there was an indication of how hard you’re hitting the targets during gameplay instead of finding out afterwards. Whether it be stronger vibration or the targets glow brighter when you hit them harder. That would be a great motivator to keep hitting hard.
-I understand resistance to this idea because it may be too gamey, but it would be neat to have a steak counter.

Other than that, perfect app. Best on the Oculus store that I’ve played 🙏🏻"
1656,Jen,"Apr 24, 2021 at 9:19 AM",5,A motivating workout!,"I've been using Supernatural for about three months now and love it! It took me about a month to move to medium and another month to high. The high intensity is intense! It always makes me sweat, dance and actually enjoy working out. Combined with a simple home weights routine, this game has motivated me to getting in an hour workout a day. $19 a month is a fair price for daily content updates, coaches and the variety of music that requires licensing. If you can afford an Oculus 2, you can prioritize your health and afford this as well. 

I do agree it would be great to curate your own workouts. This is tricky given coaches speak across each session as well as it involving a major overhaul. Do it though, and charge $25 s month :-)."
1657,ZombieBrandon,"Apr 23, 2021 at 7:50 AM",5,I Owe Supernatural An Appology,"I tried the demo of Supernatural when I got my Quest2 last summer. I was going to attempt the free trial, but I found the sign up to be cumbersome and I gave up midway through. I didn’t see how it could be any better than beatsaber, which didn’t require a subscription.

Many months later, I decided to complete the signup and give the trial of Supernatural a try.

WOW! I love the coaches so much. All of them. The stretching routines, which I do before each workout, have really made me feel amazing and haves helped my posture a great deal. The game itself has tramsformed my core, which is something I ah e always struggled with. It’s a perfect experience.

My only complaint is the price. 20.00 a month is a lot of money. It’s not that the product isn’t worth it. I would give them 50 dollars a month if I had it, which is why it still gets 5 stars from me. But 20 dollars a month means I may not be able to continue subscribing sometimes, which makes me sad. But I will certainly try to find a way to make it happen.

Great coaches. Goofy name? Great product."
1658,Cassafrass,"Apr 23, 2021 at 12:22 AM",5,Worth every penny!,Supernatural has made working out FUN! The fact that you get a new workout/new songs every single day makes it well worth the price point. It's comparable to some gyms and cheaper than MOST gyms in my area.

By combining different workouts, I am exercising over an hour a day.  The best part is that I enjoy it and look forward to it.  It’s fun!!!"

After getting this I forgot about Beat Saber. Previously it was super buggy but has been getting more and more stable. I've tried a ton of the fitness vr apps and Supernatural is by far the gold standard for me. Especially now that more are going subscription based even though they don't match the quality of licensed music and daily workouts like Supernatural. My wife and I love this so much we opted for the annual subscription and have never regretted the decision."
1661,Ayngel,"Apr 21, 2021 at 3:05 AM",5,"Music variety, great cardio . . .","I'm nearing the end of my trial but I'm still on the fence about the monthly subscription fee.  Supernatural does have a great variety of music and is a very polished exercise game.  Most of the time I appreciated having the coaches' feedback but it is nice having the option to turn it off if you just want to have total immersion.  I get that there was a lot put into this app and it shows- it's nice having new workouts added regularly.  However, there is one thing the developers could do that would really make the subscription worth it to me and that would be having the ability to put together my own choices of songs from their library for a workout.  Some of the workouts, I'm doing great, I'm loving the current song, then get to a song that I really don't care for, and it kind of ruins it for me.  I play through the song because I have to and it just takes away from the fun of it.  If I knew a feature like that might be in the works, I would absolutely subscribe... but as is, the price would have to come down to really make it worth it to me.  ------- UPDATE: At the end of the trial I made the choice to subscribe and I do not regret it.   This has become part of my daily workout and my favorites list just keeps growing and growing.  I've also gained an appreciation for some music that I wouldn't have given another thought to before.  I like all of the trainers and do find the encouragement helpful.  A couple of them have even made me laugh a few times.  The scenery is beautiful and I would like to see some more variety there but overall, this is my favorite workout app."
1662,Evan Greger,"Apr 27, 2021 at 1:48 AM",4,Great workout,"I have done 23 sessions so far and love the workouts, trainers and scenery! However the music is just ok, I’ve only found 2 sessions that I liked all the music.  Also FitBit is not compatible with Supernatural yet, they said it will be coming this year. I bought a Fitbit without looking it up first so was disappointed that one of the most popular fitness trackers doesn’t work with it (my fault for not doing my homework, to be fair). 
My stepson and I share an account but have different headsets.  Supernatural allows 4 profiles per headset but not a shared account.  We have over 30 games/apps & this is the only one that we would have to share a headset to use.  I’m still deciding whether to subscribe after my 30 days is up...I’ll update my review if they make any of the improvements."

Used to actually go to the gym and have a personal trainer, but not real into that anymore. Like the various movement VR things, but Supernatural is worth a year's sub for me. It is definitely more ""workout"" than ""game"". The focus isn't getting streaks or scores so much. I definitely like the outside settings, and having licensed music. That makes a really big difference. Even though I like EDM and various genres, I'm primarily rock, and that is here. Unlike others, I like the trainers and their chat. To improve I would like a countdown of the session visible, and the triangle duck 'n dodges to change colors depending on side as an additional visual cue, and when tunneling through them maybe make it solid."

1674,TangyStax,"Mar 20, 2021 at 12:57 AM",2,Aggressive Pricing and Trainers,"Having tried this originally around its release and getting a chance to try it again recently I can say this game has its strengths but it is held back by its model and shows no intention to change.

Pros
-Licensed music that seems to be expanding beyond just pop
-The game is well optimized for the most part
-Virtual environments are beautiful

Cons
-Trainers are obnoxious and the game will not let you turn them off or turn them down bellow 33% volume
-Pricing at $20USD a month is high especially if this is being justified by the trainers many people wish we could get rid of
-Songs are not skippable and songs can not be chosen. This leaves you putting up with three bad songs to get at the one you like

It seems to me supernatural is trying to sell you, trainers, to your home at a premium and refuse to let you enjoy their app without them. This brings about the high monthly cost of the app for trainers who will scream over your favorite song and try to sing it as your playing, ruining your enjoyment. It's too bad because there are good bones behind this system but they will likely never be realized. 

My advice would be get the trial and delete it when your done, it will give you enough time to be sick of trainers and you can save your money for better games"

I'm hoping Supernatural is developing other types of workouts. I like this one a lot, but I may get bored with it eventually, regardless of the music. 

(1) Sessions designed for HIIT (high intensity intervals) would be great.

(2) Need a setting between Low and Medium. Medium is too fast, but I'm getting beyond Low.

(3) Please add more classical music sessions! There are lots of heart pumping pieces that can be used. And, you don't have to pay licensing fees. 

(4) Minor item: please add an in-session alert of some kind if your heart monitor gets disconnected. I did a session today and was annoyed to find out afterward that the heart rate tracking was interrupted. 

(5) Enable people to use more than one filter to search. E.g., Rock genre AND Low intensity."

The instructors are fun and engaging. (and don’t make me want to mute their voices!)

Best of all though, is the expanding catalogue of workouts themselves!  You can personalize and adjust the duration and intensity to fit your daily moods, energy levels and goals. 

I also appreciate the fact that Supernatural has series of quick YouTube videos that review proper form and the basics of squats and target strikes to help you get the most out of your workout."

1679,Gray,"Feb 5, 2021 at 10:59 PM",4,"Great app, but...","I gave Supernatural the full 30 day trial to try and convince myself to continue my subscription. I met or beat my 3 day a week goal all 4 weeks. The workouts are fun and I truly did get some good ones. Unfortunately I already spend plenty of money on monthly workout related fees and just can't bring myself to add another. If there is ever a version of this app that is just a one time purchase (Supernatural Lite without the daily updates) I wouldn't think twice about getting it. 

Just a quick note, It would be extremely nice if you were able to customize your workouts. My most favorite workouts (songs) are all mixed with ones that are good, but not my favorite. It would be incredible to just line up a long playlist of different types of music and go. Just a suggestion.

Anyway, thank you so much for letting me try Supernatural out. I go to the gym 5 days a week and will absolutely suggest everyone gives this app a try. Good luck and I will be checking in on how you guys are doing."

The trainers are helpful during the workouts to keep you pushing harder.   I would recommend a mask cover or pleather replacement mask, because you will create a sweat in these workouts.  It’s like a better version of beat saber in my opinion, but you also get stretching and meditation exercises too.  The only issue people may have is the monthly subscription, but multiple family members can use the same account and new workouts are added regularly.   The warmups and cool down also need to be longer, but most people just want to get to business anyway.  My favorite workout is break stuff with Leanne....   

For the developers...   Update wish suggestions, could you add something like light bars that come at you that you have to jump over to get more of a leg  workout and maybe allow for different sound effects or louder sounder effects when hitting stuff.   I can’t hear the hits most of the time even if I turn the music volume down."

Different lengths of time on workouts

*Cons:

1682,Sephriea,"Apr 17, 2021 at 6:24 AM",4,"Fun, but the trainers voices are not!","So I have to say, this does provide a great workout and has some good music, but it definitely needs more 80's and classic rock. And more Beach Boys! I'm old fashioned, I was raised with great music and i'm not a fan of the hiphop,pop music. I really hope to see a lot more classics. 

Also, It would be even greater if we can have the option to turn off the coach during play. I want to hear the music and enjoy, not really be bothered by the sound of someone talking and some of them can be extremely annoying with their heavy breathing. Lowering the volume doesn't even go all the way down in the settings for them. Please, we are paying for this game monthly, we should have that option so that we can REALLY enjoy this game more! Especially with the $20 dollar price tag. I'm not rich and can barely afford anything right now."

My bestfriend and I play it together using the oculus party feature (not sure if this is exactly what it’s called). I played for about 30 minutes and I definitely felt a good burn in my arms, legs and glutes as well as worked up quite a sweat. My only con would be I wish it had a couple other genres of music like maybe reggaeton and a better selection of new hip hop, otherwise this is great. I could definitely see how consistent use of the app can get someone in great shape."

1687,KaiMerrah,"Apr 8, 2021 at 8:56 PM",5,Loving it! Suggestions below,"I've done other gaming fitness programs and this is my favorite so far. The monthly fee either is going to be an issue for you or it isn't. It's fairly low if the investment is towards your overall health and well-being.

I don't mind the trainers. My favorite is Raneir Pollard because he'll say some sideways sh*t that cracks me up. I just tune some of the canned encouragement out, but completely get it helps others. I'm sweating after every workout I do and they even sent me a free sweat resistant band for the foam padding (WHICH IS SO WORTH IT).

Suggestions:
-When you go to select one category and then want to sub category that genre of music into L/M/H it just reverts to everything then being categorized by L/M/H of every category. Unless I'm missing something it'd be nice to search a specific category and then extract difficulties from that to choose from
Edit: I see you can do this in the app and add these to ""My List""

-INTEGRATION WITH FITBIT! ( please :) ). It's sad that my Versa 3 doesn't connect to the app so I can see those metrics alongside my Supernatural metrics. Even if it only connected to the FitBit app (not the Versa itself) so the data could be shared between apps would be cool.

Overall it gets me moving and it's as effective as the work you put into it. The motions go well with the songs I feel like I'm dancing most times."
1688,Dancy79,"Apr 29, 2021 at 9:05 PM",3,Great App,"I really enjoy using this app and was pleasantly surprised that I was even mailed a sweat guard for my Oculus 2.  I would love to give this app five stars but there are two items that I feel are missing.

1. Not being able to integrate my Samsung watch is really unfortunate. 

2.  The workouts are great but I'd love to see more variety and a way to track your progress better. 

It's great developers are still working on this and I feel it's by far one of the best out there. I just can't justify the monthly fee when it doesn't sync with my fitness devices."
1689,Tiffany,"Feb 28, 2021 at 7:15 AM",5,Worth the price,"This app has been a game changer for me. I have never looked forward to working out ever. This motivates me and has helped me prioritize fitness. The workouts are challenging and the scenery is stunning and definitely helps keep you focused. The coaches are motivating and have physically kept me going when I wanted to quit. 

A few things to make the experience better
1) ability to customize your workouts. I love the dance monkey routine and I want to be able to do it solo so that I'm not always doing the same workout. But also would be nice to pick and choose songs to create our own workouts.
2) Introduction of more new moves and also some  targeted workouts. For example, only upper body for the days after a challenging glute and leg workout when squats and lunges just aren't an option. 

Other than that I am loving it and I think it is worth the price."

1691,Lindsay,"Mar 10, 2021 at 10:05 PM",1,The coaches need an off button,"I find the coaches mildly distracting at best and often utterly eye-roll inducing annoying during play. I want to hear the music, not stupid affirmations or their own comments about the songs. It’s enough for me to cancel after my free trial. 5 stars for the game play and the backgrounds. It would be better to customize my own workouts and difficulty level per song. Feedback about my actual performance during the song would be welcome too (swing harder, deeper lunge etc.). But the dealbreaker will be the coaches."
1692,tiellan,"Apr 27, 2021 at 8:48 PM",4,fun but too expensive,"the good: great scenery, great music, fun instructors, and workouts that actually make me sweat. i was dubious at first, but happily surprised to see how much the workouts actually made me work! i hate working out, i want to have fun -- and supernatural was fun!

the bad: it's just too expensive. i get that all of that beautiful 360 photography and the instructors and the music are expensive, so if you can afford to the high monthly fee, you may very well find the cost worth it.

the not-so-ugly: at least i got a nice sports liner to keep (with how much i was sweating, this was super useful) as a free gift :)

all in all, i *really* like this app, i just can't justify the monthly membership when there are less expensive options available."

After a day of trying it finally let me through. Then, everything I type is backwards. (Email, password)  Once finally got through that, it then had trouble with my subscription service( which I had already signed up for on the app).   It was just one thing after another.   I never actually got through to do a work out.  A lot of people are comparing it to Beat Saber, so I’ll just do that for now.  It is much easier to use. Guess this wasn’t meant for me."
1696,ScrunchFace,"Apr 3, 2021 at 7:40 AM",4,Only 1 headset support,"The workout is pretty fun & the view is beautiful. However we have 2 headsets & having to share 1 headset just for this app is very inconvenient as we have to readjust the strap & the eye distance every time we take turns to workout with the Supernatural. For $19 per month, we should be able to use our own headset.  Imagine 4 member household having to readjust the strap & eye distance every time.  Yikes. 

I’ll probably wait until that issue is fixed to continue after the trial."
1697,Pita of Pan,"Apr 5, 2021 at 10:22 AM",5,Good workout with the right accessories,"I’ve been pleasantly surprised during the free trial; the demo doesn’t give you a good feel of it at all. L speed is the slowest. You can use wide arm movements and work on your form, like a not-so-slow dance. It’s too easy to treat this as a long warm up, so it’s good when the coaches remind you to put power into your swings and tighten your core, because doing so did increase my heart rate and gets me sweating a little. M speed automatically makes my arms swing with more power. M is best for a good workout. H goes much faster and plays like Beat Saber. If I want to maintain my accuracy at ~99%, I can’t use full arm swings, which gives me a power rating in the mid 80s. I think pulling back on full arm swings forces me to counter more inertia, which works my muscles more and gives me a better workout in M.
      I like many types of music, so the song selection has been great. As another reviewer recommended being allowed to play the same set of songs at different workout speeds, which I highly support b/c Gangnam Style was so fun, but it whooped me at H speed. I’m so very happy that Lady Gaga’s Just Dance came out today in M speed because that song experience was much more amazing than it is on Audio Trip, which is saying a lot because it’s what got me to buy Audio Trip and I’m not that into Lady Gaga. 
      Surprisingly, I liked the coaches even though I avoid in-person workout classes b/c I dislike noisy coaches. I thought I would get annoyed with Coach Pollard the most, but he turned out to be my favorite. He was very funny in the April 1st Polka workout. I don’t know if the coach software is smart enough to know when I’m not using power or if I’m not using good arm swings, but that would be an amazing feature if the coaches ever end up more as sound bites driven by AI.  
      This isn’t the game’s fault, but I have to take breaks to wipe the sweat from the Quest 2 and my face or else it slips during the workout. The bicycle cap I wear doesn’t do anything for the forehead and cheeks. In one cool down stretch, my headset fell off. 
      Would I pay $15/month for Supernatural? Not for myself at this time, but I like it enough that I would buy a subscription for a family member. Even though Audio Trip and Thrill of the Fight don’t give the same type of exercise, I want to wear them out first. Also, with my Elite Strap and Battery not arriving until May, I rather wait for that so I can do longer workouts in Supernatural and take fewer sweat breaks."
1698,Kristabelle Darkley,"Apr 5, 2021 at 7:55 AM",5,Supernatural Delivers On Fun (and Sweat),"I’ve been “playing” Supernatural every day for three weeks and wanted to throw my experience into the collective review pool and weigh in on the subscription discussion. First, Supernatural is an absurd amount of fun. It’s like full body drumming and dancing and they do an exceptional job of steering you towards truly satisfying full body choreography that matches the music in a way that feels more thoughtful than just hitting targets on beat. If you phone the movements in, it stays pretty calm on the lower intensity workouts, but if you really follow through and get serious with the squats and full-body follow-through, the sweat situation is real. So real I had to get a silicon cover for my headset to avoid soaking the padding.

I get that the subscription model isn’t for everyone, but here’s why I decided to go for it after the trial. If you do the annual plan, the per month price drops to a totally reasonable level (I think around $12-13/mo.  1) The workout is super fun. I forget that I’m doing cardio. After 3 weeks I’m not even remotely bored with it. 2) I look forward every day to firing it up and seeing the new workouts and what music they chose. The new music, patterns, and scenery keeps it super fresh and never stale. If it was a flat price program, I don’t think I’d stay as hooked. The fresh, high-quality daily content really matters and I feel like I’m getting what I pay for with it, no reservations. 

As a note, I do enjoy all of the coaches a lot. Even so, I would love to see a feature where perhaps on subsequent viewings of a particular workout, I could mute or at least turn the coaches down all the way so I could jam out to my heart’s content. I have workouts I love so much I’ve done them a dozen times, and it would be cool to be able to focus on the music for the replays if I like. 

TL;DR: Supernatural has earned a spot that no other exercise program has: daily, joyful rotation that I actually look forward to. Worth it, 100%. Big thank you to the whole team!"

I found myself turning to Oculus to see if there was anything in terms of a fitness app that I would be interested in. I took a chance on a trial period with Supernatural and at first I found myself exhausted and in so much pain. Even in my pain I could recognize that Supernatural was nothing like anything I had ever encountered in terms of online fitness. The encouragement of the online coaches and the beautiful surroundings I found myself in kept me coming back and I pushed through the pain. Now I find myself in March 2021, almost 30 lb lighter and with a lot more muscle than I have ever had, at least as far back as I can remember. Even if you feel the cost may be a bit much for you, I can't put a price on what it has done for me. I didn't define myself as an athlete before the app, but I do now. Thank you for changing my life and I look forward to seeing how much more improvement I have when I'm a year in."

1706,EmptyNesters,"Feb 1, 2021 at 3:41 AM",4,Perfectly fine addition to your workout,"It might be helpful to put my comments into perspective. I'm a 61 year old male that is in fairly good shape already - able to do 50 pushups and plank for 3+ minutes.

I've found Supernatural to be a FINE addition to my week, especially while the weather is horrible outside and other (more social) options are closed. I try to do 4 medium level workouts with it a week, each lasting 23 minutes or so. I find the exercises to be enjoyable, and I definitely get a solid sweat going. For that, it's well worth the subscription fee.

The only thing that stops me from giving this 5 stars is a concern about some of the coaches. I'm all in favor of athletic coaching and encouragement - in fact, I appreciate that part of each session. It's quite helpful. Unfortunately, some of the coaches play it a bit heavy on the new age life coaching aspect of this. 

As noted, I'm a 61 year old male that wants to keep his health in good order. I'm NOT a chubby, lonely cat-lady that needs a ""you're wonderful for who you are"" speech just for getting off the couch. If you want to help your customers, educate them a little - explain muscle groups once in a while. Explain the value of good nutrition, or what the warm up and cool downs are actually doing to help. Where is a ""glute""? (I know, but use that as an example)

Pull back a bit on the ""you're overcoming your obstacles and hardships"" or the ""you're perfect in your own special way"" malarkey. I bought this system for exercise, not therapy."

Great workout, love the low, medium, and high intensity

Love all of the trainers! They make me wants to come back for more and encourage me throughout the song to keep going and work through the burn 

Awesome concept! Basically beat saber with more squats and lunges 


Cons: 
They don’t teach you about what the ranks are, what the hell is platinum vs double platinum vs diamond? There’s no scale

Can’t see what workouts you’ve already done/your profile for the day/how many minutes you worked out on the headset, you have to go to the app to check 

You can only choose one filter. I’d like to be able to filter by genre AND intensity at the same time 

Wish you could just pick specific songs to play 

They don’t really have any current songs. Everything is very 70’s, 80’s pop. There’s a couple newer songs but only on high intensity levels. I wish there were more current artists like Ashniko, lil nas x, Taylor Swift, Halsey etc."

1725,Oculingis,"Dec 1, 2020 at 3:44 AM",4,Excellent! (Except the Membership Fee),"I really enjoyed my time with Supernatural, I have a week or so left on my free trial.  The coaches are fantastic, music is good for the most part, some big misses there too unfortunately but I can understand the pain of the devs having to buy rights. In a 25 min workout I burned on avg the same amount of calories I burn from a 30 min treadmill run, a little less. So a good supplemental workout or for missed gym days.

Where this app really shines is with the, forgive the term, ""coach potatoes"" who aren't athletes and have trouble getting motivated to join a gym or to improve their fitness. They will see big changes because they are normally doing little to no daily activity. 

The workouts are fun at first but lose their appeal quickly,  after the first few goes for me, but it's still easy to get into and can be done in your living room. Win. The free trial is a great way to try it out, kudos to the devs for this. I was disappointed my brand new Samsung Active 2 Watch had no compatibility and it seems devs only thought of Apple users here. The only other improvement point for me is I had 2 crashes where screen went black during a load to new song and never came back... this took me out of the mood to workout and re starting the game it had lost all the workout progress! Was quite disappointing but I have no doubts the devs are aware and likely working on a fix.

Sadly, the membership fee will cost Supernatural most of their fans and prospective buyers, myself included. I simply can't pay the monthly fee for a program I might use 1-2x a week (or not at all like this week). People who pay to go to a gym aren't going to shell out another monthly fee for this. Professionals like myself with very little downtime aren't going to pay a monthly fee to use it once and awhile. Finally, it's just not marketed to me, a single male. If I had a family of 4 using this absolutely the single membership fee would be worth it! How is it fair a single adult will pay the same as a family of 4?!

Anyways, I understand the monthly fee model and what you're going for here; but a huge recommendation to the devs:  offer a 2nd payment option, a one time payment. Take away the coaches, and make it a weekly or even monthly new workout instead of daily. Those missing the features will go back to monthly payments! Those who only have time to use the app a few times a month won't miss a thing. It's a win win and you still get paid!  Goodluck in the future with your app!"

I don't understand how people don't comprehend price consideration for trainers, scenery, and especially music licenses. I enjoy the trainers talking to me. They all have very different styles. Ranier keeps me laughing and should I say twerking (lol), Dwana and Coach Doc keep me grounded with humility, and Leanne keeps a smile on my face, letting go and reminiscing on good times. There's also another guy recently added to the squad. Can't remember his name at the moment, but I also appreciate his quirks. However for people that are easily distracted maybe there should be a mute button or just go back to plain ol mostly upper body Beat Saber. I also wish there was a restart song button just in case of technical glitches. Please bring on more Monster challenges and Pros only workouts. Those are quite fun and a big challenge."

I love the 3 intensity levels, different lengths of workouts, a new workout daily, not to mention meditation and stretching choices!! I love choosing the genre of music I like, as well as branching out to hear/learn new songs/music!! 

And, there are 5 AMAZING coaches to help you through each and every workout, including the meditations and stretches!"

But that cost....   if it was $5 a month it’s a no brainer.  At $10 it’s a discussion.   A flat fee would work great.  But $20 a month, $179 a year?   I can get a lot of apps at that price point.

The app is 5 stars.   But the price pushes this way down."

I workout out at the gym but I workout for hours and it gets boring. I can feel these workouts after only a few minutes. It's great and I'm using it several times per day. There are workouts on different levels based on how hard or easy you feel like going, plus meditation and stretching."
1733,JC,"Mar 23, 2021 at 3:10 AM",3,Need more options,"I love it for the most part, but here are few changes that really needs to happen. 

1. Ability to selectively choose tracks within the whole exercise. 
I will run into an excellent exercise that I really like, but it is track 4 of 5. The only way to get to that is go through the whole thing from 1. You need to let users be able to pick and choose, at least after they go through the whole exercise once. 
2. Make your own playlist from selective tracks from different workouts! 
3. What is this cheap skimping out on classical? Once a month and at that, Feb was a pick and choose from existing ones! Please put out intense classical workouts more often and put some quality into it! 
4. Whatever happened to coach Leanne? I really miss working out with her!"
1734,BigDeadGuy,"Feb 27, 2021 at 2:21 AM",2,Good luck maintaining proper form....,"This game is absolutely a Beat Saber clone with forced 360 mode and higher production values, but with significantly less customization and control over your experience. 

Billing itself as a 'fitness' app really just seems to be justification for the subscription model and is likely there to cover music rights overhead. While the music selection is solid, you have zero control over playlists (which means you're at the mercy of their curation process). While that may make sense in a physical gym/fitness setting, that doesn't at all add up as a software experience particularly when out up against any other music and movement based VR game. 

My biggest beef with Supernatural is how it is virtually impossible to maintain proper form and prioritize range of motion on any difficulty level beyond Low Intensity. Switch to medium or high intensity and you're right back into spaz/twitch fest where everything is about economy of movement and reaction time. Pretty much the polar opposite of what I'd like to see in a fitness app...

This is frustrating as this app is actually a solid experience at Low Intensity. It just falls apart at higher intensities. 

Additionally, the trainers really are very vague in their suggestions. You could mute them and have no loss of value in terms of performance on any given track. 

Speaking of performance, there isn't a scoring system while actually excercising... So while you can see results post workout, it's very difficult to gauge where those numbers came from and where to improve. Also, no history to show how you did on previous runs of the same songs. 

The heart rate integration, while nice, is a pain to set up each time and doesn't sync with third party fitness ecosysteams (Google Fit, for example). So you have a measurement for the tracks that you did but it doesn't correlate well to your existing data set across your primary fitness tracker. 

Long story short... If you want a high intensity, fast movement, twitchy music exercise experience you'd likely be better off saving yourself $20 per month (ridiculously expensive in CAD btw) and going with anything else. I'd advise against Beat Saber due to the arrow direction mechanic (brutal on your joints, T Rex hands etc) and probably suggest Synth Riders in 360 mode with custom songs as a substitute."
1735,TreeLore,"Apr 9, 2021 at 2:28 AM",2,Nope,"While I love the workouts, charging 18 dollars a month shows us that the developers never have had to go b hungry because they had to pay bills to avoid becoming homeless.  So they can't relate to the 75% of the population who struggle check to check on a weekly basis.  If tge developers ever had to starve, they would be offering this for a dollar a month so that everyone could afford it.  I prefer paying a one time fee of 29 dollars for FitVR over being charged 18 dollars monthly and letting my kids starve.  Until Supernatural does this it won't be a big seller no matter how good it is."
1736,AMPhoto,"Dec 20, 2020 at 12:46 AM",5,Worth the subscription price.,"The great thing about Supernatural is it is geared specifically for fitness. I used Beat Saber for that for a while, but it doesn't really reward you for power, so it is easy to cheat with just your wrists. If you make too many mistakes you have to restart, and you may restart a lot. With Supernatural you keep going through the song no matter how well you are hitting. I like that. Thrill of the Fight is also one that gets my muscles going, but it favors the right side a lot more.

I like in this app the options for different durations for workouts, intensity levels, and even just meditation. If my muscles hurt or I'm just tired low intensity or meditation is a good refresh day.

The music is great! It seems like every option is there. I'm a 90's and punk person, so seeing that in here was a pleasant surprise.

The coaches are fun. It's defiantly helpful to have someone cheer you on. It feels like they are there for you.

I do wish they had support for my Garmin watch, but they say they are working on it. I hope it is soon.

People have complained about having to pay a subscription fee. It's more than worth it.  They update every day. It's cheaper than a gym, I don't have to go to a gym full of people, and the ability to have all that music (which licensing can't be cheap) is making it one of my favourite apps on my Quest 2."

The landscapes are cool and repeated often . 
The trainers ?!  They are completely unnecessary are really rather annoying in the background.
It could be completely submersion and that would be an incredible experience.
I like it more than beat saver but probably not enough to pay 20 bucks a month for a year.

In the grand scheme of things, consider where you waste $15-$20/mos. So far I’ve found the new daily workouts and deep archive to be a delight - I love hearing ACTUAL songs, and I’m sure you’ll know them too. Working out is fun, and it hasn’t been in a long time. Try it for the free trial - you’ll either LOVE IT like me or you’ll cancel without any cost to you. It’s not going to hurt to try it out, and if you’re like me you’ll find fitness fun again!"

This app is the ticket! The scenery beats other ""saber"" apps hands down! So beautiful! I find myself looking all over the place in each new location. 

The music selection and genres are so great I am usually singing along while I'm sweating up a storm.  

I can't say enough about the awesome instructors. They are very inspiring, especially Dwana, she's like having a bff and motivation coach at the same time. You keep me swinging girl!

For those who are dissatisfied with the price,  when you have spent hundreds of dollars on gyms, and are unmotivated to even go, I would challenge you to reinvest your time and money into something that is actually fun. It feels more like a game you can get lost in and less like work. 

To the supernatural dev team... thanks you guys,  this app is completely amazing. I'm hooked and couldn't be happier.

I know the subscription is a problem for a lot of people, but if I added up all the payments to fitness centers, videos, and equipment that were never used, I'd have a nice jump in my savings account.  For me, it is worth the cost, as it is the ONE thing that actually keeps me moving.  

Now, the coaches.  I don't have a favorite - they're all great!  They have different styles, and are all very supportive throughout the workout.  How much better can it get - being able to choose your level of workout, your coach, your music, and bust a huge sweat while improving your fitness levels immersed in some of the most beautiful places on earth?  Yeah, it's worth $20/mo for me.  This isn't a chore, it's a new way to improve myself and treat myself at the same time.  I'm sore all over, my pants are feeling a little bigger, and partnered with keto, I'm well on my way to getting my body back.  Highly recommend!"
1749,Jamie,"Feb 11, 2021 at 12:56 AM",5,Love Love Love,"My wife and I started Supernatural at the start of the year and in that time I've only skipped a routine once, it is that addicting!  Routines are broken down into low/medium/high intensity and when I first started I could barely keep up with the low intensity routines, but I'm now doing high intensity sessions that are very challenging but fun. A new routine is added daily, as well as new music and locations. The coaches are great in their instruction, as well as their positivity to keep you motivated. You exercise in tons of locations, including beaches, mountains, even Mars. The biggest complaint I've seen is the cost involved. Starting out, you get to try Supernatural for 30 days for free, then need to do a monthly or yearly plan. The monthly plan is substantially less than what I was paying for a gym membership, which I do not have right now because of the pandemic. With my wife also working out daily, the cost is totally worth it for us. Supernatural has made exercising fun again and I totally look forward to the experience each day. I didn't get the Oculus to exercise, but Supernatural has become the number 1 used app in our household.  There are other and maybe even cheaper work out apps available, but trust me, they are not as fun and likely won't keep you as motivated like Supernatural. I highly recommend that everyone try the free 30 day trial and decide for yourselves if your health is worth the extra cost! Keep up the great work SN team!"

Like everyone else in the world, at the beginning of the year I wanted to get in better shape.
Along with changes to my diet, I tried Supernatural.
Now, I had back surgery a few years ago but pain never went away. Just walking around the block would hurt me, and I recently had skin cancer on my shoulder so mobility was limited.
HOWEVER, I have been using this app for 2 solid months now and I have full range of motion in my shoulder and my back feels so much better! I just graduated from low to medium workouts and I feel great (and I am down 24 pounds).
I should note that I have tried several workouts previously; the gym, home Max trainer etc. and I never had results like this.

1754,Default,"Feb 27, 2021 at 2:51 AM",3,Supernatural is NOT a gym,"It’s done well and polished. But the notion of them trying to enforce a subscription with the tinge that they are like a gym is ridiculous. 

They have no rent, they have no insurance , they have no parking, they have no CAM, they have no employees no equipment, no juice bar, no changing/ocker room. They have no trainers per se that can give you individualized attention. They have digital image/instructors  that they can stamp 1 million times.. they’re trying to give the notion of a gym so they can enforce a subscription. I will not do a subscription for software there’s just too many other competitors out there and the price is outrageous.

1760,HELL,"Mar 13, 2021 at 12:26 AM",5,Updated my review to 5 stars,"Previously, I had given this app only 3 stars because I found it frustrating to hear the coaches talking over the music the whole time.  Don't get me wrong, I think the coaches are great and I love their attitudes and enthusiasm.  It's just once I get really into a workout I don't want to hear anyone talking, it distracts my focus.  Anyways, I didn't realize I could turn the volume of the coaches down low enough that during the workouts that it didn't make me lose my focus.  I appreciate their instructions before and after the workouts, during the warm up and cool down. They are very likeable and do a great job.  And now that I know I'm able to turn the volume of their voices down once the music gets going I find this app so much more enjoyable."
1761,GBaby,"Mar 19, 2021 at 2:41 AM",4,Love it!!! But...,"This is a terrific workout app which, thanks to the 30 day trial, I purchased for the year and am SO GLAD I did! Nonetheless, here are a few suggestions I would make:
1. My #1 request would be for this to be a multi-player experience; it’s so much fun to do a workout with a friend and adds to the motivation factor. 
2. THE SONGS - There are lots of great individual songs, but a whole playlist is not always to my liking. It would be nice to create one’s own playlist. As well, it's really hard to go back to a playlist I liked. Better identifiers than ""Shower songs"" are needed. (1st song included, maybe?)
3. THE INTENSITY LEVELS - There are songs I love but at an intensity level that is too easy (or the reverse). Could there be an intensity level selection option? (Beat Sabre does this well.)
4. THE FILTERS - I have learned that it's possible to filter by more than 1 category through the app, but I really wish I could do it in the headset; it would be so much easier. Regardless, people should know about this up front - it’s a great feature to have!
5. THE COACHES - I love having the coaches “with me” during the workout, and I appreciate the ‘feel good’ messages, but more focused comments on form, technique, muscle groups and maybe the health benefits of a cooldown or warmup would be welcome. Many people out there are probably as I am… already  highly motivated and excited to be working out. A little more science would really take this to the next level for me.
6. THE LOCATIONS - Such spectacular scenery, it’s hard to beat! And yet I’m sometimes disappointed when I see repeats; ecstatic when I see somewhere new! I wouldn’t think there are a lot of licensing issues here… any chance you could add to the already amazing collection of geographical locations? Meteora, Greece? Banff, Canada? The Eiffel Tower/ Paris? There are dozens of others… just a thought.
     As I said at the start, I think this is a high quality app that offers great value for the money!"
1762,Marissa,"Mar 16, 2021 at 4:40 AM",5,Worth 20 a month to get into shape,I see alot of reviews about it being too much. 20 a month? You probably spent 20 dollars a Week if not more on fast food. You have to justify the cost if you want this app to get back into shape. And it's fun.

1764,Happyholiday,"Jan 31, 2021 at 5:03 AM",1,Silence the trainers,I would have easily signed up for a year if I could turn off the trainer commentary. Even with the lowest volume allowed and the music on max I still hear them. I personally love working out to music apps but I do not need somebody telling me they are twerking during the workout which is what I heard a lot of during the Love shack song. Give me the option to turn them off and you will gain a happy customer. For now I will stick with Beat Saber/Audio Trip/Synth Riders/Fit Rx and Holofit for my VR workouts. Please let me know if this changes so I can sign up with you guys again.
1765,Joel,"Jan 31, 2021 at 7:43 PM",5,Super addictive!,"I was skeptical at first that Supernatural could provide a good work out. I’m used to running every day outside, and working out indoors typically gets boring very quickly. But Supernatural really surprised me. Not only is it incredibly fun to blast targets to amazing beats, but I’m actually sweating and feeling breathless! And while it doesn’t burn as many calories as running does, I find that I don’t really care...I’m having too much fun! And it’s not just me, my son has also become a huge fan. We actually compete over who gets to use the VR headset next, something we’ve never done before.￼ He’s exercising more, which is a huge bonus, and he’s loving classical music to boot!
I’m so addicted already that I’m putting on the headset several times a day. The meditations are great, too. Supernatural takes care of you across the spectrum, from the physical, to mental, to spiritual. I’m totally blown away. I fully intend to buy a membership when the trial is up. 
I do have one suggestion, which is that adding a “skip song” as well as a “replay song” button would be amazing. Sometimes I just want to get to my favorite track and play it over and over. 
Also: more 80s hits, please! 
Fabulous job creating Supernatural. I wasn’t sure I’d like it, and now it’s my favorite and most played “game” in VR."

Pros - beautiful scenery, fun workouts, excellent variety of intensity levels from beginners to advanced, able to sort by intensity level, able to sort by genre, able to sort workouts by favorite coaches

Cons - kind of pricey as it is a subscription costing me $24/month CDN. I wish you could customize your own workouts as I really enjoy most songs but might not enjoy some songs as much on a selected workout. I wish you could sort by artist and add certain songs to a ""favorites"" list."
1768,EdgeG,"Mar 10, 2021 at 8:04 PM",5,Stay in shape!,"Thanks to Supernatural, I'm building my butt back, my legs, some strength. Can't go wrong, and for the price, I prefer to pay this and workout at home instead of paying for a gym membership that I would not even go to. I've learnt a lot from the coaches already on the free monthly trial, it's a true blessing and planning to continue my membership to stay fit without overdoing myself. It's just right in my opinion. Been sweating and feeling better on every workout Supernatural had to offer. I recommend this to anyone who's looking to enjoy themselves while staying fit. The amount of workouts you want to do daily is up to you and the app has many features to help stay organized and on track. Vibe to the music and become a better version of yourself."

But Supernatural is a supplementary workout—it’s something for those missed workout days or a fun extra to add on to an existing plan. I subscribed for 3 months, but simply can’t justify shelling out $20/mo for a game that I use a couple times a week to burn a few extra calories. Unfortunately, I’ll be looking for another app that doesn’t require me to keep paying every month. Get rid of the monthly cost and this is a 5 star app."

1772,Irene,"Feb 23, 2021 at 12:56 AM",5,The best remedy for quarantine!,"I discovered Supernatural two months ago and have used it at least five days a week ever since. Before that, I hated any sort of workout and hadn’t been able to keep to an exercise routine since quarantine began. Now I look forward to tiring myself out with Supernatural every morning! I love games that coordinate movement to music, and Supernatural (mostly) does this really well - I enjoy the variation in genres and many of the individual songs, and I’m definitely getting more of a workout than with games like BeatSaber. I’ve noticed my strength and stamina increasing greatly over time, as well as my overall happiness. I also love that it transports you to gorgeous real locations and that you come face to face with the trainers, since the three things I’ve been lacking the most in quarantine are exercise, travel, and human interaction! I know some reviewers on here don’t like the trainers, but I enjoy getting to see another human and have noticed that certain trainers put me in a much better mood than others. It’s amazing too that they put out a new workout every day, so you never get tired of the same thing. Everything about Supernatural is so high quality and ingenious. I’ve gushed about it to everybody I know with a VR headset, and even some without! 

If you’re on the fence, know that there is a 30 day free trial, which is the perfect amount of time to see if this exercise routine will fit into your schedule and become a habit. I cannot recommend Supernatural highly enough, and am more than happy to pay the $20 a month to get such an incredible product and experience."
1773,Nobby,"Mar 9, 2021 at 12:44 AM",5,Worth it! But needs Samsung support,"While I have not paid the subscription fee yet (still on the free trial), i know i am going to renew. Basically this is Beat Saber + Peloton, and it's super fun and a really good workout. There are a truly massive number of tracks and workouts and they're added all the time, with some really cool trainers (Dwana is my favorite so far but they're all good). Also, if you do the annual price it's $15 per month which is an even better deal. Try the free trial and you'll be hooked!

My only issue is the lack of heartbeat monitor support, especially samsung watch! My partner has an apple watch and it's really annoying to see her get heartbest data but mine isn't supported! Gotta get that going, devs. 

But other than that, fantastic!"
1774,Jason,"Mar 8, 2021 at 11:53 PM",5,Well worth it,"I stepped away for about 7 months and in that time, the app has improved dramatically. The addition of stretching and meditation exercises is great, the tracking has greatly improved and the overall variety make this a no-brainer. I know a lot of people have issue with the monthly price, but from what I've seen, they're constantly producing new content, and let's remember - they have to pay those song royalties. :)"
1775,Daniel,"Mar 31, 2021 at 4:08 AM",3,"Fun game, great exercise but..no mute!","Great workout in your own home. The licensed music really helps the time fly by in my opinion.  A very wide variety of music genres should appeal to just about everyone.  

Love the varied intensities of the workouts as well as the various lengths. 
Short routines are great to get things going quickly in the morning.  You can do anything from a light cardio workout to dripping with sweat barely able to feel your arms and legs routines.

I also enjoy all of the trainers and they help add to the feeing of a personal coach right there with you. 

My only real complaint is that you can’t mute the coaches voices completely.  Many of my favorites sets I’ve done so many times, I really just want to listen to the music and smash a few targets.  I find myself wishing the coach would just shut up already.  Some of the coaches really ramble on and on, killing the good music vibe.  

I understand the developers comments on how important the coaches input is to the overall experience, but seems frustrating when so many users are asking for a mute option.  Most likely very simple functionality to add. 
You can already turn coaches down to about 50% volume, but this really just makes it more annoying background chatter during the song. 

Even the $20/mo cost isn’t a big deal. I get there is continuing app development costs, not to mention the cost to play music we have all actually heard before. (Unlike many of the other similar games out there).  But at the same time, for $20/mo, I’d like to customize the experience for exactly what my preference is."
1776,Emily,"Feb 12, 2021 at 9:07 AM",5,Relentlessly positive fun,"Though I’ve never been a sedentary person and often have lots of reasons to move during the day, I recently had a couple months of wallowing in the covid blues. I felt uncomfortable and unmotivated- I knew it would feel good to get moving but with gyms closed, weather awful and a generally very busy day to day, I didn’t know how to start. I tried Supernatural on a whim and have absolutely loved what it adds to my day. There are so many workouts to choose from and the music is mostly fantastic (some genres may not appeal, but just...don’t choose those). The trainers are all relentlessly positive, upbeat and encouraging and have plenty of dorky jokes to make things fun. Some of them pump you up and with some you almost feel like you’re getting a side of therapy with your work out. The exercise itself is so much fun, I look forward to doing it every day. I often find myself laughing or singing along (something that would get me more than a little side-eye in the gym) I will continue to enjoy Supernatural long after the free trial has expired and am super thankful to everyone who has worked on it - great job!!"

Otherwise, very fun. The likeness to beatsaber is there, but this app strongly encourages you to push yourself and get a sweat going and the leg work is also a major step up from saber.
This is a workout game and it is very fun.

The instructors are all unique and fun. And the addition of the meditations are great as well.

Happy to pay for the subscription, though if it were cheaper I feel it would encourage more new users. Hope things stay well for the devs!

It would be great if they could maybe have some different plans.  I would be okay with paying $20-30 upfront to buy the game, and then $5/month for the sub. Or maybe having a basic plan with access to only a smaller selection of the workouts without the monthly fee."

Supernatural was asking me to sign on and would give me code to put on app. It kept saying it could not find my headset to contact support. After about a dozen emails which suck the rep was repeating himself for me to do stuff that was not working. Install,uninstall,reboot, etc.
I gave them my number because oculus and supernatural does not have a customer support number. They would not call so I got frustrated and canceled my subscription. Really too bad because I did not mind paying for subscription I think I would have bought a new subscription when it had ended.
Customer service really needs to be adresssed."

But  procrastination was always an issue due to never finding it enjoyable until I stated working out with the oculus!  I actually broke down into tears after the work out because I finally found something that takes me to another place and I can tune out reality and simply focus on working out.  I've been heavy most of my life and this app is going to save me.   I'm stoked more than I can explain. Please please make it more affordable for single parents, that's really the only issue I have with it as of now, is mainly the pricing.

The coaches make me laugh out loud, and make the workouts entertaining and enjoyable. The music that I love pushes me to work harder, and encourages me to use it almost daily. And the playlists are a blast! It's been the perfect addition to my workout routine. I don't like paying for the subscription, but quite frankly, the choreographers have done a tremendous job with synchronizing the movements to music that I love, and that alone has been worth it. I don't know if I'll continue paying for it for long, but right now, it's been an absolute delight."
1787,Psychojox,"Mar 4, 2021 at 6:11 PM",5,Worth the cost of admission,"When I signed up for the free trial, I had no plans of continuing the membership. However, I am now on month two. This has allowed me to get lots of cardio in while the weather is too cold for walking/running. For me, I need variety, which supernatural provides. I am often doing supernatural sessions before and after my weightlifting sessions, and on my off days. People think that they can get the same experience from Beat Saber, but this is way off. Supernatural has you moving your entire body and not just showing how fast you can move your arms. As far as the price is concerned, they are continuously adding new workouts. For games like fit xr, the workouts are limited and additional packs must be purchased. Because of the pandemic, I, like many, have been working out at home. $19 is far less than I was paying for a gym membership. If you are looking for a VR app designed for fitness, this is it, and it is not even close."

Get on that guys! 
All of that being said, I love this app for exercise. It reminds me of a full body beat saber with a private cheerleader. Music is great, I love the trainers and I had a hard time walking down my stairs after using it! So if you're not a fitness tracker junkie like myself and don't mind it not being able to connect to one of the most popular brands, go ahead and give it a shot!"

Then I downloaded the app, signed up for the 30day trial and set my goals.

I even invited my wife because I liked it so much.

However, I couldn't get the headset to connect with the app. I closed both game and smartphone app, restarted both. Nothing. 

I changed my password and attempted to login to the game without the app, nothing.  I spent an hour trying to login with no luck. 

So I went to cancel. Under the Membership section of the app there is only a blank screen. I finally figured it out, I had to ""deactivate' my account. 

Great idea, terrible execution."
1792,cutebuffy,"Feb 23, 2021 at 2:06 PM",3,A couple red flags,"TL;Dr 
    -Not worth the price in its current state but worth the 30 day trial or cheaper alternatives in the future.-

     What drew me into this game especially was how polished it seemed. And it is. The menus are clear and minimalistic, the coaches feel personalized and motivating, and the selection of popular music is hot to swing to. HOWEVER, with the price of 20/mo or 180/annually is it thaat polished? 
    No, it's not. And here's why...

The environments are painfully low res and reused textured are obvious. I understand the limitations of the quest but I've seen better scenes that use much more power on other apps. I went to sit by an ocean for some meditations and I was so distracted by the poorly stamped water animations that i couldn't reach enlightenment
   The coaches try to be your friend and share their life story to you while you just wanna smash some sh** and sweat. And it was a big red flag to me when I realized after all of these reviews that the developers are not listening and allowing to turn them down or go without them at all. I appreciate them most of the time as they help motivate me but we should have the option to turn them off when we want if we are going to be paying you that amount of money. It's fine if supernatural needs to keep them so they can sort out the checks etc but if that's the case... y'all need to lower your prices.
    And finally, is it a beat saber clone? Yes and no. It's the same idea BUT you are rewarded more for powerful hits and deeper squats. Less on accuracy. The daily videos and choice of different workout levels and meditations are stellar. 
     I do wish the main screen felt more personalized (once again, for the price) such as a big ole animation and celebration sound for when I've succeeded another streak day, or hit higher accuracy etc. The end of the workout always feels a little like okay go home and I want it to be like HOT D*** LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

Overall, the named environments, the motivating coaches and daily workouts, and the fun and sweat inducing workouts don't make up for the clear shortcuts in environment, the lack of options we demand, and the feeling that I'm already starting to lose interest. It's worth the 30 day trial, but without an option to pay a lower price for a lower expectation of this experience I will not be subscribing.

I will be checking back in hopes that the devs listen and lower the price or create a better experience."
1793,Raven,"Mar 2, 2021 at 11:12 PM",5,SN is my time 💗,I look forward to my workout every night. It has made me stronger physically and mentally. It's an overall body workout. Coaches are amazing. There is leaderboard and it's a good motivation to see others workout points and get support on your own score from others. Because of covid my gym of a few years closed it's doors. I got an oculus cause my son bought one and discovered SN and I did not renew my gym membership. With SN I can travel the world and workout.

Very impressed with the choice of trainers and classes and all of the feedback you receive about your workout! Beautiful locations and scenery too! Added bonus that I can connect my Apple Watch for a HR monitor.  One request; unless I am missing something, would you consider making some workouts that aren’t really workouts? Like lower than the low intensity? I have an older relative who really enjoys this but was wondering if you could do a few workouts with slow and gentle movements without squats. Just to get the body moving and in the flow.  I know you have the stretching and meditation already .... I’m talking more of a slow paced version of the regular. That aside ...  I give this 5 stars!"

1) it crashes often between tracks on programs with multiple tracks and you loose the entire completed portion of program. 2 There is no dashboard or history of your progress that day or overtime in the oculus app. You have to use the mobile app to get that. 3 it’s fiddly getting it to monitor your heart. You have to open the app on you phone, connect, then go into oculus and queue up a program. That’s a lot of effort and it doesn’t always work either (iPhone 11, iWatch 3)"
1806,DuchessOfMercedes,"Feb 5, 2021 at 3:56 AM",5,Love it. Period.,"So yes the monthly membership fee may be more than a membership at a gym, but what I love about this is the convenience of working out whenever I want and in amazing places. Yesterday I was on the Great Wall!

I also love how it challenges my coordination. My typical workout was almost robotic: treadmill warm up, then weights and cool down on the treadmill again. Supernatural challenges me to keep up with coaches that are encouraging without being annoying. I’ve had personal coaches in the past, and I speak from experience. The scoreboard at the end is great too. I’ve never made 100%, but that’s what pushes me! 96-98: still not at 100 but I’ll try tonight again! A little suggestion is to add arm or ankle weights if you want to really work your arms n legs. 

Very well thought out, love the different coaches and their styles, choices of music (I like driving beats. I’m a  Beast Mode on @Spotify) the beautiful venues, new programs everyday and even offers meditation. This is a full service workout for mind, body and soul, makes sweating SO much fun and compared to Mirror or other home workout programs, it’s not that expensive. Then again...

...being healthy is priceless."
1807,KDSAB,"Feb 27, 2021 at 6:44 AM",3,Love this app!,"I love this app. It’s given me a reason to get some exercise without having to purchase a gym membership or buy home exercise equipment I may only use a few times. The only negatives I would have would be the app not being able to tailor to the needs of the person using it. For example, since I haven’t really exercised to any extent for a while, I’ve been sticking to the low intensity workouts. However, the low intensity became a little boring so I started to try the medium intensity workouts. The problem is the intensity goes from 1 to 11. I can’t even imagine what a high intensity workout is like. My suggestion is that based on a person’s profile and workout results, the app would be able to adjust to that person’s abilities and increase as those abilities improve.

The other suggestion I would make is where you adjust the depth of your squats and lunges; I choose not to do them because it’s difficult for me to do them. It would be nice if you set up your profile to not do them, that the app would remember that.

A quick update to my review; I went to go do a workout tonight and when I turned on my Oculus, it said there was an update for Supernatural so I went ahead and allowed the app to update. Once the update was finished, I tried to launch the app. It immediately crashed. I tried restarting my Oculus and tried launching the app again, it crashed again. I look forward to working out every night using this app, it’s a fun way to exercise. However, I’m very disappointed that I can’t use it.

Thank you!"

1810,Allannah,"Mar 7, 2021 at 2:06 AM",3,Great potential,"Supernatural is a great workout with a lot of positives, however, I don't think it is worth the current price, especially if you don't have 3 other people to share the cost with. Following is a review based on the free trial.

Positives:
1. Great workout, got a good sweat and burn.  
2. Incredible environments, starting a day under the sun in a wonderful place always made my day, especially during the winter in the middle of the pandemic.
3. Decent selection of music.
4. Additional stretch and meditation options.
5. Fun coaches.

Negatives:
1. Price. Even with the large number of workouts, it is still all the same workout, with minor variations. The coaches don't really contribute much, especially after using the app for a while. The environments are also repeating, as well as the songs. Having the option to add profiles is pointless if there is no one to add. None of these really justify the high price. 
2. Music genre is very wide. For example, if you select rock, it can have heavy metal songs mixed with rock ballads. Having a better way to select playlists would be better, as well as keeping the consistency within a workout. 
3. I have a big enough, however, a bit limited place to work out. When turning around, if I accidentally moved to close to the border, the game would glitch which messed up my rhythm. 
4. There was no progress shown when doing the same workout multiple times. 

Summary:
Even though I really enjoyed Supernatural, I cannot justify the cost of it. If you can afford it or have other people to share the cost, I definitely recommend it. However, I have cancelled my subscription. Instead of paying for it, I will use the money to get a couple of different games to vary my workout. I will keep my eye on it, and reconsider if there are changes in the future."

The beautiful landscapes add a smile to my face and bring me an extra level of joy!  When it came time to choose whether to do the subscription or not I questioned if it would get old or loose it’s luster over time.  So far it has not!  It also helps that new elements are being added and tested as well.  I found that fast feet pushed my heart rate up, leg lifts added a new dynamic, etc.  I highly recommend giving this a try.

While much of the music is a bit too ""top 40"" for my taste, coaches are motivating and really excel at keeping you going! The Facebook group is also a great place to exchange with other people who use the app.

However, the workouts are very difficult to coordinate in a small apartment. I have a 6x6 space which is fine for lower intensity workouts, but if you want to progress, you really need a bigger space. The higher intensity workouts go fast and involve much more 360-turns. I wish I could go on with the workouts but I can't, since there are no options for 180-degree workouts or smaller spaces.

To finish on a good note the devs and coaches are really involved in this app. Overall it is worth a try and I hope you are blessed with a bigger living space than I do!"

1822,Jo-Z,"Feb 9, 2021 at 8:41 AM",5,Best work out on the oculus line up,"They say there is new content everyday and there is, however, it’s often easy or medium tracks or meditations or stretching. Which is not what you will want this program for. I’m sure those are the easiest and cheapest to make but there are plenty of easy and medium tracks already in the system for people to get proficient in the app. Once you know what you’re doing, which happens really quickly as it is not difficult skill-wise, no one wants to go back to low level tracks. They would just feel bored.

If there were new difficult tracks everyday this app would be amazing despite my three other thoughts which are as follows;

The music is often wrong for what this is. After showing this game to over 20 of my friends I can tell you that it is not a game for men. The woman are the ones who love it and I have actually gotten 2 women to buy an oculus for this game alone. But they cater to men. Pantera?! Megadeath?! Who the fork are you trying to appease with that crap?? The music is terrible. They are pandering to men because men have VR headsets. But with oculus being so affordable, more and more women will be in the system and if they start catering to that demographic now they could be huge. 

Where is the club music? The dance music? Where is the music made for us to move our bodies in the way this system was really designed to get us to move our bodies? It doesn’t have to be new or expensive club music. Take your most prominent female demographic and search what the top club songs were when they were 21. We’ll all be hypnotized.  

And lastly, you’ve got to be able to turn the trainers all the way off. There’s nothing worse than getting into a rhythm and then some lady starts talking about how she loves this song and no matter how many times you play that track she still loves that old song, or she’s still telling you about how she heard this song with her first boyfriend and telling you that story over and over. Oye. 

One last thing, the system is super glitchy. Often you’ll play a track and there will be no music with it and you’ll have to go out and back in, or the song just won’t load. 

This app is extremely expensive as far as VR apps go. It needs to be not just good, but great and it easily can be. I suspect it will only get better and I am happy to watch it do so because it’s an incredible work out and I am stronger than I have ever been. I really don’t want to get bored. 

Thanks for reading."
1823,Darkoob,"Feb 7, 2021 at 6:32 AM",5,Worth it!,"The app and workout designs are done extremely well and the continuous update is definitely keeping the experience fresh and somewhat unique compared to other similar apps. Yes, obviously everyone would be happier without the monthly subscription fees, but I understand that it's necessary to keep the company going and if you think about it realistically, it will cost you around 3-4 cups of coffee per month! Also, paying for something on a regular basis can motivate you to commit more and to make your money worth. 

That being said, I suggest the developer to consider an alternative cheaper subscription option maybe with less frequent updates or other limitations for those who might benefit from the core functionality of the app.

BTW, you can totally listen to your own music while doing the workouts (mute the app audio and play your music separately). Obviously, the music beats wouldn't be synced with the balls appearance, but you can just create your own choreography and move around with your music while hitting the targets! It worked surprisingly well for me. While on the topic, developers, please make a workshop version and let users create their custom workouts with their own music. Just a small favor to ask 😁"

1. Custom Playlist - Even if that means multiple coaches in the same play list.
2. Search by song or artists, I remember a workout I did with this song but can't find it, it would be helpful.
3. Fix the songs that are off beat. Sometimes you play a level and it's not flowing right.
4. Song suggestions 
5. Contests to pick new music"
1825,Tull,"Feb 22, 2021 at 5:29 AM",5,"An intense, positive workout! Add Jazz!","I decided to give Supernatural a try despite initial trepidation about a subscription fee. 

Man, I’m glad I did! First off it’s totally free for a month, so you can check it all out. But I’m going to stick with this past the free trial. 

I want to get to several things ive been loving about supernatural but first I want to add a request so it’s not lost: PLEASE ADD THE JAZZ GENRE! You’ve got country(!), hip hop, electronic, pop, rock, punk, even a little classical (need more of that too!) but how in the WORLD do we not have the Jazz genre? I think I saw one playlist that had some Jazz stuff. 

  Jazz was THE MOST popular music in the world and in the U.S. all through the 50’s until the 60’s and the Beatles changed that. 

But there is such a rich diverse realm of Jazz sub-genres that would perfectly fit this app. 

Check out funk-style Jazz with Herbie Hancock’s Chameleon or The Watermelon Man. Classics! 
Or Eddie Henderson’s brilliant Jazz fusion trumpet work in Kumquat Kids. 
Or Freddie Hubbard’s brilliance with Lonely Soul. 

This kind of music MOVES, is musically brilliant, and never ever boring. PLEASE add the finest, most exquisite genre in music that  almost all the other genres have sampled from, the Jazz genre.  Electro-swing like what synth riders has as a genre is both current and fantastic, that’s another type of jazz that would work so well with this app.

The things I love about Supernatural:

1) beautiful actual world wide location footage.

2) engaging trainers who walk us through a stretch and cool down in every workout that is short but decent; without them I’d probably usually skip these important elements of a full workout: which one should never do.

3) goes from super easy to insanely hard depending on what lvl you pick and also has stretching workouts and meditations. Loved both of those last two that I’ve done, and really loved the medium intensity workouts I’ve done so far. Thanks for including Beck and Beethoven and Knife Party and some good hip hop; P L E A S E include Jazz. <3

4) I loved the app so much I decided to go get a heart rate tracker (I got the Apple Watch 3, the cheapest still supported Apple watch that target had); it works perfectly with the watch to give perfect graphs and heart rate details in VR. Love it!!

5) apparently you add new workouts every day?! Who else does that?! Love it. I see this staying fresh, especially if you’re a music lover. It’s all about conducting to the music forcefully and accurately. 

There’s more but that’s it for now. A big 5 stars even though we’ve GOT to get some lively Jazz in this thing too! Make my dream come true!!"
1826,The Gamer's Grotto,"Feb 22, 2021 at 6:05 AM",5,"Supernatural is a great, fun workout!!","I am 7 days towards finishing my trial of Supernatural and already feel, much like others do, that it is highly beneficial.. However the cost for subscriptions in Canada is a bit high (Close to $300.00 yearly or close to $30.00 monthly) .. 

I enjoy the coaches and their warmup stretches, cooldown stretches and all around commentary and supportive narrative during the workout sessions.. Likewise the constantly changing music scores provided to work out to each day are a welcome treat..

Supernatural basically plays out like Beat Saber on steroids lol.. You'll be striking and squating your way to a healthier you with some great tunes and great suggestions, advice and encouragement from the various coaches in the workouts.. 

I try to do at least 1 or 2 warmup stretches a day and then one actual physical workout.. Still can't get to the intermediate sessions without collapsing to the floor midway through like I just outran a tornado lol.. But I am able to do the basic and medium level excercise/game courses with no problems..

If you are serious about excercising and would like to add a little fun to the mix with some really cool (and sometimes funny) coaches to help you along the way.. as well as new daily excercise routines.. You can do no better than Supernatural..

Try the 30 day trial and see for yourself!! .. and sweat yourself into a happier and healthier you to some great tunes and great fun!! :)"
1827,carmelclosure,"Feb 21, 2021 at 7:37 AM",5,Because the customer service is Awesome!,"I downloaded this at the end of January neither weather prevented me from going outside to workout like I usually do. Unfortunately i was able to try it a day or two before I became hospitalized. I ended up missing the entire trial period and was still in the hospital when the app started charging. Thankfully when I did get out the hospital and noticed the charge, I was quickly refunded for the monthly charge. And because of that I may try this again once my vertigo gets under control❤️ I hate I missed the trial period because that would have let me know if I liked the actually workouts. But because of their stellar customer service I may try it anyway. I need to go back and see if I will be locked in a contract first.lol Especially because I did not get a chance to really explore the app, but from the little i saw . I may actually like it❤️ Thank you Supernatural Support for being so understanding 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"
1828,Josh,"Mar 12, 2021 at 7:35 PM",4,Thoroughly hooked w/room for improvement,"I am loving this app - it's got a great song lineup and the scenery for each one is absolutely gorgeous! 
A few things I would suggest, though:
1. Add a capability for users to filter by multiple criteria - If I want to run an Easy workout, it shows me all (E) workouts regardless of music style or length; if I want a Rock workout it gives me all Rock options regardless of difficulty or length; if I want a short workout... you get the idea. It would be nice to be able to select a combination (Easy, Rock, and Short, for example) and get a list of all workouts that meet all three criteria without having to choose one then weed out from there.
2. In the list of completed workouts, it shows the songs included but not the locations - it would be nice if the workouts could display both in case I wanted to revisit a particular location more than a particular song but didn't remember which workout it was in.
For what you get with this I think $20/mo, or $179/yr, is well worth it. It's definitely more likely to keep my interest than a gym membership - especially in the age of the pandemic!"

Although I'm not a fan of all the genres, there is lots to keep me going.  In a perfect world it would be nice to be able to create a custom playlist of songs.
It would also be helpful it the song list were visible on the title card.  Having to click on each one to see the list when choosing a workout is a bit tedious and time consuming.  
The filters are great but would be significantly more helpful if it were possible to filter by more than one category at a time ie: genre & instructor & intensity level.
My sister also uses this app and we would love to be able to do it in multiplayer mode.
All in all this app has been a terrific way to keep active especially when the gym has been off limits."
1833,Sleeptalk,"Jan 2, 2021 at 1:08 AM",5,Surprised!,"I'm not sure if I will be able to express how surprised I am about Supernatural. It's expensive, seems like just another knockoff of Beat Saber, and I've always been turned off by coach-in-your-ear style workout videos. But it is so much more than all that! What's important here and what sets it apart is that the songs are curated into themed playlists by the instructors. Not having to choose each song individually is nice, and the coaches like talking about their choices. The coaches are actually really charming and each one seems to have their own curatorial style. 
The music is consistently good and I think it's really cool that we will always have a new playlist to try out every day.

While it's true that this isn't the ultimate all-in-one workout, my heart rate is consistently at 120-150 btm during a session and it keeps me engaged enough to do it every day. I have noticed my activity levels during the past week have greatly increased, not taking into account my time in the game. I have gone on more bike rides, done more projects around the house, read more instead of escaping into the television. Running is great and all, but the intense focus needed to coordinate the left and right side of your body reacting to these silly floating balls is really meditative. 

I love to dance and it's hard to justify dancing for 30 minutes straight all alone in your apartment. I'm happy to be a subscriber to Supernatural."

1842,chris,"Mar 9, 2021 at 5:19 AM",4,Great Workout just expensive,I love this program and used it almost a couple days a week BUT it was just me and I can’t justify the 20 dollar or even 15 a month if you pay yearly cost compared to other services. I like others completely understand the membership fee though I wish they had a single user option that was cheaper. If it ever goes down in price Id join but as it stands right now no.
1843,Holopupenko,"Jan 24, 2021 at 4:58 AM",5,Seriously Awesome,"With due respect, complaining about the subscription cost (for a year subscription it’s only about $15/month or about the cost of 2 lattes per month!) is strange. If you then go from that to all the app offers, then the complaints go from “strange” to dumb.

I suspect the complaints generally come from those who weren’t going to use the app that much (= don’t work out that much) in the first place (as one of the complainers openly stated, “only occasionally”). Well, haters gonna hate, I guess. If you use the app M-F (~20 times per month), that’s less than a dollar per day for a substantial positive impact on your health.

With this app our family will likely cancel our YMCA membership, which is substantially more per month than supernatural. Losing access to a pool by dumping the YMCA? Yeah, but pool memberships can be found.

In fact, I also suspect that health club owners (those who understand the potential of Supernatural) will be facing significant competition... translating into potential losses of revenue. The Supernatural developers might consider partnering with health clubs... and, of course, Oculus will be happy about that as well.

My experience? I’m generally in quite good shape (combo swimming, running, elliptical), but this app kicked my butt! Now that I’m able to get through a Medium-level workout (~10-12 min, sandwiched between two ~25 min Easy-level workouts), I feel I could give Conan the Barbarian a run for his money in a sword fight. I can’t wait to master the High-level workouts! The coaching is ever-present and very encouraging, the new-workout-a-day is great, the music is fantastic, the sceneries stunning. Developers: I salute you: PLEASE keep up the work, keep adding new scenery, please pass on my kudos to the coaches. My only other recommendation is to consider developing another app at the level of Supernatural but dedicated to other forms of sports. For example, how about equipment-less HIIT workouts, if possible? Thank you also for the free sweat-resistant cover for the foam on the headset.

Oculus: if this keeps going, sweating inside headsets will become more and more of an issue. Might you consider for future models some kind of passive ventilation system, or a tiny active (fan/fans) system? Just a thought."

1846,Eve,"Jan 1, 2021 at 6:14 AM",5,Update,"Almost done with my 30 day trial.  I love it.  These workouts not only provide great cardio but they work on your focus and coordination, which, to me, puts it over the top.  I've also found workouts with some good grunge music from the 90's.  They even created surprisingly good workouts to long hair rock ballads- who knew!!  It really is amazing to me what the devs have done with this app, from the scenery, to matching the music to the workouts and awesome instructors- my personal favorites are Leanne, Raneir and Dwana- all have great energy and Raneir is hilarious:)  The annual fee works out to like $0.49/day!  It would be cool if PayPal was an option so folks that needed to had more time to pay.  I  just upgraded to the yearly subscription- thank you stimulus check, haha. 



Initial review: 

Definitley gets the blood pumping, beautiful scenery too.  The music seems oldish- so far the rock songs seem light and from the 80's.  How about some Grunge music and heavy metal?  I could definitley tear up a workout to some Linkin Park , Godsmack, Metallica, Alice in Chains, etc.  Anywho I'm just starting the trial and like it otherwise.  I doubt this would supplement my workouts enough to pay $20 more/per month as I'm already signed up with Beachbody on Demand and they just snatched their annual fee out of my account without even a reminder:/ Maybe another fee option could be to base it on how many times you use it per week or month would appeal more to folks."

The workouts have a range of options: low, medium and high intensity. There’s also stretching and meditation just became newly available as well. The music has a pretty great selection and it’s an intense workout - I’m always drenched in sweat by the end. It’s become my fave way to workout - zero distractions and it’s fast and effective.

I mix up my workouts with blasts and longer workouts as well as low, medium and high intensity depending on my own mood time and other life demands. 

I can use in the stationary 3x3 space as long as have full arm length room around me so I don’t hit anything (again... haha) and the ceilings are high enough for full reach. 

I’m not a gym person but I have been in the dance and fitness business for over 20 years. I enjoy the daily addition workouts with changes of music and the option of trainers (I have my favorites) returning for my daily workouts. 

My sister, who has a personal trainer, got more out of this VR workout in cardio, toning and after-burn than her three time a week training workouts. She has the tone and body to show that she’s an athlete, just like me. 

The longer free trial was a great way to see what this was about after the free app download “how to” sample which I did for three weeks before even allowing myself to commit to the bigger trial. I even stopped my subscription and decided to join again since I cannot find any workout that not only is this fun and mobile but can take you away to exotic places and  “be there” for the escape. 

To the neigh-sayer, enjoy your gym, having to get geared up and watching others in the same four walls. For me as a private person, who has public image, working out in privacy is part my lifestyle and I recommend to anyone who has a VR...download this app for a great fun and fabulous workout!"

1863,Nate,"Mar 3, 2021 at 5:02 PM",4,Supernatural vs Beat Saber etc,"I have done a lot of research on fitness apps, including reading reviews and playing a variety of titles to see what's out there and just how good it is for using the Q2 for getting fit. There are a lot of comparisons between Supernatural and Beast Saber, for obvious reasons, but for me it comes down to this; Beat Saber is a game that, at best, gets you sweaty, while Supernatural is an exercise routine that uses games to make it more fun. Supernatural is just better as an exercise platform because it's designed from the ground up to be that, whereas Beat Saber is designed to be fun and challenging first, and while that may get you moving and sweating it's not designed to be an exercise app. I like the settings of Supernatural as well, which are beautiful and calming, vs the night club atmosphere of Beat Saber. Don't get me wrong, I like Beat Saber too, but I prefer Supernatural for a true workout. 

That said it really comes down to price. Is Supernatural worth it? Well that's a matter of personal finances but I would say as it stands today, no it is not. There are lots of workouts, but there are only a few coaches and the exercise is really designed around only one kind of activity. To be worth the monthly fee, I'd like to see Supernatural offer a wider variety of activities like boxing/martial arts, weight training, and others. Just knocking balls out of the sky gets tedious, no matter what the music or the setting. I'm hoping that Supernatural is developing new kinds of exercise for the platform but until they do, I cannot recommend the steep monthly price."

1865,Tarleton,"Mar 2, 2021 at 11:23 PM",3,Not worth the money,"I use the app frequently and alternate it with Neat Saber. Three days ago it stopped working altogether  and I guess I’m going to cancel. The monthly charge is truly disproportionately high compared to what is being delivered (just another type of Beat Sabre program). There is very little training from the trainers, and as noted in another review, the chatter during the sessions is more of a distraction than a help. The sessions themselves cease to be much of a full body workout and are more of a light Sabre game. It could be much more (and function more like Mirror), but until then, it might be worth $5 a month - not more"

1867,DuelingDoll,"Feb 8, 2021 at 4:36 AM",5,Helping me recover from surgery,"For me I can’t stress how amazing this is for me! I teach stage combat so sword work is a major part of my life. Literally 2 days before everything closed down for COVID in my state an issue I had been having with my elbow became an acute injury. Because of Covid I couldn’t get surgery until November. The entire time I couldn’t work with weapons. I gained a bunch of weight and got very depressed. 
For Christmas I got an oculus and my dad was thinking that it could help in my recovery. He has no idea how right he was! I still can’t wield a sword but I can use the oculus. I approach these workouts as a sword drill. My physical therapist was very impressed by my improvement once I started using the app. It is helping me lose the weight I put on in the last year. And it’s allowing to work on my technique even though I can’t work with my weapons yet. For me this is the best possible workout option and worth every penny! I love it so much I have to force myself to take rest days. I just have so much fun! I have to be like “girl! You’ve gone 4 days straight and your body needs rest. We’ll hit it again hard tomorrow.” So so good!"

1872,MommoWolf,"Feb 4, 2021 at 7:41 AM",5,Makes me feel so good!,"I love it. I am sad when I cannot do my Supernatural workout everyday. Tonight, after a bit of a rough day, a workout with Coach Doc hit the spot -- his motivational talk was spot-on for how my day had been, and 23 minutes later I was feeling much better. I love the coaches. I love their different personalities and the way they talk you through the workout. And Coach Ranier in a tiger costume on Halloween? Made my week. The workouts are varied, and even within the lower intensity ones you can jump more, dance more, and really work up a sweat. Keep it up, Supernatural, we love you!"
1873,FleshyMonkey,"Jan 4, 2021 at 7:11 AM",4,Worth it if you need to work out @home,"Obviously, if you go to the gym or do fitness classes either online, with the TV or whatever, you probably don't need to spend the money to also work out in VR. In my case, my gym is closed due to COVID and I don't like working out to NETFLIX exercise vids like my wife does. So, this has worked well for me. I thought the monthly cost was about twice as high as I would expect, but it's worth it for me to get up and get moving, and I do actually use the app to do that. One might wonder if you couldn't get the same workout for free from a game like Beat Saber, and it's a fair question, but even though the concept and moves are fairly similar, Beat Saber is primarily a game, where Supernatural is a workout above all. The difference being, Beat Saber focuses on making the patterns mentally challenging so you are focused on ""beating"" the game, where Supernatural keeps everything easy to follow so you just get through the workout with a little helpful distraction from bashing targets in a pretty environment. And it is surprisingly effective as a cardio workout, mostly due to the squats and lunges, represented on screen by triangles make yourself fit into. I have a bad left knee, and lunging in that direction has been prohibitively painful, but Supernatural let me calibrate my lunge to a depth that worked for me, and over a couple of weeks, I've been able to strengthen the muscles around the knee to where I can now lunge left, which is great.  

Tl;dr? Worth the money if a VR workout with a video coach is something that will work for you, either in place of or in conjunction with other forms of exercise."

Bike riding is the next least objectionable dorm of exercise, but winter, and stationary biking, yuck. I look forward to Supernatural, and the settings are gorgeous. Worth the monthly fee for me."

I’ve always done cardio but focused more on lifting, this is the first time I’ve done a “program” for cardio.

All that said, I’ve found it absolutely perfect so far.  The workouts are intense, it’s hard to believe just moving my arms and squatting is leaving me drenched in sweat more than a 45 min ride on the bike used to.  And the coaches are fantastic, again for an introvert who has always been earbuds in for gym time having a coach is new for me.  And they are fantastic at pushing you, keeping you motivated and helping you celebrate a good sweat.

Oh, and you get to work out in gorgeous scenery too!  Well worth the sub, I’m excited to see where my 2021 goes with Oculus and Supernatural on my side!"

From the immersive, high-def images of the most beautiful places on the planet, to the graphics and sound effects in the and gameplay, to the positive affirmations in the coaching, to the scoring, to the music selection, this fitness app is impressive.  You can select workouts based on intensity, length, music genre, coach, and type.  There are stretching and meditation modules as well.  Nothing has ever motivated me to get a daily dose of cardio as much as this app.  I’d love it if they could add some yoga, core, and isometric strength building exercises too."

I also do other modalities for fitness like weightlifting and rowing, walking etc. The community and Leaderboards are fun and motivating without being intimidating. I'm a very competitive person and hate not being first in anything, but I keep reminding myself that this is not my only fitness routine and try to be ok as long as I'm in the top ten four the week. So, I actually find myself doing two or three workouts just to keep up on the leaderboard and that has translated into very noticeable physical benefits in only 3-weeks!!

The scenery is nothing short of astounding... Breathtaking...such a huge part of the experience and having familiar top music really adds to the experience as well.

The trainers are great! My only comment is I love Rainier, he's a sweetheart--motivation and encouragement is great--but he tends to talk WAY too much during the workout and I find him distracting at times.

Is it worth the $20 a month? Hell yes! Over and over again!!"

There are a lot of different kinds of music to choose from although would love to see the genre of Christian music. There are different coaches to choose from. My favorite is Mark. Some of the other coaches can be “new age-y” in their coaching approach. But over all it’s a great workout app with something new everyday. Subscription is a bit costly (I believe if it were less there would be even more subscribers) but for right now I am a subscriber and am enjoying myself.
1884,Seanduh,"Feb 21, 2021 at 1:35 AM",4,I really like this game but...,This is one of my favorite games on my quest. I love the music selection and different daily workout. Its very fun to the point you can forget your working out until your sweating like crazy of course. Lol I wish we could select songs that we want to play singularly or make a playlist of our own. I also wish a person could pick the difficulty of the playlist that are already created or of songs in general. I found that the playlist I love the most are only offered on hard and I’m not quite that good yet. Lol I wish we could compete with friends even if we can’t see each other. The game could makes use start at the same time and who ever scores the best wins. This is a great app so far I look forward to see where the devs will take it!
1885,Porpita,"Jan 31, 2021 at 3:16 AM",5,Awesome app for my ADHD brain,"While every person with ADHD is different, I find it difficult to exercise because a lot of exercise programs are not mentally engaging and they're uncomfortable by nature. If my brain is not distracted while I'm uncomfortable, I just keep thinking about how uncomfortable I am and how much I want to be somewhere else. Exercising becomes a miserable experience that I have to force myself to do and that I hate every second of. Supernatural is fantastic for me because it's fun and keeping up with the targets engages my attention enough that I don't have much time to think about being tired and sore until the song is over.  I definitely feel tired, but I am never given the time to dwell on it, and that is awesome. 

I know a lot of people would like to curate their own playlists on the app, and I understand that, but there's also something to be said for not curating your own playlists.  For me, having a choice of what song to play next is an opening to stop exercising so I can pick through the list if I decide I don't like what's playing, or to spend an hour or more setting up my playlist before I start the workout, or to get stuck in a rut, using the same songs over and over again and getting bored rather than trying something new. I think having the option to create our own playlists would be great, but for me, I really like being exposed to new playlists all the time and not having to choose every song.

Anyway, this app has been a pandemic godsend and I'm so pleased to have it. The price is high and I get why many people feel they can't justify it. But for, me, the best workout is the one I'll do, and I've been using Supernatural regularly since late October.  Compared to my history with unused gym memberships, this app is an extreme success story for me."

Recently got the oculus and now we are both working out daily. I love the music, the way it’s like beat saber but more complicated arm movements. The squats and lunges really make it a full workout. Great amount of options for the workout intensity, music genre, body area focus in the playlists. I’m surprised that just swinging my arms and squatting can make me sweat so much. Would recommend it to anyone. Well worth the monthly fee. Has multiple user profile support that’s included in that price. The profiles can be made to your hight adjustments."
1887,David,"Jan 29, 2021 at 7:56 PM",5,"Addictive, in a good way","I hadn't gotten any sort of regular exercise in years before I got this app. Now I'm getting at least 30 minutes every single day. Yes, there are other workout apps that are less expensive. And if they get you hooked on exercise, wonderful! This one worked for me and many others, as evidenced by the vibrant community discussions on Facebook. Certainly worth the free trial, and if you find yourself looking it as much as I did, you'll probably decide it's worth the annual fee."
1888,EnZee,"Jan 30, 2021 at 8:51 AM",5,Best workout for music lovers!,"I never write reviews.  I also never do monthly subscriptions because I inevitably feel like I waste money.  Here’s why this changed that.  While I always enjoyed fitness gaming, I often find the game graphics hard on the eyes and the music never suits my taste.  I love this for the zen environments and their wide selection of real music  seal the deal.  I have pretty eclectic music tastes and am so stoked to find a dancelike workout set to my tastes that really loosens my shoulders.  I’ve seen notable improvements to my posture and have felt strength return to my abs and legs.  I’d imagine the subscription supports the music licenses which is good for the artists.  Plus it’s still cheaper than a gym.  If you’re on the fence, I’d say give it a try."

The music selection is great,  I love that they have many selections for low,  medium,  hard.  The tutorial was very helpful to get me started.  The trainers are fun and motivating. I only wish it would link to my fitbit, but I think I saw they are working on that. I am totally ready to pay monthly for this because I really love this app!!!"

The intensity levels  are useful for helping me choose an exercise set depending on if I want a full throttle burn or a quick heartrate jump. But as much as I enjoy the exercise, I have to give a lot of the reason I'm staying with Supernatural to the meditation exercises led by Coach Doc. They are calming, sensitive, and help me replace the intrusive thoughts that have plagued me this last year. It's been one of the things I've most looked forward to in my workout routine."

It’s fun, and it doesn’t judge me. I also actually don’t mind the coaches with their jokes and stories. They make each session a bit more interesting.

I’m almost done with my trial and just reach 30k points, but I’m going to continue with this app because it has been a lifesaver.

One issue/ Suggestion :

1) By accident I’ve pressed the oculus button because I’m gripping the handles so hard while striking with the baton.  That means the center platform shifts a bit. And I’ve struck objects in my real environment . Even though my guardian lights up, it’s too late. 

Is there a way for us tolock the platform to help keep us positioned?

I think it would be great to be able to choose the pass through as the background in case someone is worried about hitting objects."

Even when my muscles are burning from the previous day’s workout, I STILL want to open up Supernatural for a workout or two!

1901,M,"Feb 17, 2021 at 12:46 AM",4,"So Wonderful, But Glitchy","I’m a woman in my thirties and I love to do high intensity workouts, but I have a back injury where it’s dangerous for me to do high impact workouts. I can’t run, I can’t do HIIT workouts, etc. but I still want to exercise at a high intensity. I am so happy that I found Supernatural, because I’ve been able to workout at high intensity, get my heart rate into Zone 5 (the CooSpo chest heart rate pairs well), and really enjoy the experience. Also, I’ve tried high intensity aerobics dance workouts before, but I’m terrible at following the movements. With Supernatural, it’s easy to follow the movements. My husband, who uses it as well, has been able to incrementally up his workouts because there are so many workout lengths and intensities in the catalog. 

I’m on Week 4 of my free trial and I’ll absolutely keep going. I feel great and I look forward to the exercise and how I feel afterwards. I love that I can give myself goals with the point system of what I want to accomplish and whether I can get a platinum score. I love being able to split up my goal of about 30 minutes a day because- again- of the great catalog. 

I deducted a star for the regular glitches in the program. This is glitchier than any other app I’ve used. I’ve been mid-workout and it will stall all of the sudden. No matter how many times I press pause or wait, the music will just keep going and not recognize the error. I’ll eventually have to quit and sometimes the program will save it as a partial workout, but some times not. There’s no way to get back to where I was and it’s really frustrating. It also tends to randomly lose track of my heart monitor and I’ll have to pause the game and set it up again.  

All in all, though, I love the program and do it every day."

Yes, the membership seems a little expensive but I’m starting to look at this as a gym membership with your own trainer guiding you."
1903,Bull Wort,"Jan 11, 2021 at 4:37 PM",5,This got me moving!,"I'll start by saying I rarely write a review, for anything, so the fact that I'm here is also a testament to my thoughts. I'm probably 40 lbs overweight right now (5'10 and 220+ of fat) with bad legs and back. This had me doing squats and side lunges, which I normally can't stand, and I was barely noticing. I was done with the first 20 minute workout and saying ""That was 20 minutes?? I wanted one more song"" all while sweating through my headset on a casual workout.

I know there is a membership fee, and it seems high which is fair, but if you don't already pay for a gym to get a great cardio workout (and in these times that can seem tough and scary), then I think its well worth it for the cost, and getting up to 3 family members or friends included.

I will say the only thing I wish it had, or could add with new songs/workouts, is more plyometric type things. I would love to actually jump and move in a few different ways to get my legs and back stronger with the great beats. Thank you very much!"

Yes, there is a fee. I paid for a year on sale. It is worth every penny to me, cheaper than the gym. I honestly don't see myself going to the gym again as this game is way more convenient for me. And fun. 

You have to learn the right ways to move to get the full experience. It took me some time to get it right. Now I feel my entire body getting a decent workout.  I have noticed a huge difference in my body since playing. My arms are more toned than when I did the gym. 

Let me add this might not be for everyone, gym rats or those into weight lifting... It's not for you. This is cardio... For a mom trying to get in a workout... It's wonderful. 

I highly recommend Supernatural. Don't forget to check out their group on Facebook. The social aspect isn't for me, but it's highly supportive and positive.

Developers: I'd love a freeplay playlist mode. I'd still do the work out of the day, but it would be a great way to add variety and the songs I love. I'll still keep playing either way. Can't wait to see all the future updates and improvements."

I know some people have been complaining in reviews about the monthly sub, but it makes total sense to me - I get a new workout every day, with great music that I recognize (and love).

The variety is phenomenal compared to other apps and there is a new daily workout so you won't get bored!!  The landscapes you work out to are mind blowing and although I usually enjoy the coaches during the workouts, if you just want to workout to the music, you can just turn their volume down.

1910,RP125,"Jan 24, 2021 at 5:36 PM",5,One of the best developed apps,"Brand new to Oculus and Supernatural. But I have to congratulate the SVR team for what they have created. Its a stunning piece of design and development. I really am not a gamer but tried Beat Saber and others. SVR is simply another level. 30-40 mins at High Intensity is a pretty fair workout. Not quite the same as running, but not far off. Add to this the scenes and the sense that you are in a live workout and it just just feels more immersive and entertaining. 

I do understand the issues around the subscription fee - SVR will have to keep on developing new ideas to make this approach workable in the long run. For me I would like to see the higher intensity workouts including more varied moves - something that takes the work out even further.

I had gotten and loved other fitness apps after receiving my oculus 2. Let me tell you that it was nothing in comparison to Supernatural!!! 

I’m just a normal overweight momma who wants to be fit and thin! I like the idea of working out. It makes me feel strong and less tired but I don’t actually like working out!  Now I can’t wait to get my oculus on and get in my supernatural app every day! I’ve never had so much fun doing squats in my life! I hate squats! I burn as many calories jamming out with the awesome coaches wacking stuff with a bat as running for 30 min.  

I saw many negative comments about having to pay for the app but have you actually looked at how much it cost to buy ONE song on beat saber! Every day you get a new workout with several songs! Not to mention the library of countless workouts that are already there! Countless because I haven’t found the end yet! Supernatural takes you to amazing locations every single song. It’s like going on vacation and working out at the same time! Seriously it’s totally worth the  few cents a day! It’s like who doesn’t like working out in Tahiti, Easter island, or mirror lake wherever that is! Fun suckers that’s who! Hehe ok just kidding but I love it!!!! 
Thank you Supernatural for making this short, fat, momma a little healthier, skinnier, and happier!!!"
1912,Pranks,"Jan 30, 2021 at 7:48 PM",3,I truly wanted to like it but nope,"I really wanted to like this!! And gave it a fair try. I seriously got bored of it quickly. It's the same thing over and over, and the amount I am paying I was expecting more. I have been a fan of Fit XR and this did not even come close to the calorie burn even at the high intensity. I found some trainers super annoying. Not for me :("
1913,Jessica Mosley,"Dec 30, 2020 at 11:15 PM",5,Great app for those stuck at home,I was going to the gym regularly 4-5 times a week. After the lock down I lost a lot of motivation. This app helps keep me motivated. I started to do a little more strength training at home and now use this app as a finisher.Its great cardio especially for those like me who don’t like running😁 I look at is a replacement for the gym while I can’t go. It’s a lot cheaper then my gym membership. This is great for those that don’t like to plan their own workouts just show up an do the work.I wish there was strength related workouts  so I could really just use this app. This will be temporary for me until I can go back to my gym.
1914,teneyt,"Dec 3, 2020 at 5:37 AM",2,Update: Instructors make app tedious,"I'm updating my prior review after crossing the 60k SN score mark and about 1.5 months of use. I do about 20 to 40 mins of SN workouts a day. A few thoughts and rationale for lowering my score:
After using SN for a while, all ""Low"" and many ""Medium"" workouts just aren't challenging enough, and there are only one to two ""High"" workouts added each week. This means that if you use SN frequently, you end up repeating workouts. This shouldn't be a problem, because there is a library of existing workouts with great music that you can repeat. However, the instructors make workout repetition tedious.
I'm sure the instructors have the best intentions in mind. They try to be fun and enthusiastic, and they provide some instruction that is useful if you are new to SN. However, the instructors also inject way too many personal anecdotes and jokes during workouts.
You can't mute the instructors and their audio is the same each time you do a workout. This means when you repeat workouts, you hear the same motivation, the same jokes the same personal anecdotes OVER AND OVER AGAIN! This is incredibly annoying.
Although you can't mute the instructions, you can lower their volume. But this is even worse - it means you hear someone talking during your workout, but you can't quite make out everything they're saying.
SN devs seem to think the instructors are essential. This isn't true the first time you do a workout, and it's certainly not true after you repeat a workout multiple times. The inability to mute instructors in an unforced error by the SN team IMO. It reduces the game's replayability and punishes those who use SN the most. It's a shame. There are so many aspects of SN are simply awesome, but this is ruined by the inability to mute instructors - something that could be fixed by a single line of code."

1916,Starlab Control,"Jan 19, 2021 at 7:40 AM",1,Not Accessible.,I could not see the arrows to indicate direction until they were so close that making the moves with great form impossible. If there was a way of highlighting the arrows in a higher contrast color like yellow or red would have actually caused me to keep using the app. Without that feature I am afraid I will be cancelling.  I love the concept and the daily workouts changing but they simply did not consider my and others needs here.
1917,Ken Stark,"Jan 1, 2021 at 5:16 AM",5,Best Fitness app on Oculus !!!!,"To be honest, I never write reviews but I had to share how excited I was to sign up for Supernatural! This is escapism meets fitness to the max! In a year where we’re all stuck in our homes, this is the most realistic VR experience while working out. The attention to detail right down to the navigation sounds and menus is extraordinary! Bravo!!! 🙌🏽￼￼"
1918,Halie,"Jan 22, 2021 at 8:50 AM",5,Awesome App!,"This app has made me enjoy working out at home for the first time in years. I love the different coaches-They get me so motivated to give it my all! The 360 degree views of different parts of the world are amazing. The only thing I would like is more! More country music, more hip-hop, more workouts guys! I absolutely love this app, and if you are going to work out with your Oculus (with any app) buy Supernatural’s liner for your headset so you don’t ruin it with sweat-It was free when I signed up, and it’s amazing. Can’t say enough good about this, my husband and I just love these workouts. Oh, and I can now beat my 15-year-old son in Beatsaber.  😎 😅

And I just wanted to mention, after reading other reviewer’s comments, that I have a gym membership and a personal trainer. I am not a “couch potato” and I find incredible value and worth in this app to compliment the workouts I already do."
1919,Mike,"Feb 26, 2021 at 3:43 PM",2,"Ok fitness app, but monthly no way",honestly don't see the point of the monthly fee for this application. It doesn't offer anythit special than other apps. Save your money
1920,kariann22,"Jan 20, 2021 at 8:15 PM",5,Outstanding Workout Experience,"Supernatural is by far the best workout experience I’ve had on Quest.  The hit music from multiple genres sets it apart from the get go, but on top of that the 360 degree play in exotic locals, daily new content and customization options to fit all needs puts Supernatural in a class by itself.

Considering what you get, monthly fee is nominal.  I will be getting an annual membership as soon as my trial expires.

I would ask two things of the developers:
1. Please allow creating your own playlist from music tracks already on the app.  Music is a real motivator and inevitably the current workouts include tracks that aren’t my favorites which dampens my workout.  I’d definitely pay a higher subscription fee to have this option.  Judging from the other reviews, I think others would as well.

2. Allow the coaches to be muted.  Decreasing their voice volume helps but even at the lower volume they are a distraction for some of us.  Seriously, let subscribers choose instead of forcing the coach commentary on us.

All that said, I 100% recommend Supernatural to anyone looking to exercise using their Quest.  It’s truly amazing!!"
1921,Ed Wanderer,"Feb 25, 2021 at 2:27 AM",5,Exercise is fun now.,"If you're looking for a workout app, this is it. I look forward to working out now and often work out longer than I planned."
1922,spiderinda,"Jan 19, 2021 at 3:24 AM",4,"5-star, minus 2","Update:  a friend pointed out where to adjust relative volume levels for music, trainer, and sound effects.  I’m not sure how I missed finding those sliders on my own (oops!) but with the trainer volume as low as it can go and music volume as loud as it can go the “interrupting trainer” thing is now tolerable for me.  Bumping my rating from 3 to 4.  
——————————
I really like how Supernatural fits into my VR routine.  I do only the low intensity workouts, and enjoy optimizing for form and power.  It fills that niche better than any other apps I have.  Five stars there.

Minus one star for the subscription requirement.  I would cheerfully pay a larger flat fee, or even a la carte payments per workout - but I’m not keen on the subscription model when I really just go to the same few workouts every time.

Minus another star because there is no way to turn. off. the. frigging. commentary.  I get that coaches are there to “encourage and inspire.”  But I gotta say, they’re by far my least favorite part of the app.  The warmup/cool down pep talks are fine, but in the middle of a workout they are (to me) distracting and irritating.  Supernatural: please (please!) let us toggle them!!

Great app overall, but could benefit from some user experience tweaking..."
1923,Ama,"Feb 9, 2021 at 1:33 PM",5,Loving it!!!,"I was that girl who did not want to even walk anywhere let alone work out!!! This app has me doing multiple work outs IN A ROW! high energy, so much fun, great tunes, cant ask for a better work out app."

Perfect for people who aren’t comfortable at the gym, or do not have much time to work out. You can get great exercise in 20-30 minutes of this experience. 15/10 would recommend, definitely worth the subscription fee to me."

Those extra pandemic pounds are no joke! Enter Supernatural to save the day! Supernatural is a blast and a very fun way to get in some good cardio and work up a sweat. Supernatural really embraces the 360 immersion of VR. You get cool coaches to choose from, a variety of musical genres to choose from, and the stunning settings from all over the world are breathtaking! Some reviewers complain about the membership fee, but how many actual gyms charge only $20 to join? And if you pay for the year (like I did), it comes to around $15/month. Worth every penny in my book. Supernatural makes working out enjoyable and you will want to get in a workout every day! Two big sweaty thumbs up!"
1926,RHH,"Jan 11, 2021 at 5:44 AM",4,Great workout. but needs couple tweaks,"I've had Supernatural for 3 weeks and overall the concept of it is great and it's very entertaining as a supplemental workout.  The monthly subscription fee ($20) does seem a bit much so I'm on the fence if I'm going to keep it or not as I have an elliptical, treadmill and other VR workout games I can use, but this is the most fun and immersive.  The one thing that's an issue for me is that I have a visual issue and on several of the medium and high intense workouts I'll sometimes lose the white strike pads in the background and vice versa with the black pad in the darker landscapes which can ruin the entire song and my rhythm.  I wish there was a way to change the color of the strike pads.  Also, would be nice to have a freestyle option where you could pick your own songs and go coach-less."
1927,enecca,"Feb 10, 2021 at 12:18 AM",4,Removed a star because of cost,"I can play beat saber for an hour and not feel like I worked out. With Supernatural my legs hurt afterwards and I move and sweat a lot more while ""playing."" It's got new music, oldies and 80s. Love that! Wish I could mute the trainers though instead of just turning them down. They talk a lot during the songs and I just want to enjoy the music while playing. The beautiful landscapes are a nice touch. 

Update: I have played this almost everyday for a month and I can say it's a very good workout! Unfortunately I can't continue with the subscription because I don't have enough space in my house. If you are in an RV like me or are stuck playing in stationary mode, this is not for you. They have me turning in all directions and I was hitting stuff in the house. I could only play in Low mode on certain songs. There's no option for stationary mode. You can't stop it from turning you in all directions :(
I am now using Pistol Whip for a good leg workout and Synth Riders for my arms since I can't use this app."

Supernatural is just fantastic! Stretch, workout, meditate. That’s my rotation for 30-45 minutes each day. The quality of this fitness “game” is insane! Great music, great environments, great trainers, and it’s kicks your butt! Yes, I understand not wanting to pay for a subscription, but it’s the same price for a gym membership and the gyms in my area are closed.

Especially the heart rate tracking, and ability to skip warmup and pauses. (I often go to this game after already warming up with BS or FIT).

There are a few requests that would raise this from good to great in my opinion.
1. Allow for two person simultaneous playing (with another friend on their own headset).
2. Allow the color of the bats and targets to be chosen instead of only black and white.
3. More music from the 70's and 80's :-) (I know, showing my age, but hey ...)

Thanks for the reply. I wasn’t aware of the official song request form. Where is this accessed?
Also, one further suggestion. Create a library with all of your individual songs/workouts which can be individually chosen or added to a custom workout playlist. Thanks."

I’d pay a one time fee of ~20.  But every month?  No.  This is not a replacement for gym, but would be a nice supplemental workout if priced right."
1938,SkyFox,"Jan 2, 2021 at 10:16 AM",5,The ONLY true VR fitness program,"In the reviews on here and the arguments I see on YouTube, the biggest drawback to Supernatural VR is the monthly membership. ""I can just pay $20 and get fit.xr or add another $5 and get beat saber and add my own songs!"". True, you can. But true, the same songs over and over (minus beat saber custom) will eventually get stale and mundane. In Supernatural, there is NO such thing as a STALE PLAYLIST. Not only is there a NEW WORKOUT EVERY DAY with songs from all over the music world, but each one is curated by a physical trainer that you can look up and see their history in the fitness world. Each song has not only targets and squat triangles placed strategically, but also some leave trails to follow. If you tighten up your core like you're supposed to, you'll feel each song was ment to work out certain groups. Abs, shoulders, back, thighs....the trainers know just what they're doing!

   Speaking of trainers, you don't have a collection of random lines spoken by a trainer. Each trainer on here is performing the workout with you and speaking to you through it. Many will find it annoying and just want them to shut up. But those that are serious about a good workout will find the words of Coach LeAnn extremely motivating. Coach Raneir is also a fun one that pushes you through just the right way.

   Community engagement is always a big help. And with the mobile companion application, you can set goals and challenge your friends on the weekly leaderboards. Friends can see your streaks and give you a boost if you haven't recorded a workout in a while. Yes, i know the others have leaderboards, but that's as far as it goes. The app also lets you see the day's workout and bookmark your favorites. Have a heartrate monitor or apple watch? You can sync it with the supernatural app and it will display your heart rate as well as add it to your graph at the end of your workout.

   Yes, it's $20 a month. Yes, you can do something else on your quest. That $20 goes toward licensing for new workouts daily, the coaches that take a lot of time to put these workouts together every day, and the rest of the development team that makes all this happen.

   LeAnne and everyone else, on behalf of my wife and I, keep the good work going! Easily the best and only virtual workout program there is! As long as you all keep this amazing program going, we'll be there!"

1940,TheJaxKumar,"Jan 2, 2021 at 6:15 AM",5,So worth it!!,"I stopped going to the gym because of the pandemic and there is no way I will wear a mask while working out. I really want to get into shape and this was a start. I like having a person to train me but I get irritated with the trainer gunning me all the time during training, so I get fed up and stop. I am not shy to say it but I just can’t work out in a group because I’m insecure about my body and how I struggle to work out. 
I got the VR for my birthday, little did I know I was going to workout with it. Supernatural saved me! I work out everyday (try) the past week has been shy, but New Years, Christmas. It’s hard. But I do 45-1 hours workout. I would never ever go workout in the gym for an hour. Supernatural is just that much fun. I  struggled to hit the targets, but now I feel like a Champion in a sport from the future. 

The $20 a month sounds high for a VR “game” subscription, but if you think about it, the simple gym subscription is also $20 a month. 

I can’t wait to workout everyday, and I haven’t felt like this about sweating my butt off in a good 20 years! 

Great app!"

I’m a CrossFitter stuck at home due to not wanting to wear a mask to workout. I purchased this to see if it allowed me to stay in shape from home, and I was not disappointed. Great music and a series of squats, side lunches, ab and arm workouts every song. I loved this so much since day 1, I played for 90 minutes and no lie.. I could not sit down or walk the next day because I was SO SORE! I’m getting better results from this then most other workouts!

1942,MrDaedal,"Jan 22, 2021 at 11:19 PM",4,"Overall great, needs more customization","I've enjoyed the workouts so far as added exercise to my weight lifting routine. My only complaint is that all the exercises are so arm heavy and only a handful actually specify that they are for legs. You basically have to play them to see what they're about (or I missed descriptions/navigations in a menu somewhere) and the vast majority have you flailing your arms around with only moderate squatting routines (or have you doing quick ducks without controlled deep squats). I'd rather not walk around with knots in my shoulders for the rest of the day and feel like it did nothing for my legs; I can play Beatsaber for that. Supernatural does have better range of motion in their movements than Beatsaber however.

This app is right on the edge of me buying a prescription. I'm typically oriented around powerlifting weight training workouts (type 2b muscle fiber dominant), 6'5"" tall, 240 lbs. I'd really like to see slower methodical movement workouts that are less about speed and more about control. 

I think it would be great if you could choose your trainer intro for stretching, songs as modules & the dominant muscle groups to use for each, and then string them together in any way you like is something that would sell it for me. Adding your own tracks would be awesome as well but I understand that's an entirely different level of complicated."
1943,shxxu,"Jan 17, 2021 at 7:04 AM",2,Not worth the subscription.,"What I loved:
- Beautiful backgrounds
- Great variety of music

What I strongly disliked:
- bad choreography. Never seems to really match the beat. This is Beat Saber with beautiful backgrounds & old-school pop music.

- The trainers are So. Annoying. I don’t need a pedantic preppy voice in my head reciting Instagram-y quotes about life while I’m working out. I don’t care who your roommates were in college. Wow, your basic a$$ loves Pulp Fiction, so interesting. Stop calling me a champion.

I frequented group fitness classes pre-pandemic, so it’s not the hype that bothers me. The high energy of a fitness instructor is essential in a group class, and it’s great to establish a friendship with a trainer by sharing personal stories. But those don’t translate to VR, especially with how fake (literally and emotionally) these instructors are. Every time I play Supernatural I’m yelling at the trainer to STFU.

I only played three times and canceled my sub.  I guess this is a good game for people who are starved for any “human” interaction, or who would rather pay $20 a month for a subscription than a flat $15-30 for any of the other rhythm fitness games available."

To be honest, I read about Supernatural and that is what prompted me to get the Oculus in the first place. It did not disappoint! I love the locations, the songs, & the Coaches. I actually find them motivating, but I can get why some people may not like it. I’m excited to workout everyday now, so if you are losing motivation- this could be your answer. The game is very engaging and it’s a lot of fun to play. If you go to fitness classes, this could take the place of that (depending on the class). I have home equipment, so I’d rather pay for this than a gym membership. You can tell that there is a lot of thought & detail behind this game and you get a new workout every day. You can even save your favorites & play them over. 

If I had one suggestion- I wish they would incorporate more lower body stuff besides squats & lunges. It would be nice to incorporate some kicks or something. I know it would be tough to track (if not impossible for some moves), but it would be cool to have some stuff like that.

I do feel like its a better workout then beat saber but I hit the wall a time or two doing a 45 degree angle and I was not happy. I didn't sign up for the trial but I did look for a song list and the few hip hop artist they had, the songs were old plus I didn't like them.

It has a hard time loading songs/data though & freezes or gets stuck every time I use it. Sometimes I get stuck with the Pong waiting/loading thingy, the “next song” button is empty, and it just never loads. Other times it just stops working after a song, there’s no loading symbol or anything, it’s just frozen. 

So when either of these things happen, or the internet drops out or Oculus messes up, you have to quit. When you come back to the app, there’s nothing that shows what you were just in, no way to immediately get back to the workout you had chosen, no way to skip the songs you’ve already done once you find the workout. 

There doesn’t seem to be anywhere in the app on Oculus to look at which ones I’ve done and any stats/progress (except right after finishing a song)."

I'm so glad I found this app, I just did my first workout and I can already say I'm excited to use this."
1956,Shep,"Mar 6, 2021 at 1:55 AM",3,Not available,I enjoyed the first little session but when I tried to subscribe I was told it wasn't available for italy. Do you know if that will be changing soon?
1957,VonHoagie,"Jan 9, 2021 at 11:08 PM",1,"Loved, but pricing is terrible","There has got to be a better pricing model. I would be willing to pay per  landscape or workout, but the current monthly subscription is very unappealing. Good luck. I will watch to see if other pricing options are added."
1958,Crystal C,"Jan 23, 2021 at 6:05 AM",5,Fun and gets me sweating,Im trying the 30 trial and so far it’s worked wonderfully! My legs are aching just from doing a couple workouts. The time goes by quickly and it definitely makes me want to go get back on and play. We will see if I think it’s worth the price.
1959,i vy,"Jan 12, 2021 at 6:53 AM",5,Great workout app,"Having played a couple of activity games like Beat Saber and Racket RX, and tried Supernatural for a month for free, I subscribed for a year, with absolutely no regret. First of all, living in a northeast city during pandemic at winter time, being able to be immersed under the sun and beautiful scenes like beaches, mountains and deserts alone is a remedy for me already. Secondly, the musics are diverse and I never feel bored. During holidays there are special sessions like the nutcracker one is a sweet treat. The daily sessions are just good enough to make you sweat and feel refreshed and not intimidating that scare you away the next day. Due the limitation of the hardware, it might be difficult to enjoy yoga or palate, but within the capacity, I think the develop team and coaches have been doing a great job. I really wish other users understand it takes a team to maintain quality updates and updated scenes. I have encountered several times of crushes but overall the app is quite stable. For a busy working mom, Supernatural is my little retreat every day. I can do my meditation and workout with my pajamas. Superb!"
1960,Jam,"Jan 12, 2021 at 6:53 AM",5,Great workout,"I was very skeptical about SuperNatural but with a 30 day free demo I figured why not.

The workouts are great. They have enough variety and intensity to keep my interest. I'm sweating and exerting myself more than if I rode the stationary bike I have and I'm doing longer work outs since it's  fun. That's a win in my book.

I'll will pay subscription for winter months, half of spring, cancel during summer and sign up again in the fall when the weather gets bad.

If the subscription was cheaper I'd do yearly.  Having an effective workout you can do in your living room, a workout where you actually don't dread doing it and you do the workouts for a longer time is awesome."
1961,jenn.jones.7,"Mar 2, 2021 at 9:38 PM",3,Way to expensive,I’ll give it a three star because it seems to be a nice app. But no way is it worth almost $200 a year.
1962,Angie,"Dec 4, 2020 at 3:01 AM",5,The best workout app ever!!,"I have been using this app almost a month. Seriously. This is the best workout vR app for me!! The monthly fee is nothing, compared to the joy it brought to you. I start my day with high density workout for 20-30 mins before working(from home). It feels great, especially the “mood sessions” with Leanne. I love her!! It lit up your mood for real!!!  I never have imagined the magic energy of this app.  Coaches are great!!  Songs are great!! BTW. The demo only showed you 10% of the app. I don’t think the youtube blogger reviews are true. It is worth to pay monthly.  It is nicer to workout in beautiful sceneries than standing in a dark room to smash boxes!! Lol!  There is one suggestion to supernatural app developers. If you can program the way it can recognize your user’s name in the app. Instead of calling “athlete!” Make it more customized and personal!! It will be a great hit!!"
1963,elmalo666,"Feb 2, 2021 at 10:13 AM",4,MORE NOVEAU DISCO PLEASE,"As someone stated here, I understand its hard to get music rights on more tracks. I have a couple days left, and have used it everyday in 1HR bursts of high intensity level with Coach Leanne and Coach Ranier. Pretty much, has replaced my 30 minute treadmill run, while also training/stabilizing core muscles for a pretty intense workout. This was a good alternative with gym closures due to covid, better support for garmin fitness trackers. Still need weights at the gym though, and the price is really steep for the experience."
1964,McKay,"Feb 2, 2021 at 5:24 AM",4,"Great, but PLEASE add these features","I just started my free trial and am really enjoying the workouts and features that you have - clearly a LOT of time and thought was put into creating this app. I love the meditation option as well and being able to sit amongst beautiful scenery while meditating feels realistic and super peaceful. However, I’m really disheartened to see that I can’t choose the songs I want to work out to (ones that are already in your app) or which scenery I want to be in for my workout and it’s making me not sure about continuing with my membership. PLEASE add a feature where we can create our own workouts with certain songs and certain scenery.... please! I also think it would be nice to have a “free form workout” option where you can dance around to songs of your choice and hit different targets but not have the trainer’s voice or have to follow any certain pattern. Would also love to see an option for moving scenery that we could use with a stationary bike. These added things would be next level amazing!"

Last night I spent 50 minutes waiting in a sweatball with the screen all fogged up for the last song in the workout to load.  I haven't had it very long - less than a week, but I got the Quest 2 so I could play Supernatural and if I have to look at those stupid sand dunes much longer without anything loading I am going to be even less pleased.  It's great when it works, but how much patience am I supposed to have?"

1967,Iwan,"Feb 1, 2021 at 2:00 AM",4,"Good app, but room for improvement","The short version of this is that this app will help you burn some calories, but there are some minor issues holding it back. My suggestion is for you to try it out for the first free month, and see for yourself ultimately. The main issues I have with the app is that it requires a companion app to download, hard to tell how many calories you've burned, and customization is a bit lacking. The scenery is nice, but you'll be spending a lot of time looking at the oncoming pieces, so it's hard to enjoy or notice the scenery. When you do take a look at the scenery it's great until you notice the tiny details and some items look simply painted on a surface, and not actually 3d. The water itself is a bit off. It's nice that they let you skip the warm-ups, but you need to finish the cooldowns for the workout to actually be registered. I wish they would also let you skip certain songs that you simply don't like. The meditation sessions are nice, but very limited. It would be nice if it's expanded and all the places used in the workout apps are options. One of the biggest issues I had with Supernatural was that it felt like 70% of the sweat on my head was from the Oculus device being hot, and 30% from the actual workout. With all the moving it can be hard to get in a decent side lunge.

Also there needs to be feedback (Visual/Audio) whether you hit the target with enough force."
1968,Coleus,"Mar 20, 2021 at 9:32 AM",3,Boring,Sorry. I don't see the value if this app.  The views are beautiful.
1969,Eric,"Dec 24, 2020 at 6:56 AM",5,Hard to see why anyone is complaining...,"First of all, this is fantastic! It is what Beat Saber is missing (if you are using it for exercise anyway; it’s perfect as an arcade game and a way to have some fun laughs with friends and family). While Beat Saber is incredibly fun in so many ways, it lacks guidance for a workout, and clicking around from Hard to Expert, maybe slower speed, maybe faster speed... I spend a lot of time in the menu selecting a song, only to find out that Hard and Expert skills vary wildly on the different song trees, which gets a bit frustrating. The two programs are just different, and that is okay. Beat Saber is more about memorizing complex movements and timing swings just right to maximize your score. SuperNatural is about getting a workout, and it really incorporates your legs. There is beautiful scenery, and a better variety of music for other tastes. To top it off, there is a “coach” in your ear offering motivation, much like a BeachBody or Insanity type workout. 

Yes there is a subscription, but there is a 30-day free trial, so just cancel if it’s not for you. If you are looking to use VR to make working out more enjoyable (and compete), this is should be a serious consideration."
1970,twheels4,"Jan 29, 2021 at 6:32 PM",3,Great Workout But...,"I'm new to Quest2 and I love this workout.  I immediately went in to see what it cost to join and when I saw up to 4 could work out on the subscription I was thrilled as that made sense from a cost perspective.   Unfortunately what I didn't know after I signed up is that if within my family we have our own Quest, we can't use them as the subscription works only on 1 Quest but up to 4 different users.   THAT MAKES NO SENSE!   That was a selling point so why would I pay for that ability and then have other family members who have their own Quest have to always use mine?   If 4 users can use the app with full subscription then open it up to their QUEST...what the heck is the difference?  You lose 2 stars for that one as I don't see how that should possibly make any difference to your cost.   I will probably end up cancelling in the end unfortunately.  Think about your community and how to keep a win with them spending the money to support programming.  It's not a family plan if family can't use their own Quest.   Fix this limitation and you easily get 5 stars!!!"

1972,Horatio,"Jan 7, 2021 at 10:59 AM",5,Amazing creation!,"I’m fairly overweight and very lazy and unmotivated to exercise. I started the trial tonight and holy biscuits this is phenomenal! The scenery alone is breathtaking, and the workouts, while very fun, actually got most of my body throbbing from the calculated movements. Hands down 10/10 
My wife and I will most definitely be subscribing. Far cheaper than any gym memberships around us and a way more comfortable setting."
1973,Shannon,"Jan 7, 2021 at 12:45 AM",5,Incredible!,"This app combines great music, great landscapes, and the power of VR to create an intense and exciting workout! 

I’ll admit, the price is much more than I’d normally spend on an app, but the yearly rate offers a nice discount, and it is worth it to have an effective workout from the privacy and safety of your home. The subscription grants access to all the workouts of varying lengths and intensities, and the coaches are a nice addition to guide and motivate throughout the workout.

I look forward to breaking a sweat everyday with Supernatural!"
1974,wesley.j.waters,"Jan 29, 2021 at 9:22 AM",2,So Great but So So Disappointing,The concept and idea are great. The scenes are beautiful. The experience is fun and then comes the let down. They advertise it as a free app. But that’s ok. I don’t mind buying an app after a trial if I like it but I do prefer that it’s advertised as a trial instead of deception. But no wait it’s way worse than that. It’s a monthly subscription. It’s not just a monthly subscription it costs more than going to our local gym per month. There you get to use real equipment with real people and real weights and a real track and it’s less money than a subscription to a virtual workout. The virus won’t be around forever so I will pass on paying an outrageous amount monthly for this. I would have gladly bought it for a reasonable price but what you’re doing is highway robbery.
1975,Aramations,"Feb 19, 2021 at 5:07 AM",1,Beat Saber Rip-Off,Just why!?!!? I recommend you just buy Beat Saber instead of this.

Scenery is beautiful but with someone with vertigo i had to sit down & touch the floor just to see if there was an option to switch so i wasnt so high up in the air over a lake or a volcano lol. I couldnt find anything to fix it. Yes its funny i know but i had a hard time doing that. I do not have a problem with Beat Sabber & i know your up but this very different. Its weird cause im not scared lol its just my body gets all weak & panicky lol by itself (its embarrassing & frustrating that my body does it but im actually fine & think its beautiful) so anyways theres no way that i can do a workout or use this app. Please let me know if Theres an option. If not please get one.

Monthly is $19.99 indefinitely. Personally I feel like it’s too early to be charging monthly fees on the VR block. Especially since the Oculus 2 is something many people won’t be able to spend hours on. 

The graphics are great, content is great, instructors seemed engaging.

Our family chose to go with a one time purchase with Beat Saber."

But - no pairing with Fitbit trackers? Really?"
1982,Redmanjack,"Jan 25, 2021 at 11:39 PM",3,Way around the membership fee,"Awesome workouts, but I think this game is missing a large target audience. If you’re already going to a gym, I don’t see this enticing enough to make you switch as you probably enjoy in-person workouts, the social aspect, and access to a variety of equipment. If you’re someone who is trying to get workouts in at home then you probably don’t want to pay the $20.00ish monthly subscription/membership fee. If I had the time, commitment, and wanted to spend that much money, I’d join a gym. I just want to get some exercise in every week and don’t want a monthly fee. Right now, I have the 30 day free trial of Supernatural. I love it and give 5 stars for the workout, but minus two stars because the price point of the membership is too high in regards to my use level and the value I get from it, so in the end I’ll pass on this app. I get why they set it high—music royalty fees, paid coaches, the amazing environments, and a new workout every day. But the workouts don’t vary that much anyway. I wish the developers would make a way around the membership fee and create a SUPERNATURAL MINI. Give me thirty workouts total and charge a flat rate for the game. Make them 15 minutes long with about 4 music tracks and you can quit between if you want a shorter workout or do another one when you want a longer workout. Then have in-app purchases so you can purchase more option packages if you want. For what Supernatural is right now, I think they’re losing a huge audience.  After my trial ends, I’ll stick to Beat Saber and just make my swings harder, wider, and squat lower. I’ll miss the environments of Supernatural, but I’m not willing to pay a monthly fee for them."
1983,Psalm.Daughter,"Jan 6, 2021 at 8:46 PM",5,Really Fun and Motivational,"Beautiful scenery. Multiple genes of music, including classical. Inspirational for someone so hates to work out.

1984,Rob,"Jan 2, 2021 at 7:34 PM",5,Game Changer!,"This ""game"" is incredible.  Me, my wife, and my daughter ""play"" it every day as a component to our exercise routines.  It is capable of providing an intense cardio workout with heart rates above 85% max. you can burn 1000 calories an hour depending on your individual effort and fitness level.  I prefer it over Beat Saber but would love to see a couple improvements.  1. give us the ability to see our favorite workouts listed by rating.  2. let us compile or customize our own tracklist workouts and 3. have multiple difficulties of the same song that we could choose from when customizing these workouts.  
we have started to see some hanging and latency issues crop up but haven't determined if it's our internet service, game servers overloaded, or the Headset itself.  overall though this is our favorite thing to do on our Quest2.  we spend over 3 hours a day playing it.  Great Job!"
1985,aks2k,"Jan 10, 2021 at 2:17 AM",3,Good but fees and music are deal breaker,This is my first fitness program on VR and I like it. It is exciting and motivating. Visuals are really awesome. I feel there are 2 issues here. First is the monthly cost. It is just too much. I would prefer one time cost model with predefined routines to choose from. Another issue is the music. There should an option to plug-in something like Spotify so that I can stream in my own music.
1986,JuneyBugger,"Feb 7, 2021 at 10:18 PM",5,,Love this game. It is so fun and a great workout. Wish they had more country songs. Some Johnny Cash would be great.

It's easy to get your ""steps"" in while using Supernatural .... move your feet during the workout! I step when playing most exercise or rhythm games to hit my step goal and to help improve coordination.

Not a fan of the new fantasy landscapes and it would be nice to be able to create my own workout ""playlist"" but am happy with the app so far. Keep up the great work!"
1988,sharon38,"Jan 28, 2021 at 3:06 AM",3,Fee is too high,I like the work out but they should have different tiers of membership.

I wouldn't mind if the coaches gave you tips for the workout during the warmup and then shut up and let you enjoy it, but I would much rather play Beat Saber because I can enjoy the music and the workout without all the irrelevant chatter. Add the ability to mute them, and I would definitely subscribe. This app actually makes working out fun. And I hate working out."

Especially not like a wannabe bad radio DJ.

2005,Tiger Lily,"Jan 17, 2021 at 1:36 AM",2,It’s alright but...,"I would say the 20 dollar month to month payment is a little much. I know, I know “you need to think about the cost for developing, producing, and the trainers making new content” but I think for an application like this, it’s good, just not $20/month good. I think $10 even $15 would be more reasonable. The workouts are moderate at best and are sometimes hard to follow because it is off beat sometimes. Not only that, but sometimes I simply am not able to hit the targets because they are out of reach or the tracking seems off. (Beat saber operates right on point) It’s straight forward but it’s the same every time and gets boring.  I wish they would track when you miss or mess up too because it feels like it doesn’t matter if I actually try or not. Like a landscape beat saber (though beat saber is still more visually appealing). I wish there was an option to turn off the voice trainer (yet you can turn off sfx and music all the way?) I perform better without the voice in the background. Also, I wish they had single songs that you could compile into a custom playlist because when I exercise I hope to enjoy every song, not just some. Also I’d prefer getting to complete a workout without the cool down with the trainer because it doesn’t do much and it feels unnecessary."

2015,May,"Dec 20, 2020 at 10:43 AM",5,Great way to stay motivated!,"I workout to Supernatural 3-4 times a week now.  Really enjoy the spectacular scenery, fun music (across multiple genres), and motivating coaches to guide you through proper warm ups and cool downs. Hitting those targets were so satisfying and I can choose from Low, Medium, or High intensity (depending on how I feel that day). I also like seeing new forms getting released (leg lifts) in addition to squats and side lunges to keep things interesting.  I don’t mind the fees since it is more reasonable than gym membership and I don’t have to leave the house to get great workouts in each day. I do recommend getting silicon cover for your face mask though since you can get sweaty!"

The only thing that may make me stop using this app is not being able to turn down the trainers voices more than 50%.   I don’t mind workout related assistance, but the constant random motivational speak is a bit much.  Why have these great songs if someone is repeating over and over to find the light in my daily life?  I’m not trying to find God, I’m trying to work off a pizza.  I feel like the trainers should be utilized to give advice or tips for the workout.  Not sure how hard it would be to trigger assistance if you miss a bunch of balloons in a row or not lunging far enough.  I am still enjoying it though and can really feel a difference!"

Its nice being able to set up mulitple accounts, but we could only install the game on one headset per account.
The music is great, but l hope they put in a clean option for people who dont want to hear bad language. 
Having a real person stand before you everyday is great, l would like to see more time doing streches and even the option to do a work out following the training in the great settings.
Multi player would be nice to add more motivation
Would like to see scores for each hit in the game like other games, so we could replay the work out and try and beat the score and give us an idea of how well we are doing in the game.
l would be happy to pay a monthly fee, but l expect more then other games that only charge a one time fee. At this point l dont see that, but hopeful things will change and more will be offered or it will switch to a one time fee."
2023,AeolianEmpress,"Jan 6, 2021 at 10:20 PM",4,Good but could be great,"I just started my free trial and the workouts are so much fun! Like other reviewers, I started with Beat Saber, but this has more moves and doesn’t start you over if you just want to work out. I especially like that it scores you on power as well as accuracy, and the levels are well designed. You can opt out of doing squats and lunges if you need to, and I especially like the fact that it makes you move in the full 3-D space and not just forward facing. 

Here’s where it loses me: I want the option to turn off the trainer voices completely and just do the workout on my own with good music and beautiful scenery - I totally understand why a lot of people like it, but for me the constant chatter is super distracting and took me out of the immersion. Periodic reminders to breathe and notes on form are one thing, but there was barely a moment in the ones I tried that someone wasn’t talking! I tried just turning the trainer voice volume all the way down, but the lowest it will go is to about a third of the bar. 

I had also hoped for the ability to create custom playlists out of their music library. Additionally, I found this app by searching for yoga, but there aren’t any yoga routines! (I imagine this could get tricky with a bulky headset on, but at least a few non-inverted routines would be awesome.)

In conclusion: even if you hate working out, you’ll like this, but if you’re put off by constant background talking on top of music like I am, you might lose patience with it. I’ll keep exploring during my free trial, but devs if you’re reading this, if you can add the option to remove the trainer voice, you’ll absolutely get my subscription money!"
2024,Fun,"Oct 10, 2020 at 3:15 AM",5,Well worth the subscription.,"I had given up thinking any equipment purchased, or groups I joined, or videos, or gaming videos to make excercise appealing would work. My son brought a Quest headset home and I trialed Supernatural.  Long story short I found my waistline again! Someone actually checked me out for the first time after becoming invisable in my 50’s! I really stuck with it too! Not like the tredmill. The only exercise I get on that is dusting it. Supernatural is so addictive! I do feel like an athlete now! Not giving it up. Lost 18 pounds so far. I havent been able to budge my weight in 10 years. The scenery is fantastic, it’s so much fun. There’s a lot of motivation and some meditations. The music is great. Something for everyone.

Paying for it is actually making me use it more. If you want to add something to your arsenal of exercise apps I think it's worth the price in the long run."

Listening to my favorite 80s while focusing on working out with my form and strikes, tapped into the bygone era of my life. It’s more than just a work out with entertainment, I feel young again! I have hope that there is so much more for me in my life. Did you know it work out could do that? I know this might sound corny and I’m probably reading way more into it than there is, but as a 51-year-old who is beginning to think about the final segment of my life, this couldn’t have come at a better time for me. I HIGHLY recommend this app to anyone who wants a fun way to work out but still have the coaching inputs to help you do it safely and correctly. This is so much fun you forget you're working out!"

This is truly a motivating exercise app that leaves me with good vibes every time. The music is far more varied and to my liking, the scenery is fantastic, and the coaches are excellent. Every member of my family that has a headset is hooked and the gift certificates will make excellent Christmas presents. Even my wife and daughter in law, who expressed no interest in VR before, have turned out to be the most dedicated Supernatural fans."

Loads of fun.
Only have two complaints...
Subscription Price seems a bit high...

The Calibration is a bit off sometimes.
You can recalibrate to your height as much as you want, but who wants to find out in the middle of a workout that the squat height is too low for your 6 ft frame.
Other than that, good stuff.
Can’t wait for a broader selection of music as well.

2041,Wrathchild,"Dec 10, 2020 at 5:57 PM",5,Most fun cardio workout in VR,"The fun doesn't stop. I have been using the app daily for 2 weeks now and look forward to the new workout every day. And if it is a music genre I am not interested in, no worries there are plenty of others to choose from. I have set up my favorites and can go back to them easily. Coaches add a personal trainer element to it with thier professional commentary and humor. 

The environments are amazing! From mountain tops to crystal clear lakes to wonders of the world, doing a workout on a virtual platform slightly above the ground in these locations is simply breathtaking. Then the workout itself shows you the full 360° view so you can enjoy it. 

The competitive individual will strive to increase the score. Accuracy and power of hitting the targets becomes the goal of each workout. Add in a leaderboard from a very active community along with thier encouragement and you really do have a virtual gym with group fitness. 

The companion app is a great addition as well, allowing you to review different workouts and bookmark them for use in game and the social link with other users. The positive reinforcement from others really does help!

The monthly subscription, while I have not finished my free trial yet, I will not have an issue with this. The new content is worth it. This isn't different than purchasing music packs for other hit target apps, except you get great variety. From classical to rap to indie rock and 80's hair bands! The new environments never ceases to amaze either. 

One improvement to think about is the feedback in game. I would like to see a little more feedback on power hits in the workout to help figure out the scoring on this. Along with some feedback from the coaches when you are not performing well or when you already are doing well on the power the coach isn't asking for more.  

For new users, consider getting on the Facebook group as it really does add to the experience and builds the Supernatural community."
2042,Gina,"Dec 9, 2020 at 10:28 PM",5,Fun workout!,"I play Supernatural pretty much every day, it is a good way to get some exercise and feel like you're outdoors on a winter day. Would love to see some additional functionality worked into the platform, though. For example, allowing players to build a custom workout by combining playlists and being able to delete and mix & match songs to create an individualized workout playlist. Also, being able to seamlessly skip the cool down and begin another workout would be great. I finish a workout and generally want to go right into another one, but doing so is tedious. Currently I have to exit the game, then hit resume, then End Workout to start another set of songs, while having to repeat the trainer spiel and stretches, etc. before the first song. Maybe a ""jump to next workout"" function option to skip the cooldown and go into the first song of another playlist would work. Otherwise, LOVE this game!"

Looking forward to keep working out with it...for $20 a month, come on guys....how can you go wrong."
2044,Lirona,"Dec 31, 2020 at 10:02 AM",4,Why I LOVE it & what needs to be better,"AMAZING STUFF. It’s hard to get me engaged working out - most of time I just wait till it’s over - but this game has made working out so FUN!! I really love it. Both my husband and I play, and I really love that they sent us the headset sweat cover, nice touch. I think the pricing is super fair - specially when you have more than 1 person using it. 

Why I gave it 4 stars- notes to the amazing devs :

01 - The workouts can be improved, and I’m sure will over time - some songs are just really weird to move to in that speed and the pace is off - the EDM tracks are perfect and suite this medium really well - I really hope you’ll add alot more intense EDM and general electronic music as it’s the one that really make you jump around and hit STRONG ( also, HITT STRONG haha) I found all the nostalgic 90’s and movie themes just off it terms of pace and intensity. 

02 - The app has crushed on me a few times and that’s THE WORST thing when you’re in the middle or end of a workout and you don’t get the satisfaction of finishing it. It wasn’t once or twice and it’s becoming a real issue. I’ll be patient with it but if this persist it might become a problem. 

03 - Lastly I think you should add more ways to see your friends scores, challenge people, “battle it out” and most importantly see more trends and challenges for yourself - this will get users super hooked and motivated to work out every day. I love that you’ve  gamify the gym, now I think you need to take that part to the next level. This is THE BEST."

Great workout. Awesome popular music. Live coaches. Warm ups, cool downs, stretching and meditation- this app has it all! Don’t get me wrong - beat saber and audio trip are both fun and give you exercise - but If you’re looking for a curated full body workout, this will meet your needs!

2048,No,"Dec 30, 2020 at 3:00 AM",3,"Promising, but not worth the money yet","Supernatural seems very promising. It’s higher quality than most of the other fitness apps on Oculus, and it’s the only app I’ve found that offers a full body workout on par with a class at the gym. That said... it still has some annoying bugs to fix and some features to add before it’ll be worth $20 a month, IMHO. 

One thing I really don’t like is that they’ve tied workout intensity to gameplay difficulty. That is, if you want a high-intensity workout, then you’d better be an expert BeatSaber player, otherwise you have no hope of hitting half the targets. Conversely, if you want a lower level of gameplay difficulty, then your only option is a low-intensity workout that’ll barely make you break a sweat. There should definitely be multiple difficulty levels for each workout, regardless of the workout intensity."
2049,AngryGreek,"Jan 2, 2021 at 1:19 PM",4,"It's fun, but...","I tried some low intensity and medium intensity workouts. I like this app, however I don't actually like the coaches very much. I don't resonate with them and find them a bit cringy. I would gladly pay a one time purchase for this app, but a subscription is out of the question for me. I just don't think that kind of monetization works for this type of thing, at least not for me.

I personally don't think the coaches add much and I would prefer just the balloons and music."

In response: it’s not even close to being comparable your price point is still way to high. Sounds like you might have a bit of an overhead issue. Maybe you need to consider a purchased content option that doesn’t change and does not require constant input from trainers. There are a lot of fitness options out there I like using my oculus a couple times a week but can get similar gaming fitness on other games. I’m just saying if you want to go for the monthly option that’s your choice but your missing out on a lot of potential users. $20 a month is a stretch. its well built beautiful and a good work out (for fitness gaming) good luck glad you’re getting subscribers I just don’t think it’s wort $20 a month IMHO hence the review."
2053,GrimReaper,"Jan 30, 2021 at 7:18 AM",3,Crashes,"Sure it would be good but on quest 2 app crashes in tutorial stage and can't get past the ""your holding bats in your hands, now lets give it a try"" part."
2054,SandraTheConfused,"Dec 5, 2020 at 6:06 AM",5,Love this app! (Quest 1),"I wasn't too sure about this when I first started using it.  I found the coach voices talking over the music to be very stressful and too distracting, but it was much better when I lowered the voice volume to 50%.

It's a better full-body workout than any of the other apps I've tried, and it uses a great variety of music (Beat Saber and the rest of them seem to assume that nobody over the age of 25 uses VR).  

I have arthritis in my knees, so the ability to set the triangles (for squats and lunges) to what I can actually do is a big help and (combined with my physical therapy exercises) it's actually improving my flexibility.

The coaches are awesome - and that's something I never thought I'd hear myself say. There's a new workout (or meditation) every day. It's also helpful to be able to choose between low, medium, and high intensity workouts. 

The 44-minute ""turkey-buster"" workout this week was awesome - more of those, please! 

Supernatural is now my go-to daily exercise app. I still use Beat Saber and Audio Trip for variety some days, but I use this one every day. 

The one change I'd like to see in the short term is with the triangles. I sometimes find it difficult to see which way I'm supposed to lunge until it's right on top of me, especially when it's a series of triangles together. Perhaps thickening the line on the shorter side would help? 

As others have suggested, more variety (in addition to batting at targets) would be nice in the future, as well as full-body tracking when the technology supports it.

Overall, it's a great app, and worth the subscription fee for me."
2055,Sleepless,"Dec 30, 2020 at 10:22 PM",2,Basically Beat Saber,"Beat Saber was one of the first games I ever installed on my Oculus Quest 2, and I absolutely loved it! Later I installed this game on it and noticed some extreme similarities. The basic premise is the exact same as what you would find in Beat Saber, you hold one colored weapon in each hand (in this case, a black bat and a white bat) and you slice through the colored shapes that match your weapon colors in the direction that they point to match the beat to background music. There are only a few differences in this game, like the fact that you have to pay a monthly fee, while in Beat Saber you only have to buy the game. A few other differences include the environment you play in and there are workout coaches. On the other hand, the coaches are very encouraging. I also enjoy the stunning workout environments you can play in. Overall, I would recommend purchasing Beat Saber instead."
2056,Mr Filter,"Nov 3, 2020 at 2:01 AM",5,"Making me stick to my workouts, fun","*** Updated after contacting with Supernatural VR Support ***

I am writing this review as a military veteran, software engineer, and dad who has struggled to enjoy working out while in COVID lockdown.

The Good
• great music
• coaches are personable and likable
• effective workouts where you burn a lot calories
• great scenery
• it is actually fun to workout again

The Areas of Improvement
• update the minimum age to 13 to reflect the minimum age for Facebook and Oculus as the profile setup flow limits users to 18+. It would be great if Supernatural could be used by teens. This would add a lot of benefit to families during COVID lockdown. 
• reduce the monthly cost to $5-$10/person. I don’t want to share my Oculus with everyone in my household (yuck). The whole profiles thing really doesn't make much sense to me. At $20 per device, you will turn away a larger pool of potential customers.
• add ability to mute coaches
• have coaches focus comments away from worldview or ideology. It's a turnoff to constantly hear ""love yourself. If you don't, who will?"". (Leanne has been awesome with her comments. They are really encouraging and do focus on getting the right mindset to push through the workouts)
• focus comments on encouraging to complete workouts in a safe manner (Again, Leanne, you are doing this.)
• add other workout types, if possible (kick boxing, plyo, etc)

Great job with the app so far. I want to keep it long term, but we are paying $40/month for it to work for us in a family on two devices. We would love for our teens to be able to use the app. At this price point, my wife is considering dropping it and sticking with a combination of Beat Saber and a few other apps. Perhaps the $20 per month plan could be a premium option to hear the premium music, while other plans had indie songs that cost less to obtain rights for use."

Games like BeatSaber is a lot of fun but I lost interest. FitXr seemed like fun and a nice workout and if Supernatural didn't exist then I'd probably use FitXr. What keeps me going back to Supernatural are the coaches. There are 3 different coaches that talk to you while working out. Each coach offers a different perspective on life and working out. I like to listen to them and focus on my workout. They make the minutes fly by and I love their inspirational and motivating messages. The views are gorgeous and I've been to places I never knew existed on this planet! I can't get enough is Supernatural! I love being able to log in each day and have a new workout to choose with different lengths and intensity levels. Calling it software or a game doesn't do it justice.

subscription fee is almost the same as gym however this is far from being the same as going to gym, gym has much more varieties including and not limited to weight lifting 
all their feedback on this is we have coaches bla bla bla, what if I do not work with a coach!!!
even gyms give u an option to work alone or with a coach 
I wouldn’t spent that much money for nothing compared to gym subscription, thank you I can do such aerobics in many other ways and I am expert enough not to work with a coach!

the application itself is great, nice music and scenes, but with the current payment modle it doesn’t deserve more than 2 stars, I would give higher rating when they offer different payment options like lifetime subscription or working without coaches, etc"

2068,Koyamasan,"Dec 20, 2020 at 9:54 AM",4,So far so great!,"Just started my trial but I am pleasantly surprised.  My gym just shut down and my membership is frozen so subscribing will be a no brainer once my trial is over since it’s half the price of my gym.  Once the temperature really drops I think Supernatural will be my only cardio outlet since my gym is closed for the foreseeable future.   I feel that  the great music, landscapes and excellent instructors are well worth the fee.  Plus my wife can use it.  She enjoys the meditation classes.   I enjoy the chatter from the instructors since it reminds me of in person group classes.   I wish it supported my Fitbit but otherwise I think it’s a great stress reliever and cardio work out.  Thanks developers!"
2069,Alan,"Dec 27, 2020 at 10:59 PM",2,Dangerous pseudo-free trial,"Supernatural does not actually have a 30-day free trial. To go beyond the brief tutorial, this pseudo-trial requires you to enter credit card information. This may be splitting hairs and open to interpretation; some people may feel fine about giving out their credit card info for something ""free "". But in this day and age of hacking and inadvertent customer data loss, it doesn't seem right to me. If you decide not to continue with supernatural, and either forget to cancel or can't figure out how to cancel after a month You will still be charged even if you do not use the app. This seems conniving to me.

Looking at the introductory tutorial, which is all you can get if you don't give them your credit card, this app seems like a I very well produced exercise VR app. I really appreciate the beautiful 360° nature settings they use.

Nonetheless, I suggest just saying NO to this revenue model where they hang onto your credit card data before even allowing you to go beyond the tutorial and get to an actual trial."

I now look forward to working out on a daily basis at home, I never experienced this before, primarily because its fun, the surroundings and locations are visually stunning and the music is fantastic with so much variety to keep you going. I'm waiting with great anticipation for the Oculus move option to keep track of my time and calories burned."
2072,JM,"Dec 18, 2020 at 9:25 PM",3,Great when it works,"As much as I want to love this app it is a chore to use.  It has the distinction of being the most expensive app and the least reliable.   No other game I have is as glitchy as this one.  Instead of adding new features the developers should be working to make the core features work flawlessly every time especially at this price point.  It is frustrating to spend 5-10 minutes just to get started because of freezes, no audio track, etc.  which requires me to quit the game and reboot the headset, sometimes multiple times.  That said I still manage to get in a few workouts every day and will continue to do so because I’ve already paid however when renewal time rolls around I will probably not renew if it doesn’t get more reliable."
2073,JohninNL,"Dec 7, 2020 at 10:46 PM",5,Expensive but great app,"It's basically beat saber if all beat saber tracks where focused on fitness and had a lot more leg work.

2074,Gordon Ryan,"Dec 17, 2020 at 4:38 AM",4,Great app with greater potential,"I got my Quest 2 specifically to use Supernatural to get some exercise during the pandemic. I have been mostly pleased. Although pricey with the subscription model, I find it fun and exciting to use and it keeps me motivated to work out. The scenes are gorgeous and the workouts use upper and lower body. Many have compared it to Beat Saber but Beat Saber emphasizes coordination and speed more than fitness. My most serious complaint is that the app can be glitchy. Perhaps one in five workouts the app simply doesn't advance to the next scene in the middle of a wrkout sequence. It remains stuck in a scene with nothing to do but quit the app and try again, erasing the progress and forcing me to rpeteat the entire workout if I'd like to resume where I was in the workout. Other than that, less repetition of scenes and more invented scenes (I;'d like to see some Lord of the Rings universe scenes personally) would be cool."

2078,Aariny,"Dec 1, 2020 at 10:32 AM",3,There are better alternatives,"The app and environment are great. I loved loading into the scenic environments. It was also great having an actual coach during your workout. 

I ended up doing the app for two weeks 3x a day. I found that I wasn’t burning what I normally do in a workout. I didn’t feel like I was working harder then in beat saver. It felt a lot easier then the other days of the week when I was doing non VR workouts. I also got bored.

A friend recommended another fitness app. It had a one time fee and I’m still using it over a month later. The difference is astounding to me. I’m glad I didn’t pay the membership fee. I would rather buy the core app and then buy expansion packs as needed then this subscription model."
2079,Kevin,"Oct 30, 2020 at 9:45 PM",5,Fantastic coaching,"I'm an expert beatsaber player - the crafting that's gone into this game is great though.  There are tons of free levels with new ones out all the time.  The individual coaching is really fun, the life-size VR quality to it all feels very motivating to me.  It's quite a workout too, you have to try - there's not much an emphasis on score or anything, but it's very inspiring and I've been enjoying it.

A unique experience to the quest and I hope it's here for a very long time."

2081,omtigger,"Nov 23, 2020 at 7:07 AM",5,Worth the subscription,"I am not very fit and needed a game that would help me exercise without half killing me. Supernatural has already helped me build my fitness in only a month. It offers low, medium, and high-impact workouts, and the low-impact workouts were great for me to start. I have moved into the shorter medium workouts and I'm proud of my progress. I find it helpful to work out to music I know and like, rather than generic music. I feel more enthusiastic and play this game longer than other games. For the sake of the licensed music, it's worth the subscription to me. 

One suggestion I have for developers is to add longer workouts, maybe in the 30-45 minute range. Right now I string 2 or 3 workouts together - which isn't the end of the world! - but it would be nice to just stay in the groove for the whole workout. Thanks for a great app!"
2082,DoktorDeath,"Nov 7, 2020 at 2:10 AM",5,"Totally worth it! Fun Gym ""Membership""!","I am a physician and want to try and stay in shape.  Thanks to COVID, I really cannot go to the gym at this time.  However, I am glad that I finally tried Supernatural!  I can get some cardio and have some fun at the same time.  

Raneir Pollard is my favorite trainer.  He is so funny and has outstanding musical taste!  I think that I have favorited most of his stuff, so that I can get to it quckly.  Checkout his October 31, 2020 workout - hilarious (and maybe mildly spooky)!

The music, scenery, and workouts are all great.  I can't believe that I can even enjoy working out to classical music - who knew?  

I am so impressed that they come out with a new workout every day and now they have an impressive library.  

I also love the way Supernatural easily pairs with my apple watch through an app to track my heart rate and give me stats with each workout.  (The puddles of sweat on the floor tell me I am working hard, but I like seeing my heart rate and all the other Supernatural data too!).  

My wife is the one who tried Supernatural first and she got me into it.  What a great deal that for the membership price, we can both use the same headset and track our progress separately on our phone/watch.  If you are going to share an Oculus headset, I strongly recommend that you buy an additional face pad, so that you can replace your sweaty face pad before your partner(s) use it!  

The price for Supernatural is totally worth it for the excellent fun workouts, killer licensed music, beautiful scenery, and professional trainers.  Thank you Supernatural Team for making fitness fun!!!!"

2085,magicismight92,"Sep 2, 2020 at 7:59 PM",5,Great addition to my fitness journey!,"A lot of the negative reviews seems to be from people who have missed the point of this particular app and are not the intended target audience. This is not even close to being a Beat Saber clone, which is obvious to anyone who has actually played SN and not just made a snap judgement based on gameplay footage. Anyone who has actually played both games would know that BS and SN are very different, besides the basic game mechanics. I play BS when I want to have fun. I play SN when I want a legit workout. I consider SN a workout app and people who “play” this and expect something else are not the target audience. This is meant to be a WORKOUT, not a casual game.

I am in the process of losing weight and have been wanting a simple low-high intensity cardio workout that I can do without having to leave my home especially during the pandemic. SN has been the perfect solution for me. It’s been a great addition to my diet. I even cancelled my gym membership since this app accomplishes the same thing, but in the comfort of my living room and way more fun. I highly recommend this to people who are looking for a great *workout* app, for weight loss or just wanting to be healthier. There are tons of playlists with different themes and genres, a great variety of music that refreshes constantly, and the coaches are great. The price might be considered “steep” for some folks, but it’s cheaper than a gym membership and well worth it if you are actually the intended audience (unlike many of the negative reviews). You probably spend more on a takeout meal every month, so I don’t buy the “price is too high” complaint if you intend to use this app the way it was meant to be used."

2089,Paulo,"Oct 20, 2020 at 6:51 AM",5,Just one word: Awesome!,This is one of the reasons why I bought a quest 2. I signed in to this app with an open mind without any expectation. I just finished my first intermediate level workout and let me tell you.... I'm half dead LOL . The amount of calories I burned on one single session 250 kcal is half of what I used to burn when doing CrossFit which is insane considering I'm at home and paying a fourth of the price. I'm committed to do two sessions per day to achieve my goals. I can't wait to see my body a couple months from today. One peace of advice to the developers: please add Fitbit to the list of fitness watches within the app. I also agree with the comment below for those who complain about the monthly fees. With such a powerful content and energetic workouts it's more than fair. You would pay Waaay more at any gym and not necessarily like it.
2090,Leanne Lamb,"Nov 19, 2020 at 3:07 PM",5,I love this program!,I understand that the subscription may be a turn off for some but for me it's worth every penny.

I like how they put out new workouts daily and so far it's never boring and the music is awesome!

For what I’m looking for, this game nailed it. I want to sweat. I mean, REALLY SWEAT. I want to feel like I just burned a lot of calories. Bottom line: supernatural is a real exercise game.

Music selection — if you love edm, top 100 mainstream songs, this game has it all. Hip hop, pop, rock, you name it. I got so into the ablicious workout, and ALL of the choices of songs for that session are so so good!! Beat saber, limited with purchase option if you want BTS, Imagine Dragon, Linkin Park - all of which are really cool too. At the end of the day, I feel like for what I’m looking for, this game beats best saber any day.

Bottom line, bottom line - you want to sweat? Get this game. No regrets. I understand there’s membership fees - you get what you paid for. A gym membership at home with pretty awesome coaches."

The app is great, but the fact that we can't mute or even turn down trainer volume below 50% is beyond absurd. The trainer often shares more than needed and it can get really awkward at times (no I don't care that this song reminds you of your teenage years... No I don't want to be your prom date). It's really distracting and making me miss the cones. There are times I basically just shut off my Quest without finishing the exercisebecause I just can't stand trainers talking all over the music.

Everything else is great and this app would early be 5 stars if I can mute trainer's voice."

2097,Mike,"Oct 12, 2020 at 8:54 PM",5,"A real workout, different every day.","I have been using Supernatural for few months now and it's been enormously beneficial for my well-being. before COVID shut LA down, I would take group fitness classes every day at my gym. That hour was a huge part of my life! Supernatural goes a long way in providing aspects of that fitness experience--the teachers are all really great, the coaching always seems to come at the perfect time, and you really get the sense that you are part of a community--heck, it even got me to log back into Facebook to join the (very positive, very supportive) Supernatural group.

The fee is cheap compared to a regular gym membership (at least here in LA) and the workouts are real--these legit cardio workouts. (The app pairs with your Apple Watch so you can track your calories, which is great a feature absent on other Oculus apps that I have tried.) I have tried most of the workouts and it's a relief to report that ""Hard"" is legitimately *hard*.  I literally have to drap towels all around my office because I sweat so much--I even, no joke, have set off my (admittedly old) fire alarm three times during the workouts, I guess because I was adding so much moisture in the air?!!? This is not a game--it's a workout product. 

A few things:
- the teachers are all great, super supportive, and I have laughed outloud quite a few times during my workouts
- this is a 360° play area, so you will want to make sure you have enough room around you--I broke a controller when I hit a bookshelf
- you definitely need to stretch and if you have tight hips, be patient, there are a lot of side lunges here

I admit, I find it weird to tell people that my favorite workout is on my Quest, but that's 2020 for you.  If you want to get in shape...check this out. Just give it a try and see what you think. 

 I use it at least 3-4 times a week, it's well worth the monthly fee--it helps pay the teachers and choreographers -- and secures actual songs for your workout.  Well worth it.

Have fun!"

The workouts are so much fun, I find myself wanting to do more as soon as I finish. The ""quick hit"" workouts are great for that. 

Locations are stunning, the music is energizing and the workouts seem like they have a lot of replay potential. There are also meditations and stretching. I've tried on meditation so far and really enjoyed it.

I already subscribe to Dailyburn, so I hesitated at the price, but they're very different, and since signing up I find myself doing both, one AM, one PM. It's seriously helping with stress.

Still in the (generous) free trial period, but I'm hooked. Highly, highly recommend.

**UPDATE**
I've been using this app daily for weeks, and I will happily pay for the subscription. The coaches are excellent and these workouts are clearly carefully designed with helpful coaching cues. Every pattern has purpose, maximizing movement with no impact.

And you're having too much fun to care.

It is absolutely worth the subscription fee, you are getting professional, intentionally structured workouts with great music (licensing costs) and spectacular locales. And it works for all fitness levels. Definite keeper."
2103,Elcomodin,"Oct 13, 2020 at 7:52 PM",1,(Updated) scam with payments,"(Updated again)
They scammed me out of US$100 by not cancelling the subscription on their website
(Updated after more playing time) 
I’ve been working out daily on oculus quest and love it. Was excited about this app.
It has a couple of great things don’t get me wrong:
- nice workout 
- it connects with app and Iwatch which was long due. 

Cons:
- at Us$20 per month, US$240 per year plus taxes I will definitely stay with box VR and saber. 
- subscription is complex on their website
- the coaches are kind of annoying, get cool music and that’s it. 
- landscapes are ok but sometimes feels too much like the 3D posters at a Chinese restaurant 
- you need quite some space. But the workout is good
- loading times can be long
- besides expensive it only covers one person. To people in the same house playing and it’s almost US$500 per year...

Once other apps let you connect the health trackers to it (and considering the Bluetooth option on oculus quest it should be soon) I think this app it’s really.

Suggestion to the developers create a lifetime subscription this initial period like trippp did. Still an initial version with a good concept. it Has potential but clearly not at this price. Charge $39.99 once and every once in a while get some add ons and could be worth it."

What I mean is that I very much enjoy hiking, bike riding, going for walks with friends, dancing... Doing fun things that also happen to involve exercise, but I have never been the type to enjoy going to the cardio class at the local gym.   I really like this!  I will do this!

The variety of locations/scenery, playlists/genres, intensities and length of workouts are amazing. But what really hooked me is the coaches and community. The support, inspiration, uplifting and challenging that you get from them is out of this world. If you do go with Supernatural, definitely join the Facebook group!

I have wanderlust & being transported to some of the most beautiful environments is exciting & feeds my soul! You will manage a satisfying sweat & all within your own home, on your time schedule. I normally get motion-sick, but with the 'Comfortable' setting, I am able to participate in exercise. I love the fact there's a daily workout, with a variety of difficulty levels, with the guidance of 3 super-encouraging coaches (Leanne, Coach Doc, & Raneir). The program is being constantly improved based on their program participants' suggestions. For example, meditation & stretching routines have been recently added. There's a variety of upbeat music, which even includes some classical numbers! You won't be disappointed...you have nothing to lose (except an annual fee & your weight) & everything to gain (muscle, energy, confidence & motivation)! Take a chance on yourself...your well-being is important & feeling stronger will allow you to take better care of those around you. Make this a priority...it can be life-changing. Good luck!"

Each workout is a set of multiple songs with custom warmups and cooldowns which as you can imagine takes a lot of work to put up. Anyways, I’ve done just a few workouts on here and I can promise it’s a way better workout than Beat Saber with comparable levels of fun.

UPDATE: Still going strong after several months. If you’re unsure about whether to get it, there’s a free trial as well. Anyways, after joining the group’s Facebook and Discord, I’d say that the Supernatural community is so great that I’d place it on the list of reasons to get the game, as well.

2. What’s the point of having a coach if they don’t show you how to move those triangles. I am sure we gotta squat but sometimes it’s very difficult when we have small and side squats to do. I don’t want to bar myself by doing it in a wrong way. I want the coaches to show how they do it so we know we are doing it in the right way. Otherwise it just feels like a hand work out   Mag be the coach can do a 2-3 minute of the workout showing how they move their body"

2116,Brandon,"Nov 28, 2020 at 12:00 AM",4,"Great workouts, big improvements lately","Just 30 minutes in Supernatural gets my heart rate up and leaves me feeling spent as if I'd gone to the gym. I miss getting to work out with a trainer, so this is a decent replacement during the pandemic times. Yes, it has similar mechanics to Beat Saber, but the regular updates keep it fresh and you get multiple songs and new workouts every day. You can tell these are workouts with purpose rather than the dance-y movements of Beat Saber.

The previous version of the app would crash regularly, either failing to connect to the servers or outright locking up. Recent updates to the app have made it much more stable and reliable."
2117,Stradford,"Oct 14, 2020 at 2:57 AM",5,What a fantastic way to work out!,"First, it's so accessible. We're able to get a quality workout at any time with minimal gear and space. Second, I've always run to get a quality cardio workout, but worried about overusing joints and muscles. The variety of moves with Supernatural cuts down on repetitive actions and pounding. Third, it's a good time. The instructors are outstanding; motivating and engaged. Fourth, you can adjust Supernatural to make it challenging, even if you're a committed gym rat...you're get your sweat on. My wife has always worked out begrudgingly...now it's not unusual for her to get a second Supernatural workout in on the same day just because she had a good time -- Supernatural has helped her dramatically change her physique. . For us, this app is simply incredible."

First of all, I actually think the monthly fees are fine, it means the developers, trainers, and level designers have enough funding to keep creating fresh new content. I would rather pay a monthly fee than have stale content. 

Second of all the instructors help a lot. Having guiding commentary helps keep me motivated and gives pointers on the best form to use.

Thirdly I prefer the swinging mechanics ala beat saber/supernatural to the punching action of fitxr and audio shield. For some reason a lot of my punches would miss in fitxr especially the right and left hooks."
2122,Komei,"Oct 11, 2020 at 9:11 PM",5,Best immersive VR experience!,"Besides being the most fun and effective workout app (there are many reviews, which I agree with), I think Supernatural is the most immersive VR app that features beautiful landscape from around the world.  It's not just ""flat"" 360° pictures.  The scenes have depth (stereoscopic) and geometry.  You can move your head and look through the hole in the wall of the Great Wall of China or move within a few feet and walk around a rock in Machu Picchu.  Unlike the other ""video game"" kind of apps, the images are with highest resolution like in professional 360° cameras.  I have tried many other VR apps but I haven't seen this level of photogrammetry before.  Plus the images are from stunningly beautiful locations from all continents (maybe more than 50 spots so far?).  Seeing a new exotic location is exciting and it keeps me motivated to keep doing the workout every day."

Please thank your environment artists that are building those for me.  I love to travel, I love to workout, I love to have a personal trainer. Supernatural has it all."
2125,SakoTaco,"Oct 4, 2020 at 3:59 AM",5,My Most Used App on Oculus!,"Can't express enough how awesome this workout app has been, ESPECIALLY during this pandemic (and heatwave on the West Coast!) while all the gyms are closed. I had to purchase a face pad accessory and a sweatband JUST for this app because of how much I was sweating during these workouts. I'm in good shape, 5'11, 160lbs - I was going to the gym using weights and running 1-2 miles about 2-3 times per week - and Supernatural has got me huffing and puffing and even sore at times! I love it, can't say enough good things about it. All the trainers are great, the music is awesome, it's essentially a full body work out.... why are you still reading this.... buy it and get started!

One request.... it would be cool if the developers would let you flag or choose a particular song they used for a workout so that you can later replay just one song in particular, or even maybe create your own workout list with the ones you choose. Some songs have movements that I enjoy more than others and it would be cool if I could ""isolate"" those moves (for instance, I like the double hit to another portal bc it's a really good abdominal movement - so it would be cool to stack a bunch of songs that have those movements so I can focus on abs for a full workout)

Thanks Supernatural! Your app alone makes the oculus well worth having! (Peloton who?)"

2127,RabbitShire.com,"Sep 2, 2020 at 4:15 PM",5,My honest review,"When I first started Supernatural (SN), I hated the idea of the price tag for the subscription. I told myself I would do the thirty day trial and see if it was worth it. I came into it playing fitvr and beat saber for exercise and thought that SN would be similar. The intro, setting up the device was easy and made it feel custom to me. The first round I thought what the... The targets were a bit faster than I thought they should have been for my first round. After that first round I could barely go up my stairs because my legs were killing! Few days later I got on and I did better with the target. Legs killed again. This is AWESOME! Beat saber and fitvr faided away. 

Let's talk about money. What's your health worth? LOL. SN has a great non toxic community that inspires, challenges, and uplifts each other. With SN, you have coaches with unique personalities that are involved in the community and assist in the workout. The money doesn't just go to the music licensing but it also helps evolve the game. SN has had multiple big updates. The awesome part, they've been solid.

I would recommend SN over and over again."

But 179 dollars a year or 20 bucks a month?.... hard to do that when there are other amazing apps like fit rx that only charge a one time 25 dollar fee. You do get a 1 month free which is great.

This is not beat saber (which I love).  There are targets to hit, but it is designed to keep you moving, and work various muscles as you go.  

They have a wide variety of music, levels, and length or workouts.  The instructors are all enjoyable and add a gym class feel to the workouts as they encourage and instruct you.

 I’m glad I enrolled."
2133,tcheetam tchit,"Oct 14, 2020 at 3:03 PM",5,Life changer,"One of the biggest impediments to working out is dreading it.  That barrier is removed forever with Supernatural.  I was amazed how much I enjoyed this from the moment I tried it!  The backgrounds are great (but I would really like to see more, including some from the trailers).  

I have been doing it EVERY WEEKDAY AM for 5 weeks now and my blood sugar has been dropping like a rock!  I really like Leanne and ""Doc"" as their coaching styles fit my 60+ sensibilities (and I chuckle every time Leanne mentions her dad and ""his music"").

I stay at L with an occassional foray into M (maybe H in a few months?  Stay tuned!) and that works fine for me.  I work up a pretty good sweat and get the heart going.

If you have Oculus Quest and have been putting off getting off the couch, get started!  And if you like Saber you will LOVE Supernatural!

As for the fee: Cheaper than any gym or other workout option, especially if you use the annual option

2135,Alicia Wonderland,"Nov 18, 2020 at 11:22 PM",2,Overpriced and annoying coaches,"This is a good workout but has multiple issues.

1. Constantly freezes mid-workout. The developers are aware of this and working on it.
2. There is no way to mute the coaches who talk CONSTANTLY throughout the workout about ridiculous personal things like their problems in high school that have nothing to do with the workout or coaching. They literally babble on and on and you can’t enjoy the music if you actually find songs you like. You can only lower the volume of the coaches by 50% which is not enough.
3. You can’t listen to individual songs. There are set playlists and there is no way of skipping over songs you don’t like. It’s hard to find music you do like and when you do, it’s mixed with songs you may not like. You have no control. 
4. The monthly payment subscription is ridiculous especially considering all the flaws above.
5. You can only go 360, if you don’t have a lot of space, you can’t have it at 180.

On the positive side, it’s a good workout. If you have played any other rhythm game, it’s actually really easy to hit targets on the hardest mode, but it’s way more energetic and you burn more calories. Audio Trip is much harder to hit the targets but there is not as much movement. This is easy to hit targets and if you have good stamina, it’s easy to do well and get a good workout. If only they got rid of the coaches, let you create your own playlist of songs from the their library and charged a one time fee comparable to other workout apps, this could be 5 star."

2137,Xander,"Oct 10, 2020 at 8:17 PM",5,Pure VR workout joy!,"Supernatural makes it so easy and such a joy to simply jump into a workout. The experience as a whole simply ""clicks"" for me, with a great upbeat, happy vibe. I would never have believed that time can fly while working out.

Certainly, some VR games can be repurposed as exercise, with some effort, but at the end of the day, you're still trapped in someone's neon basement, practicing wrist flicks to dubstep by someone you've never heard of. Supernatural, meanwhile, isn't a game at all (and reviewing it as such it not just unfair, it utterly misses the point). It may offer somewhat gamified workouts and leaderboards, but those are closer in concept to e.g. Fitbit than to Beat Saber. It's all about fitness and flow. No fails, no leveling up, no stress.

For me personally, the monthly (or annual) fee is more than reasonable, given the amount of content that is constantly being added: daily new workouts since April, all featuring actual coaches with great personalities and a track library that must be well in the hundreds by now. The app is under very active development and has a very active community. Most importantly, I find it offers good value because it lowers my personal threshold for working out so much.

I would recommend anyone remotely interested to give the free trial a try."

If you love working out to music this is your jam. The workouts, anywhere from 7 minutes to 28 minutes, are on beat to a wide collection of classic and current music tracks. The trainers guide you through each workout and have various personalities that motivate and support you throughout your workout.

The movement vocabulary is much richer than any of the other workout apps (Beat Saber, BoxVR, Pistol Whip, etc.), so you train a fuller set of muscles moving in a greater variety of directions. After doing Supernatural, the movement in the other apps feels just a little bit... boring.

Yes, there's the higher (and on-going) cost compared to the others, but it's a steal compared to the cost of a gym membership, with which this competes. (Plus, gyms can be problematic during Covid anyway.) But for the fee, you're also getting a vast and seemingly endless variety of great music across many genres and hand-crafted workouts from the trainers.

Personally, my favorite weekly routine is interspersing Supernatural workouts at the ""High"" level on some days with going running outdoors on the others. My other family members have also joined in, and you can always tell when someone has finished a Supernatural workout because they come into the kitchen, dripping with sweat and smiling, to fetch a rag to wipe down the Oculus."

The ability to choose your intensity has been really nice, and the music selection has gotten a lot better and more diverse. I like that you can share a membership with family now too. 

I’ve really enjoyed using Supernatural especially during the lockdown and I find it so much easier to stick with than a regular gym workout because it’s just so much more FUN than running on the same treadmill or lifting the same weights over and over again. It’s really mentally stimulating, which makes it feel a lot more like a game than a workout, but don’t get me wrong, if you make the effort to really go for it, you’ll get your heart pumping and break a nice sweat.

You will sweat... a lot. You will find yourself making time to ""play"" and will miss it when you can't. The positivity and support that flows from the trainers, the SN team, and throughout the SN community is immense and addictive. Supernatural is **NOT** a Beat Saber ripoff; it takes a familiar concept, long-known to anyone that's ever swung a stick at a pinata or a wrapping paper tube in an imagined lightsaber duel, and turns it into a 360° action-packed experience. For hundreds of dollars less per year than joining a traditional gym or Xfit box, you can laugh, scream, curse, cry, and wiggle your wobbly bits in the safety of your own home, hotel room, or wherever you can pick up an internet signal; no judgements or face masks needed. This is one of the BEST workout apps you'll find on the market today and absolutely worth giving a shot. Heck, it's free for a month. What have you got to lose?"

2159,NinjaTovar,"Oct 10, 2020 at 2:18 AM",5,"Yes, It’s Too Expensive — I Still Did It","I agree with the reviews that the team is asking quite a heavy price. I think it is worth them asking themselves whether they would like more subscribers for a lower price or fewer with higher at the same profit margin.

Having said that, I love this application. My quest has sat fairly idle for a year until I tried this, now I’m on several times a week for one or two sessions with Leanne Pedante (? hope I spelled that right). They really have made fitness fun with this app!

Background time. I consider myself athletic, mostly cardio but some days are for strength and recovery or yoga. I am a distance runner, and at 6’ 185lbs that can be hard on my joints. When my body is telling me no on hitting the pavement, I know I can still put on my headset and pull up two twenty minutes “hard” sessions with Leanne and get my cardio in.

As a user with just enough disposable income to swallow the cost, I really love what team Supernatural has created and continues to bust out workouts for. They encourage you to not look at the cost as if it was an app, instead as if it was a membership to a studio — this is *kind of* acceptable. I’m not sure they will be able to survive on those laurels though. I adore this application and still have some buyers remorse on the price tag. 

Overall I’m unsure if I’ll subscribe to year two, but I do truly think this will improve or maintain people’s health in an entertaining way and love using it. 

P.S.: I’m not an EDM or metal head, but those workouts have been the hardest and most fun. Hopefully those get some more love as opposed to guilty pleasures, pop, or 80’s music for the “hard” category!"

I now find myself spending around 45 minutes, sometimes over an hour per day sweating my @$$ off. 
I put my headset on and I am transported to amazing location where I am squatting, lunging, swatting, and yet somehow also dancing along to great curated playlists. 
It doesn't hurt being motivated by an amazing group of trainers who are all actively involved with users on various social channels.

There isn't much else to say. The results come quick, and you don't even feel like you are exercising... I seriously look forward to my sessions every day, I never thought I'd me that guy.

To top it off, the app itself is constantly evolving for the better. The team is super receptive to criticism and suggestions, and often make changes based on users suggestions!

I'd pay twice as much monthly if I had to, it's THAT great.

2164,ChuckDino,"Oct 2, 2020 at 2:42 AM",5,The best workout you haven't tried yet,"You're probably like me, a bit of a geek because you own a VR headset you want to stay in shape, you don't want to be a mess. Maybe your spouse works out a lot and encourages you to do so also. Like I want to work out but I really don't want to work out.. you get me?
Gyms just crowded and monotonous. You start phoning your workout in.
Running is great but it's just stress and a lot of people dread it before it starts.
Maybe work out at home have a treadmill or elliptical and some weights.. what sort of workout are you really getting.
Enter supernatural... The perfect thing for the right space.
I typically work out somewhere between 4 to 6 days a week for about 90 minutes to 2 hours. A lot of that time is just cardio.
Tried supernatural just on a whim and it's now the way I start every workout. It makes me sweat like no machine does. I enjoy myself I enjoy the music and I actually feel the difference after.
Sure there is a fee but it cost money to go to a gym or buy equipment for your house. It's updated pretty regularly with new workouts and new music, so it doesn't get stale and you aren't doing the same old thing.
I can't recommend it enough. If the cost of monthly access scares you away.. just try it for a week everyday do a new workout.. I bet you like it and subscribe.

But man, I fell in love with it! The workouts are veeery fun and challenging and you get a brand new one every single day.The online comunity is AMAZING as well as the coaches that are also part of it.  The developers are constantly receiving feedback from the community and with that, they keep adding features to the app. 
Give it a try! You're gonna love it if you're looking to work out in a complete different way, break a good sweat (and believe me, YOU WILL!) and have fun! If you're just looking for a game, enjoy the free trial and go back to Beat Saver.

I've only being doing it for a month, but everyday without fail, eager to see what the workout of the day will be. Like a lot of reviewers, I don't understand the complaint about it being a monthly subscription considering how much content they put out each month, the royalties they must pay to musicians, and the fact you get a free month to see what the hype's about?!

2176,VMer_1.0.-SNAPSHOT,"Oct 20, 2020 at 6:27 AM",5,Enjoying the App More After Trial Period,"I wanted a one-time purchase with no trainers initially, but over time the trainers have grown on me.   
I like that this game doesn't try to be a game that is also exercise.  You don't win it or lose it.  You win by getting a good workout.  They style reminds me of older dance aerobics workouts that I used to love, but with stationary footing that is useful now that I have some injuries to work around.  This actually hits the thighs/glutes, which is unusual in a Quest fitness game. 

A few things that I'd like to see added are pre-loading of workouts, mix-and-match of songs into custom workout routines, and expansion of the song selection.   There are some songs that I like and would enjoy putting into my daily rotation.  I'd also like to be able to put together longer stretches of songs between one warm-up and cool-down.  Pre-loading to reduce that long delay between songs would also be great.  There is also a world of great 80s music with cheap licensing cost out there just waiting to be tapped for use in the game.

Otherwise, I'll probably get used to the monthly fee, because this is a very nice app."

We signed up for a second account because they do t have profiles yet (I understand they will be adding this feature soon though). We have each completed at least one Supernatural workout every single day for more than 8 weeks now. We've never been this consistent with working out before. We have the fitness gains to show how important consistency is.

Supernatural went well beyond what I was expecting when I first signed up. Quality is built in from top to bottom and they keep improving it. The beat maps are very thoughtfully done with rhythm, enjoyability, and fitness in mind. I was not expecting the coaches to be that impactful, but they have been absolutely amazing! You really feel like they're there with you. They make you smile and laugh and get you to push harder and give it your all.

I usually don't become a superfan of things (or write reviews often), but I really love Supernatural. It's substantially improved my husband and my lives."
2180,Magentafae,"Jul 26, 2020 at 2:54 AM",5,Supernatural Makes My Life Better,"Okay, so I feel like it's impossible for me to be subjective because I am so deeply affected by this ""game."" I've wanted this kind of VR full body and mind experience but didn't know if it was possible. Beat Saber and BoxVR were by far my favorite experiences up to finding Supernatural and I played those once in a while. BeatSaber was more fun and BoxVR game me some muscle.

Supernatural blew my mind. Full disclosure, after the first free month, I committed to the full year subscription. I don't compare the price to the way other games are. I compare it to physical fitness and mental health expenses. After hiking for five years I spent a lot of money on a backpack upgrade that improved my regular exercise and health experience. I've spent cumulatively a lot on shoes and fitness clothes. 

The game is amazing. The sets are diverse songs you'd hear on the radio and you're going to have a lot of feelings from them. The coaches... I can't even... they are so personal and genuine and fun. They're not just coaching your bodies. They're right there with you, coaching you. I can't tell you how many times I've had a tough time in regular life and heard one of the coaches giving me a pep talk. And they're part of the online community. 

The online community is so real and positive and is as much a part of Supernatural as the ""game"" dynamics. Oh, and the creators and coaches listen to the community and you get to see real-life updates and suggestions implemented in real-time. I wouldn't believe it if I was reading this review. haha. 

Anyway, I'm just going to say flat out that I was in a pretty dark place, like a lot of people right now. And Supernatural saved my quality of life. I'm stronger physically and mentally. Regular joyful endorphins every single day and part of this community... I'm a happier healthier person who sleeps better and has found hope and health. :)"

I tried Beat Saber, BoxVR (now FitXR) to lose weight and neither could keep me engaged enough to keep coming back. Supernatural’s coaches, routines, and the Facebook group have helped me stay engaged and keep coming back for more. Sometimes multiple times a day. 

Take the 30 day trial. If it’s not for you then move on. But if you give it an honest try, you may find something special."
2182,Holly Orr,"Oct 10, 2020 at 11:51 PM",5,Supernatural Changed my Life!,"I couldn’t wait for this app to be released. I was already doing all the other VR fitness apps, but Supernatural has been a game changer! A lot of people liken it to Beat Saber, but it’s sooo much more...if you do it properly. Unlike Beat Saber, it’s not a game, however very much like Beat Saber...it’s FUN! 

I thought I was pretty fit before starting Supernatural, and yet I was shocked at how much effort it took to get through my first few workouts. Sure, you can stand there and flick your wrists at the targets, or just duck into the triangles. But if you swing at the targets properly, and squat or lunge through the triangles properly, you’ll get an amazing workout! 

But for me, the best thing about Supernatural is how it has reduced my pain, improved my range of motion, and increased my overall health and happiness. I have struggled for years with the effects of arthritis. I was an athlete who was used to “pushing through the pain”. But pushing through the pain of arthritis isn’t the same. Now, Supernatural helps me do it every day in a way that no other activity has. And it’s sustainable! I can do it anytime, anywhere, and to whatever degree I need. 

I recently had bloodwork done before a routine visit with my doctor. My doctor was shocked with the results, and impressed with how I looked and felt. After 5 months of daily Supernatural workouts added to my routine, I’m stronger, have less pain, and my overall health and happiness are the best they’ve been in years!"

What would be nice is some ab workouts and more stretching videos."
2184,David,"Oct 10, 2020 at 2:14 AM",5,"Good workout, polished app, worth the $","I am a big fan of this app. My typical training is either swimming, biking or running. I have done multiple Ironmans, although I'm not currently training for those kinds of distances. 

I live in Arizona, and having a busy schedule and active family life means that some days I don't get out to exercise before it's 105-110*. Supernatural has helped fill that gap. I always know that if I don't make it outside, I'll be able to get in an hour in VR after I put the kids to bed.

It's not necessarily the kind of workout I prefer, but it makes me sweat, gets my heart rate up and generally gives me a good, low-intensity cardio workout.

I love Beat Sabre and other rhythm games (I used to love DDR back in the day), so this lets me workout while also scratching that itch. The song lists are varied, the instructors are great, and the graphics are fantastic. 

I'm paying the full $19/month right now. Maybe I could consider that a bit pricey for the amount I use it (maybe 5-10 times/month), but honestly it doesn't feel like that much. I have paid much more for various training-related activities. Yes, I'm fortunate to make enough money to justify it, but I think that also means that I am their target market. In my younger days I would have gotten a decent pair of shoes and just gone running for free. And I wouldn't have been their target market.

In short, this is a very polished app with frequent updates, a great UI, great song lists, and it gives you a good workout. If the price of the subscription isn't an obstacle, then I strongly recommend it. If the price is an obstacle, then it's still a great app; it just may not be the app for you right now."

Sure, I’m a sensitive guy, but the combination of physical exertion in a beautiful setting, combined with a few of my favorite jams from the 90’s, just elevates me to a place where I can’t help but purge a little.

2188,Brad,"Oct 10, 2020 at 2:12 AM",5,Amazing!! Well worth the money!!!,"When I first saw this I thought what a genius idea even outside a pandemic.  Working out is not something I enjoy nor is the hassle of going to the gym.  Having to pay for a gym membership, get ready to go to the gym, having to wait on gym equipment to be available, etc all deters me from going.  Then here comes an affordable, fun, exciting workout that plays like a game but when your done you are dripping with sweat!

The best workouts are the one you actually do and I've been doing this every day and love it the same now months later.  With one on one coaching, a new workout everyday, different intensity levels as well as many different music genres there is literally something for everyone.

For those of you that heard it's basically like beat saber you either haven't played both or are doing Supernatural incorrectly.  Beat Saber, at the higher levels, is all about as little movement as possible even the training they have you do has levels where you can't move much.  Supernatural is about full motion working the big muscles of the body (shoulders, quads, etc) and encourages you NOT to bend at the wrist and instead use the shoulders and the legs to reinforce movement.

Even if you are hesitate due to the fee it's got a free 30 day trial so you literally have nothing to lose.  Try it out and I guarantee you will be hooked!"

I love the joy Rainier Pollard brings to the workouts, Leanne’s Inspirational nudges, and coach Doc’s zen approach. I look forward to spending time with them every chance I get, and don’t even mind paying the annual fee because I’m so motivated that I’m actually working out 5+ times a week, which is amazing in and of itself.

Supernatural is for people who are looking to push themselves. If you’re not self-motivated, or are looking for a game, Supernatural isn’t for you.

I am 55 years old and in excellent shape.  My first workout was a low impact choice,  what a blast!  I've now been playing almost daily for several months and haven't looked back.  I love the short 7-8 minute workout choices, the high, medium and low options and I love the feedback after each game.  SN gets my heart rate soaring!  My only complaints are that there's not more workouts added each day (understandable) and I can't pair my Fitbit with the workout program so I have a better understanding of my performance.  I'm constantly raving to my adult sons about how much fun this is and what an excellent and unusual workout, they of course roll their eyes at ""old mom"" playing a video game."

This is my first week working out in VR with coaches and I love it. Supernatural will work your body, your mind, your concentration, your rhythm and coordination and help you to push your limits through intense workouts set in  mesmerizing locations . I am not an athlete far from it, but with Supernatural, I am looking forward to my daily sessions with my personal coaches. You don't have to take my words for it try it! It's free for 30 days, you'll see and feel what I mean!"
2205,Brad Reason,"Aug 15, 2020 at 5:45 AM",1,No way for the monthly cost,"The development needs to pay for the music and for the instructors, we get that. However, this app is basically cutting out the lower and middle class.

There is nothing unique here; it’s beat saber with a voiceover.

“It’s comparable to a gym”... no, it’s not. A gym is a brick and mortar location with physical equipment and insurance. Supernatural is digital information delivered to a platform I’ve already purchased.

 There’s not any kind of custom workout or changes to the programming based on your performance. There’s no goals.  More body tracking and unique physical fun was done on Wii Fit over a decade ago.   If Supernatural kept user performance data on a server and routines were changed based on that user, that would be a technology worth paying a monthly access for.  As of now, Supernatural should be have a lower cost model at $30 which comes with a baseline library of old routines.  Then addon $1 for two routines can be purchased.    This model would include everyone that wants to work out with Supernatural.  No reason to just let rich people in who don’t care about wasting money for pop hits to play while they do a more scenic beat saber."
2206,fido,"Aug 15, 2020 at 4:46 AM",5,This app is a game changer!,"This app is awesome! I am a busy professional, husband, father who often struggles to find time to exercise. This app changed all of that. It’s really amazing how you can get a high quality work out in as little as 15 min or less.

The workouts are fun; like playing a game. Before you know it, it’s over. 

This app was really well designed. Everyday new workouts are available.

To those people who are complaining about the monthly subscription fee, stop being cheap. You could easily spend more at Starbucks than you would for the cost to train and make yourself healthy. How do you expect these people to make this amazing content for free?

One suggestion to make it even better: make it so that you could flag a work out as a “favorite” at the end of a work out instead of having to scroll through and having to find it after finishing.

Keep up the good work guys!"

2209,MrFuzzyEh,"Oct 22, 2020 at 1:08 AM",4,I'm back and liking what I see,"Been busy for a few months and now I have time for some quest fun. I'm happy to see some extra account family options and added services. Meditation and stretching was so needed.

 A small request would be to make sure points can be collected for any type of program. If you meditate, why not have a set amount of points for how long and how well you keep relaxed and still. Points in all areas will keep many ""and myself I have to admit"" coming back to all options. Once this is done, you will then have got my 5 stars 👍

Service has been great and quick. I'll be setting up a year subscription later today. 

Good job, looking forward to see where this can go 👌"
2210,Darien,"Oct 26, 2020 at 7:59 AM",4,"Great game & even better workout, but...","I hope the Devs see this, as I only review games I both enjoy and feel like I have something important to share.

So to start with the positives, the game is beautiful, working out in a gorgeous location makes it just that much more fun. It honestly doesn’t feel like work at all because it’s such a blast, essentially a better version of beatsaber that’s tailored to burn calories. 

Now on to what I wanted to say, while I understand the subscription model is both necessary due to the regular content provided, and would be useful if this game is incorporated into your regular daily workout, I feel that there should be other options to play.

The free trial gets you hooked, but for someone like me or my significant other, we aren’t going to use it as a daily work out. More likely just sporadically when we want some additional cardio, but can’t or don’t want to go outside. 

That being said, I am more than happy to pay for it, but just one time due to the likely limited use. I understand you can’t provide daily workouts for a single price, but it would be cool if you could buy packages or subscribe. (Eg. Core package w/ 10 workouts - 9.99, Legs package w/ 10 workouts - 9.99)

I honestly think it would convert more free trial users that are in a similar position as we are. As of now we are just milking the trial till it’s gone because we know we won’t use it daily, we want to pay for your awesome game/service, just don’t want to subscribe.

Best of luck and hope there a single pay option of some sort in the future!"

2214,Rubicon,"Sep 29, 2020 at 7:38 AM",5,Very easy to say ok one more song.,This is a good workout idea app put together. Ive only have been doing M & L workouts because the H ones are just to fast to keep up with right now. And i feel the explanation being is when you want to get your power score up you have to fully extend your arm to hit the balloons at the time your fully extended and when its on H the balloons are coming in so fast that i have to hit them to gain my accuracy score which sacrifices my power score. It would be nice to plug a C-usb storage full of mp3s on the side of the oculus so you can customize a playlists with the supernatural app. -------------------------------------------------------------------------One issue i did have was needing to remove my headset for a couple of minutes but then when i came back to headset i was locked out of my app and was asked to quit because of tracking issues the only thing i can do was power off restart. How this happens i think its because when i took off my headset i placed it down outside of the guardian perimeter so if you just keep your headset inside the guardian safe zone when you take it off you might not have this problem. I haven't checked that scenario out yet however if you do happen to come across the same error message there is a work around that lets you continue your workout so you don't have to force restart your device..Ill just paste it below just in case.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you pause your workout for more than 2min and put the headset down you might see a stuck unresponsive screen that says lost tracking quit app when you get back. To fix this without quiting your workout and losing your progress all you have to do is stand near the end of guardian line and push the power key (goes dark) then push the power key again (you see your guardian perimeter) and now walk out of your Guardian perimeter and look back at it. You should now see a screen asking you to fix your guardian. At this point you can go back into your safe zone and cancel the guardian prompt and continue your supernatural workout exactly where you left off at.
2215,Wellington_virtual,"Oct 22, 2020 at 1:08 AM",3,Almost worth it,"In the beginning I have to say. It was wonderful. The coaches are amazing. But then, you got bored, unless you like depressing song like ""I little help to my friend"" or ""I'm coming out"" repeatedly and I'm saying repeatedly. Most of the the songs are 80's songs it must be free royalties, because it's just what they're playing and once in while some David Guetta, but don't expect anything trending. For $179.00 year I was expecting at least more options or different backgrounds images (you're just gonna see The Great Wall of China, most of the time, must be another another free source). I wished they could just refund me. It's boring play your favorites songs over and over again to try to have some fun. In some point your favorite song it's just a repeated song. Well, of they say they have 60+ background image, I'm sure I'm not seeing it, I used to play everyday and yes, u gonna see the same landscape repeating in a point that u notice it. About wide list of songs, well you should get rid of ""I'm coming out"" cause I'm sick of it. Refund me no one wants it right?!"

My internet is somewhat spotty. I would like the option to have one or two favorite workouts downloaded so if internet cuts out, i can finish a workout. Nothing else i would change"

2218,Luolin,"Sep 27, 2020 at 10:51 PM",5,"It’s Good, IMHO","I like this app. 
I don’t mind the trainers. I think they are doing a service that some of us like. I would like to option out the canned comments. I got music going, trying to cross over to the opposite side opposite cone, don’t need any commentary. I am the person if I get lost while driving, I got to turn down the radio, if you know what I mean. 
I like the music. I am old, so most of this I have never heard of. But I like it. If you would ask me about genres I’m ok with any, but a little Sir Elton John wouldn’t hurt. Only thing that would really irk me is that since this is a really positive app, environments are great, always talking about balance, then don’t add music that has any violence in it. I will quit it in a minute. 
I like that I can see that these workout increase the heart rate and what not. I don’t see this with Beat Saber or Boxing VR. But getting the right playlist for BVR is key to that I think. 
I think other reviewers have said this but it would be nice to be able to have a playlist. 
Saw the “Dynamic” indication on today’s workout. I guess I haven’t noticed this before. Probably need some explanation for that but I can figure out the context here. 
Again, I know why the Devs have said about the costs. Would like to see some effort to bring down the cost. If not, it’s a bit beyond my budget for me. I don’t even spend $19 a month for Quest games. We all have to pay some kind of wifi bill also. So when the devs say they have their costs, we do to. 
If anyone gets down to this point of my review, this would be a five star review if it’s not for the cost. 
I would like everyone to be kind to the trainers. 
I will update closer to the end of my trial period. Let’s at that time see what the devs done.
Additional, one week later...
I like this still. Devs seem to be listening to feedback. Still has some issues between songs and lag time. Yesterday’s workout had some tech issues with no cones, just balls. Today’s workout was a beginner workout and it was almost too slow for me and I didn’t think that was possible. Anyways, I still have almost 3 weeks left and I think that this will be my go to app for exercise. I will be staying with the app for a while. Truthfully, when I go back to work after this pandemic, I will have to see if I can muster the energy up for either a early morning or later in the evening workout. This app takes a lot of energy. All other apps I can do.
Update: I do these workouts everyday. I look forward to my daily swatting and squatting. I especially look forward to Leanne and Raneir as they are great motivators. SN now has a yearly membership that I think is very reasonable. I signed up so I am looking forward to seeing these great places around the globe while doing these workouts. This is what I need."

It has gotten me and my wife up and moving to the point that we're sore and can tell we've had a great workout. However, the software continually freezes between songs when doing a workout, forcing us to quit the game and restart. This can be highly discouraging and makes us hesitate to start a workout knowing that it's unlikely we will be able to finish and that we will lose the scores"

Would love to see a few features added - A family member has knee problems and it would be great to have the option to “turn off” the triangles. 
- We’d also love to see the ability to just choose one song or even skip songs to get to the song you want to play. 
- We would also love to see the stretches include the balls/cones, just slowed down a bit and with more tails to achieve a stretch rather than increase heart rate.

You get to join the “supernatural community “ on Facebook and other social media cites where you are met with an overwhelming amount of support. This is NOT A GAME! This is like joining a gym or fitness group. The app creatures and the coaches read all the posts and respond to your questions and even your random suggestions!!!!!! They actually customs the workouts to what the clients are asking for!! To me that’s worth every penny. What other VR game can claim that?! I can’t stress enough how amazing these people are.

Always new workouts. Nice to be able to choose intensity & length of workout.

- Relaxing beautiful environments
- Great graphics and sound
- Friendly motivating 3d captured coaches
- Good variety of workouts
- Excellent full body cardio
- Monthly fee means new content daily
- Easy difficulty is a great workout and easy to follow

Cons
- Outside app needed for heart-rate-tracking
- Wifi outages force you to restart workout, no offline mode
- No auto-pause when controller battery runs out
- Medium and hard difficulties have hard to follow patterns that don't make a lot of sense, causes flailing
- Ball indicators are not as clear to follow as Beat Saber's

Suggestions
- ""Build your own"" workout with song choices
- Allow repeating a song at the end of the workout
- Focus more on good form and easy to follow patterns  and less on being beat saber with complicated patterns"

Being home more than usual, Supernatural makes me feel like I've been out in nature, laughing with friends, and working up a sweat. Yes, it costs more than most apps, but the coaches, quality of the videos, constant updating, attention to detail/feedback, the built-in community, motivation, the way it makes me want to move and did I say the coaches? - I'm sold! Nothing like it on Oculus. It's an investment in my physical and mental health.

2238,Mike,"Aug 20, 2020 at 6:19 AM",5,Favorite Game! A few suggestions...,"By far my favorite game on the Oculus Quest and is the reason I bought the quest in the first place.  I consistently work out with this game 4 to 5 times a week up from barely being able to finish a set when I first purchased....  A few suggestions to make it, in my opinion, even better.

1. Allow us to mute trainers.  I like to play sets multiple times, especially if I wasn't able to nail it the first time or if the music was particularly motivating.  Would love the ability to mute the coaches, especially on the 2nd or later go around.  Some times a coach is 'too much' for me the first time and I shy away from playing the set again,  I just find the chatter too distracting.  I know some people are really into that, so not suggesting you change the personalities or what they are doing, just allow me to mute them instead of reducing to half volume.

2. Allow us to make our own playlists.  I love that there's a new set that comes out daily, but would love to be able to mix and match my favorite songs from different sets and create my own 'Best of' playlists.  Would also be kind of cool to see the playlists that others come up with.

3. Let us pick level.  Some of the songs are favorites...  but they are at the wrong level for me.  I'm finally comfortable with regularly playing Medium sets, but High sets are beyond me still, by song two, my arms are dead and my head is spinning.  At the same time, the Low level sets are a little to slow right now and I tend away from them unless I need a rest day.  Would be fun if each set came out where we could pick the level L-M-H and still run through the entire set, but at a speed that was appropriate for me.  I'm sure that this is a bunch of work to do, but this is my wish list!

Thanks for all the hard work you continuously put into this, like I said from the outset, definitely my favorite game to play!"

Some people complain about the trainers voice throughout the workout, I personally love it and find it as a motivation. 
Some people also complain about the price, $20/month is totally worth it FOR ME as an investment to getting more fit. Most people spend that a day on fast food. I doubt that anyone who spent $400 on Quest will go bankrupt from $20 a month lol.

There's a new workout posted every day and I still have access to every single workout from their release date. The coaches help motivate you and encourage you to swing powerfully with good form. I love that I had a 30 day free trial to see if it was right for me. It works with a bunch of heart rate monitors so you can tell if you're getting a good workout. That and the sweat dripping down my face are pretty good indicators. Lol. They have different intensity levels so you can choose what's right for you. I'd describe it as Beat Saber in nature and the force at which you hit the targets matters. I love the variety in workouts, music, and trainers. It costs much less than a gym membership and I do Supernatural every single day (way more often than I went to the gym). It has an incredibly supportive online community too. The app and Facebook group are full of people sharing, helping, and supporting one another. I love my Supernatural fit fam!"
2243,Gunner McQuaid,"Sep 9, 2020 at 11:45 PM",2,HIGH monthly fee w/ few updates??,"Just finished my 30day trial of Supernatural. 
Would I continue to use it - YES
Will I - NO

It is worth $20-$30 as a stand alone app that provides updates the way it currently does. However, they are asking 19 dollars per month for VERY few updates with any kind of variety. 
Most of the music is recycled into 'new' routines, the backgrounds are the same and workout patterns are the same. This lack of 'NEW' content for 19 a month doesn't make sense. IF it was like a peloton app with live classes and new routines then YES 19 a month to pay for that content and music licensing would make sense. 
After 30 days of using the app there were very few actual updates. Perhaps this lack of new content is due to the pandemic?- in which case they should not be charging that fee until they can get a large variety of content with new music, routine length, intensity etc... 
Most of the instructors are good - however, it would be great if they cut down on the personal talk or we had an option to turn off their personal banter. The motivation and reminders from them - to keep the spine straight or abs tight etc.. are all GREAT. But when they go into other stories of their lives it becomes very annoying especially since you have to repeat these routines A LOT because of the lack of content. Having to hear their banter that has NOTHING to do with the workout becomes very tedious and distracting when you want to get lost in the music and rhythm of the workout.
Would be great if they allowed the user to build their own playlist and routines. I wanted more High Intensity routines, but there wasn't a lot of variety with music and other options. 
I was assuming that for the high monthly cost there would be a lot of variety and updates. 
If it was a one time fee I'd be all in. Or if they updated with multiple routines daily then I could see 9.99 a month or something. 
ALso- this requires an internet connection. There needs to be a way to download classes so you don't have to be strapped to"

I've subscribed and I think SN is something I'll actually stick with. It's the first at home workout I've ever been excited about. If I get healthy, then the price is worth it to me.

I’m 62 and had shoulder soreness and this workout is rigorous but low force and my shoulder strength and leg strength have improved  steadily, along with my cardio fitness.  The music varies, but I’ve done every workout since April except when I donate blood or have a procedure... I like trying each workout and benefit from each of them.  I can’t recommend this enough.  I canceled my gym membership as this is the most complete and sustainable exercise program I’ve ever done!!!"
2249,Alex,"Jul 26, 2020 at 3:16 PM",5,I've used it every day for monthes,"Supernatural is great. I new VR workout everyday with a good music and a motivating coaches that know when to interject and push you forward almost like they were there. I wasn't in bad shape to start and  each program makes me sweat every single time. I do it pretty much every single day without fail and look forward to it. Some people maybe put off by the price but let me ask you this? If I have something that I enjoy  that makes me sweat, offers new content every single day, and doesn't require me to get up and go to a gym ( least of all during a global pandemic) if you can afford the price of a gym membership this is a great alternative. Plus free 30 days to decide is more than enough. Some people will also say it's too much like a membership based beat saber. I'm not going to deny the physical action is similar but the result is way different with not just dance music and great music offered perfectly craft 3D environments, an overall level of polish that makes you excited to jump in everyday.

I really enjoy supernatural and you might too."
2250,Dave,"Aug 5, 2020 at 7:22 AM",5,VR “P90X”,"I can’t tell you just how sore I was when I first tried it!! I thought it was going to be like beat saber and I was completely wrong!! My shoulders, arms, back, and legs were so sore!! I even cancelled my gym membership. I’ve got all the cardio I need and I have my own muscle building workouts with weights at home. 

Also the music is AWESOME! I love the modern songs and even songs from early 2000, 90’s, 80’s, and more. I’ve had a couple of songs that are my “jams” and have pumped me up whenever I start to get tired. Honestly, I love it best with the Oculus ear phones (great quality but that’s a different story), especially if you’re working out in the early morning or late at night, but having it play normally works just fine. 

The coaches are awesome as well. They give me the right kind of motivation. They’ll notice when I start to veer off course or it’s crazy how many times they tell me to breathe when I indeed forget to breathe.

The environments are breathtaking and immersive.

Lately, they added meditation and wow!!! I LOVE IT!!! Really helps to ease your mind and cool down after an intense workout.

I have lost 10lbs in the last 2-3 months but this has also been paired with strength training. So it’s not just this, but it’s great if you don’t go to the gym, if it’s raining, too hot, too humid, not safe to go outside, etc. You’ll be drenched in sweat. 

Which leaves me to the last thing. GET A VR COVER. One that is meant for sweating. If you use the original material it can be pretty gross knowing it has all the buildup in the world and it takes forever to dry off... nasty. But with a VR cover, you can just wipe the sweat off and you’re good. 

At least try the free trial! You won’t regret it!"

The trainers are engaged and using social media to stay connected to each of us.  I love them for being there and helping us all engage and be better.  Couldn’t recommend it more.  Just do it."
2253,Wendy Wellesley,"Aug 22, 2020 at 6:02 PM",5,Great exercise - one rec,"Can I recommend re-displaying the location of the image at the end of each workout rather than just at the beginning of the workout? If you are focused on starting the workout, you can miss it, and they are such gorgeous places that it's nice to see again where you are!

Ok a couple of other things - still loving it.

1. Amazing music/workout plan for sweat symphony. So much fun to use classical - can I recommend doing some more of these? Perhaps think about Handel or trumpet (brass led really) voluntaries. Wynton Marsalis has fantastic set of trumpet led classical pieces on cd In Gabriels Garden. Also what about in the Hall of the mountain king? Anyways - lovely to have more options.

2. In terms of favorite workouts - can you put a favorite tag on the screen after you end a workout - instead of having to click out to the main screen to favorite a workout, would be nice to have on screen showing your stats immediately post workout. Also - it says rate the workout 1-5. But I don't know which is better 1 or 5? Need to show high/low. 

3. Also can we rate the workout more in depth? Aka rate music vs. workout . 

4. Can you automatically add leaderboard to include the family profiles? Love that we can now share 4 profiles on same device - but realistically until I can convince others to purchase vr, they are only ones using this app. So would be great to have their workouts visible.

5. Also it might be nice to have workouts where you can disable the squats or arms - aka if you want a workout focused on one part because say you've injured your knee...and don't want to slow down the arm motions, but do need to not squat. It would be cool to have those options. 

Anyways - really loving this app it's great for working out. Really fun idea - everyone I've had try it loves it - sadly the cost of VR equipment is prohibitive for many. Thanks for updating this!"
2254,Anon,"May 27, 2020 at 6:04 PM",4,Would gladly buy the app as is for $25.,"First, the app is great. It is cool to be able to have good music you actually know in there. It’s excellent high intensity, low impact cardio workout (lots of upper body movement with lunges). You do have to be super precise with hits sometimes but I kind of like that. It requires a little more of you physically as it is, which is the point of a workout app anyway.

The problem is the price tag. I get that continuing to make content isn’t free, but I’d happily pay $25 for a copy of the app as it stands today with 30 or so workouts, and buy add ons for more workouts later if I decide to. I’d even consider the annual subscription if it was around $50, and only included a couple new workouts weekly.

But maybe the economics of music licensing don’t work out that way...? 

If it provided a more complete workout, incorporating weightlifting, body weight resistance, plyometric activity and more stretching or yoga, then the corporate gym membership price would seem more reasonable.

If you just need to start an exercise habit, the most effective program is the one you stick with. And yeah, if I was using the app every day, I would value it more. But it’s a once or twice a week kind of activity for me. 

Wish there was a purchase option for those of us who don’t need infinite new content."
2255,Craiggers,"Jul 25, 2020 at 2:27 AM",5,Not a knock off of ANYTHING,"I started SN as a skeptic and wondering how VR can make me healthier. After using it the first time, I could barely use stairs the next day!  The coach guided workouts you get are not only helpful but entertaining as well!  I look forward to my workouts every day now and LOVE the music and routines!  Since one metric is power, you can’t just get away with flicking your wrists to hit targets flying at you and all around nor can you get away with slightly dodging objects. To score high, you have to have proper form, strength and motion. Don’t let others tell you it’s like that game that rhymes with seat baber. It most certainly isn’t. I play both but only Supernatural gets me drenched in sweat and a max heart rate which for me, is normally around 190.  Yes you have a $19 per month subscription but I paid more than that per week on coffee at Barstucks!  Give up the high price of coffee and join the Supernatural community instead!  And by the way, the coaches and members have an awesome community on Facebook too!  They are highly interactive with members and though virtual, you feel like a member in an exclusive gym that meets above the Andes mountains, above an active volcano and even the Galapagos!  Honestly, don’t knock it until you’ve tried it. I couldn’t give a higher recommendation of this app if I wanted to. Seriously, get it now!"
2256,Marshall,"Aug 5, 2020 at 9:33 PM",1,Not worth a subscription service.,"If this was a flat rate I would buy it and give it five stars. However, it's simply Beat Saber with different music and scenes. $179- $200 a year is ludicrous. This didn't work with either of my heart rate monitors. You can't choose music. You can't mute a certain very loud and extremely repetitive instructor.  You can only select level intensity of the workout. There is only one kind of workout. It's simply changes intensity with different songs. Low Intensity is not always accurate.  This has been very disappointing. You're not compatible with ""most"" will known heart rate tracking devices."

2260,FriesSupersize,"Aug 4, 2020 at 5:59 AM",5,Worth every penny... a true workout,"This is the best VR workout experience, bar none. 

I purchased the monthly subscription of Supernatural and cancelled my gym membership because of COVID. I’ve tried getting VR exercise with other apps and games in the past, and while they can get your heart rate up, they are all lacking as a real workout regime. 

Supernatural is extremely polished and full featured. Some of the things that sets it apart: 
1) The locations are beautiful... stunning. You’re working out perched above an impressive selection of photorealistic high resolution, 360 degree 3D vistas from around the globe. You don’t feel cramped inside a tiny room, but instead feel like your outdoors in the open and free
2) Huge selection of workouts, at different intensities, depending on your skill level
3) Personal trainers: Like the locations, the trainers appear at the start and end of your workout as a high res 3D hologram of sorts and give you tips and warmups— it feels like you’re there with a real person. They also talk to you throughout the workout and it really helps motivate a LOT. 
4) Music: The music is a HUGE selling point on this app. Everything else on the Oculus store uses b-rate electronic or dub step that’s cheap for the developers to license. Supernatural has big-name hit music from a ton of different genres. Today I was working out to Queen. And each workout has a different musical theme or selection. 
5) Smart watch integration: This one is really important to me. You can link the app up to your Apple Watch or other smart device to track your heart rate. In between each song, you get a scoreboard that shows you how you’re tracking in each “zone” as your workout progresses. 

The “gameplay” is simple. You are given two bats, like baseball bats, one for each hand. Two different colored pods pass by, and you need to smash the white pods with one bat and the black pods with the other. It’s kind of like Beat Saber, but much more refined. Sparkling paths sometimes appear behind the pods that you have to follow with your hand, and triangular gates appear that require a squat or lunge to get through. Sometimes you have to turn 180 degrees as you follow the paths. It’s a flowy, truly supernatural kind of experience.

Now... the subscription model. It’s always easy to balk at any kind of app that’s priced as a service and not as a 1-time purchase. I can be apprehensive about that as well. However, in this case, it appears to be justified. This is like paying for your Apple Music or Spotify membership, except you’re getting way more than simple access to music tracks. You’re getting a fully developed, incredibly polished, full featured experience. I am going to continue to use this app, and probably won’t be renewing my gym membership once the pandemic is over."
2261,KALove,"Jul 26, 2020 at 1:42 AM",5,Entirely too fast,"Update: I have changed my rating to an enthusiastic five stars! Thankfully the developers have changed the difficulty ratings to set low, medium, and high intensity workouts. I use this app nearly everyday. It has become my primary cardio workout especially during this time of reduced access to my local gym. Some folks may balk at the monthly subscription fee, but I feel it is definitely worth it. No other VR app that I've seen adds new content on a daily basis! The workouts are both fun and intense! An added benefit is the Facebook group where other users and the trainers interact and encourage each other on a daily basis. I'm so happy I tried this app when it first came out and I will definitely continue using it long into the future. 

I just want to know if these workouts have been tested on real humans. I'm fit. I have good reflexes and I routinely stay in the 90% range on all my workouts in this app. But do they have to be so frustratingly fast? It's human nature to try to hit everything coming at you but it gets to where balls are coming so fast and frequent that the bats can't even register a hit and go right through the balls. I end up flailing around and all attention to good form goes right out the window and I notice my knees start hurting. It's more than possible to get an excellent workout without feeling so completely discouraged in the middle of the game. Please rethink how many balls get thrown at people. I want to continue with this app but if it's going to stay at this pace I'm not so sure I will."
2262,Telly80,"Jul 26, 2020 at 12:31 AM",5,They listen to their users!,"Update- supernatural listened to complaints and changed the format to make it easier to see difficulties, and added more beginner levels. It’s awesome when a company actually listens to its users!

I really want to like this!  The premise is awesome. It’s a great workout. The scenery is amazing. I like the trainers . . But I can’t figure out which class is beginner, except the one that says beginner only. It’s really frustrating when I’m flailing around trying to hit targets that are moving too fast for me. 
It seems like the menu filter is there but it doesn’t work. Maybe that’s something that will come later?"
2263,Thorvindr,"Sep 28, 2020 at 7:54 PM",4,Pricey,"Absolutely love the app. Everything about it. Well... Almost.

The physical aspects of this experience are amazing. The ""game"" elements are perfect, and the scenery is okay (if repetitive). But not everybody likes beaches and green hills. I'd personally love a barren desert added into the mix. But if I'm being honest, being that the scenery is just still photography, I'd rather have an artificial, animated backdrop like BeatSaber or Audica. But that's a small gripe. The backgrounds are effective, as they're utterly lacking in distraction.

However: I find the coaches extremely annoying. I may be in the minority but perhaps a future update could include an optional, less-enthusiastic coach for people who avoid going to the gym specifically to avoid this kind of person.

Frankly, I'd rather have a monotonous computer succinctly explaining how to do things with a simple animatic than a peppy, energetic fitness trainer. Some people don't need the constant reminder to breathe, and would rather a simple ""swing harder"" than an unnecessarily-encouraging ""try to hit those targets with everything you've got!"" I don't enter VR for realistic human interaction. When I want that, I'll go find some real humans to interact with.

Isn't personalization one of this app's selling points? How about being able to deactivate the coaches? The constant reminders to ""open up your chest"" (whatever that means) and breathe are just annoying and distracting.

Not faulting the coaches; they know their business. I'd just prefer something significantly less in-my-face and verbose.

Yes, I understand that this is cheaper than a gym membership. It's still essentially a video game subscription, and I'm not used to paying $20/month for that. But we'll see how I feel after the free trial period. I suspect I'll change my tune.

Update: Welcoming, same-day response to app store review earns much goodwill."

I also love the meditations. For anyone who says this is like beat saber- I would love to see them try a SN high intensity workout!!
2265,John,"Sep 26, 2020 at 4:36 AM",1,Why is this game on the Australian store,"This game does not work in Australia, so why can we download it!!!!

I was following this game since it launched and was dubious about the high monthly fees. After playing the tutorial, I would gladly pay for this kind of quality. 

The scenes are stunning, even on oculus 1 and the coaches are really natural with actual useful pointers. I thought it was a beat saber knock off, but it’s far from it. Focusing on form and full range of motions. 

Make the subscription available in Australia and it will be 5 stars from me. Your missing out on a massive market!

There’s a bit of a learning curve at the beginning so I definitely recommend sticking with it for at least a week.

I know others are comparing it to Beat Saber, but for me there's no comparison. In Supernatural the emphasis is on power, and moving  through the full range of motion, not flicking your wrist as fast as you can. Also, the trainers are fantastic. It really does make a difference hearing their encouragement throughout the workout. And I love that even though I am standing in my living room, I can virtually work out in Machu Picchu or in front of an iceberg in Greenland :)"

I needed something to replace my running without having to buy a treadmill. Just no room for it. I do have a clear area for my Oculus Quest games soooo...along comes Supernatural!
This ""game"" may not be for everyone. If so, don't give it a poor rating, just move on. If it is for you then leave the rating you feel is appropriate and comment away!
I like this workout. I turn on a fan pointed at me an jump in. I like to do a couple of workouts at the medium or high level and then end with a low key workout. You can choose your intensity, your favorite coach, each work out is shown with the songs so you know what you're getting. You can pay monthly at equal to $1 (US) a day if you do 5 workouts a week. You can pay around 60 cents (US) for the annual subscription for the same workout  schedule (5 a week). Workout 7 days a week and you average per workout is less. Try doing that at a gym, if one is open. Walk into a gym and hand them a dollar and walk into an aerobics class and see how they react.
It seems that a lot of the suggestions are being incorporated into the game. Yesterday I noticed that the feedback when I hit a target was more pronounced.
Now, the only thing negative I have to say is that there are too many name brand, been around a long time, heart rate trackers out there that are not supported. I have always owned Fitbit products and Samsung (Android OS) phones. I do not want to buy another product to track my heartrate just for this game. Please, please, please make this a priority to get the main tracking device brands comparable with your app."

Awesome locations, great music and the Supernatural community is great.  I am enjoying it very much, highly recommended!"
2286,JKizzie,"Aug 24, 2020 at 6:17 PM",5,YAAAS!,"This app is my favorite thing on the quest.  To be fair, I'm not a traditional gamer, the adrenaline pumping games have always stressed me out, but this is the perfect mashup of workout and game for me.  I struggled with listing cons bc i realized all but a couple of my ""cons"" are just features I'd love to see in future updates so beneath cons you'll find those suggestions in ""areas of improvement.""

Pros:

1.  The people who designed this game clearly learned to clap on the 2 and 4.  The timing of the hits from the beat mapping is AbsoLUTELY 2nd to none.  I tried Beat Saber and the other 2 fames others have gone on about, and I KNOW they are geared toward people who clap on 1 and 3 bc there is no beat to be found in them.  This issue alone makes this the only real rhythm based game to play.

2.  The scenery helps put you into a great mood while you're working out.  It's beautiful, a d they do a great job of matching locations with songs and vibes.

3.  The coaches are great.  They guide you through each workout and keep you motivated.

4. The music is AMAZING.  It was skewing to oldies more at first, but there's a decent mix now.  I love that it's quality music while also being stuff we're more likely to recognize and pick up the patterns on quickly.

5.  It. Is. A. WORKOUT.  I have used this app everyday since I got it, and it leaves me dripping with sweat in less than 30 minutes a day. I've worked my way up to medium intensity workouts now, and I alternate between legs arms and core.  It has transformed my body already.

6. The whole design and feel of the app are a part of the draw.  It doesn't feel like I'm dragging myself to work out or even to push through when I'm spent.  It feels like I'm escaping off to a tranquil place and sweating my troubles away.

Cons:

1.  The price.  As much as I love this app, $20/month is a LOT.  Only my Audible subscription costs as much and even they have a less expensive option.  I'm with y'all for as long as I can be, but I don't see me doing $20/month for more than a few months.  There should really be a download and play option anyway for mobility if nothing else.


Areas of Improvement

1. Please add more search categories to the workout menu.  It'd be very useful to know what part of the body each workout will hit.  Also, I'd love to be able to search for workouts with specific songs or artists.

2.  It would be awesome if we could play individual songs as well instead of only full, curated playlists.  This would be esPEcially helpful for trying to learn patterns for the higher intensity workouts.   

3.  Would love it if we could make our own playlists from the available songs.  And honestly, this feature coupled with being able to use our own music would be worth the $20/month.

4.  Stretching.  It would add to the health benefit and safety of this app if I didn't have to look up guided stretches on YouTube before and after using it.  The stretches the coaches sometimes throw in before or after workouts and call warm ups or cool downs are not it.  I'm told the users for the device skew older.  I know I'm over here aching, and I'm in my 30s, so everybody could benefit from some good guided stretches.

5.  Please more scenes!  We keep getting new workouts, please throw some new scenery in there, too!


That's all I can think of for now, but i gave it 5 stars because if this app was $30 or even $50 or $60 as is with no more updates, I'd buy it, love it, and give it 5 stars.  The high subscription fee with no as is option is my only real complaint."
2287,Ashireita,"Sep 15, 2020 at 9:07 AM",3,Lack of support,"I like the programs and I like the music (for the most part) and the addition of intensity raitings made me happy. Now for the bad, I really wanted to add in the heart monitor and so my husband and I looked around for a good one within our budget, it just came in today only to find supernatural does not support galaxy devices. Which I only found out after fighting with the app then had to go digging to find this out. Really unhappy with how hidden this info is, especially with such devices not being cheap. Very disappointed!"
2288,Jocelynba,"Jul 31, 2020 at 9:05 AM",5,Great workout,"Very surprising, it's a great workout. Scenery and instructors are excellent. Customized to ability the app tracks your moves and let's you know if you are doing well or not quite moving correctly. Definitely a workout, loved it. It's worth the money.

 UPDATE: Day 12, 10 workouts low impact and 1 medium impact. I  recommend starting low impact and then moving up. I rotate among the trainers. I'm already addicted to this.  I'm stronger, feel great, got my pre covid squats back -  Thank you Supernatural"
2289,Queeny,"Jul 30, 2020 at 8:24 PM",5,Love isn't a strong enough word,"I more than love Supernatural!!! Even when I'm tired and not up for a workout, I put on the headset to see what the workout of the day has lined up. And just seeing the starting screen gets me amped up for a workout. The variety of songs and intensities is great for everyone to be able to participate. You can calibrate it to fit your fitness level and change it as you improve, or lessen the movement range if you need to take it easy. I love that the developers actually take our feedback and suggestions into consideration. And I can't even say enough about the coaches!!! They are encouraging in game with the pre recordings but their interactions with the Supernatural community on Facebook are what really helps pump me up and encourage me more. This is not just a game or fitness routine. It is a true community for all mixes of people."
2290,Mamãe,"Jul 30, 2020 at 6:57 AM",5,WORTH IT!!,"If you can afford it, it’s the most fun you will have while working out hands down! Here are a few reasons why I absolute love Supernatural.
1- The play list is fun! You can choose the instructor that better fits you music style.
2- Every one can do it, Low, Medium and High intensity makes it doable for all.
3- The targets flows seamlessly, without tricks to make you fail, for exemple when you hit up the next target will most likely be swinging down. So even on the Hight intensity workout it is challenging no doubt about it, it is still an enjoyable challenge, you don’t feel like they are trying hard to make you make a mistake.
4- The hits goes  smooth with the beat! If you can dance or can keep up a beat, there is nothing more infuriating than a song game off the rhythm, no matter what level you are on your he hits will be to the beat.
5- And no this is not beat saber, it has nothing to do with beat saber. 
6- You will workout more than just arms, the squats and lunges will give you a whole body workout.
7- Raneir Pollard (one of the instructors) is amazing! He is good for my soul! I’m always looking forward for my workouts! 
If you are thinking of getting it! Get it! It’s amazing!!!
I have a few suggestions.
1- make it possible so we can practice one song. 
2- there is a big Brazilian crowd here, would be good if you added some songs in Portuguese, there are a few made for the American crowed by Annita the songs are in English and Portuguese.
3- fix the search for instructor tab, I can’t scroll down."

That being said, I cancelled back in April, and they have continued to charge me $19/month since. 

Despite multiple disputes to my credit card company and many emails to Supernatural customer service, who have assured me that it’s cancelled and that I no longer have an account with them. Somehow they continue to charge me each month! 

Buyer beware, your credit card is not safe with them."

2294,WarmIceQueen,"Jul 28, 2020 at 11:03 PM",5,Gets me going,"Tricks my brain that its a game / music / dancing (?) app but by the 2nd song, I’m sweaty and loving it.  At first, I thought the coaches were ehh but their voices guide me through to keep on going and finish the “workouts”.  I highly recommend doing the warmups and strerches - your muscles will thank you for it.

Love the music they chose, balloons are generally corresponds with the beat.  

The only thing I wish would be the feature to build my own workout set with the songs and intensity, rather than just going with presets.  

I dont mind the subscription ($20/mo). Definitely better than a gym membership during these times."

2298,Javester,"Jun 9, 2020 at 5:37 PM",5,Life changing!,"I can’t recommend this “service” highly enough!  And yep, that’s the main thing that finally convinced me to subscribe - it’s not just a “fitness game”, it’s so much more!
Apart from fresh content everyday, it has expert trainers/choreographers, an ever/expanding library of licensed music spanning several genres, deep integration with Apple HealthKit and google health, an awesome community and most importantly, engaged, committed developers that respond and interact with users on a daily basis.
Since I started using it a month and a half ago, I’ve lost 10 lbs , my posture has improved, and I’ve gotten some upper body definition that I’ve been complemented on.  

Further, I’ve closed my rings on a daily basis on my Apple Watch.

Several years ago,  I used to have a gym membership and even hired a personal trainer for a year.  

I can confidently say that Supernatural has been more effective and the ever improving service is a bargain given the results!"
2299,leadgenqueen,"Aug 22, 2020 at 5:53 AM",1,Love it but keeps hanging,"I have been using it fir a few weeks. I would gladly pay the subscription but unfortunately for most workouts it hangs after the 2nd or 3rd song. I have high speed internet and have checked it’ is connected. I don’t experience this with any other game. Aside from this I look forward to the instructors and workout. Just wish it didn’t hang so I could actually finish a workout.

Would also love to choose my environment to work in because I am afraid of heights and have had some panic attacks in some of the environments."
2300,scintillaa,"Jul 4, 2020 at 10:30 PM",1,They need to rethink their strategy.,"I'm going to revise this grade up hopefully,  but I wanted to put it up so I can remember. I'm also hoping they see this honest feedback and adjust.   If this were a one time purchase, I think I'd enjoy it. Somewhat. Kinda. It's a decent enough workout. Too bad, at the moment, there are so many flaws that I can't focus on what I do like. 

Pros
The scenes are pretty 
The workout will get you sweaty. 


Cons
One of the reasons for their model is their licenses with popular songs. Considering that 3 other fitness games on quest so far officially support allowing  you to work out to custom mapped songs (using your own music), this one falls a little flat. 

Also, you can't choose individual songs to play. That sort of shoots the content draw in the foot. 

The other thing they're touting is new workout routines each day. Which is fine...but there is only one each day. So if it has music you don't like or is a longer/shorter duration than you want... you'd end up playing through an older routine....so...I'm honestly not a fan of hip hop and pretty much every workout has had a song I took my headphones out for. I've heard a few people say ""well if you class you can't pick the music,"" I know. That's one of the reasons I don't do classes. 

Then there's the ""trainers"" I'm not sure how I feel about them. It's not like a real trainer. At the begining of each workout you see a recording of them...and they maybe walk you through 30 seconds of stretching. After that, once you're playing the game they just spout generic pre-recorded advice, which you can't turn off. It's distracting it's not like I can focus on what they are  saying and hit the balloons fast enough.  These are recordings. Nothing personal about it. 

You can't reset songs while you're playing. So if you need to re adjust your headset and want to restart just one song, nope. You'd have to do the whole workout again from the main menu. 

If you live in the US, where download speeds are lower, this game takes forever. I think they must have developed this offshore where download speeds are faster. It takes 5 minutes between songs to load. They need to adjust for US  streaming speeds, or let us download the tracks locally.  UPDATE (4/28/2020): the team seems to have caught this issue and lowered the resolution slightly to decrease the necessary download speeds. Loading is now a lot faster, so I added one star. 

As far as game play, personally it's not all that challenging. VR is how I get my workout in and it's so close to beatsaber that I don't really think its adjusted for people who come in and already play at their highest skill level. It does do squats and lunges..but this too is problematic. You can't turn them off. So if you have knee problems or limited mobility ....too bad.  One more thing I don't know how they didn't consider. When you squat, you lean your neck forward naturally. When you're wearing a 5lb headset... Let's just say it isn't pleasant. 

There's no multiplayer or party modes. You can see your friends on a leader board and chat with them.but if you wanted to have like a contest with your spouse...he'd have to have his own account. And pay the full subscription fee. And you'd have to log out of your account and re-sync the headset each time. 

And you can't change the color of anything. Or pick your own scenes. Or make your own playlist.  


Honestly, if I was going to pay anything for this game, I wouldn't want half of what they're offering. I'd want to own the base game , so I could download levels and not have to wait for them to stream, and if it came packaged with a weeks worth of workouts and a handful of songs, that would be enough for me to use it for a few minutes per day , a few days per week. Until I got bored. At which point , I'd be happy to purchase. I don't mind paying for content. I mind overpaying.    Cause VR has so many great options to make fitness fun, the idea of paying monthly fee that's equivalent to a new game or a proper gym membership just doesn't hold up for one game, even if it adds a new list of music each day, it's still the same thing. And there is no way I could rationalize paying for an iffy game ...ten times more expensive than any other game... especially if I don't actually get to keep the game if I stop playing. 

Because they only have the one beatsaber game, it's hard to justify continuing to pay after the trial. If they add more games, maybe. But not just the one. And even then, not at the price they're asking for Audible.com has a premium subscription. You get 24 credits a year. Enough for 2 audiobooks a month. It's maybe a little more expensive than this is.i paid for it for YEARS. Why? Millions of Hours of content. But more importantly, I keep all the books my credits bought, even if I cancel my membership. And I can still access all of them and if I don't use all my credits in a year, they roll over to the next. 

I'm not against subscription models, but know the market you're entering. Gamers don't need VR peloton.  And even if they did, this wouldn't be the app I would design."
2301,Warrender,"Jun 9, 2020 at 8:59 PM",5,,"This is the Quest killer app for those looking to incorporate a fun daily workout into their lives.  Yes, the monthly subscription is too high IMO but you can't argue against the production values or the workout that you get.  So the only question you have to ask yourself is how much is having a healthier body worth to you?"
2302,senseiz,"Aug 21, 2020 at 10:55 AM",3,I wasn't expecting another saber clone,"At the core it's the VR rhythm game you already know and love just with nature setting instead of neon craziness and worse music. Instead of sabers it's baseball bats and instead of blocks it's balloons. 

Granted, they DO give you motivational talk and the overall feel is based around fitness. There are virtual trainers but very shallow past the tutorial. For example  they will say like ""dig deep"" or ""to finish up the song, bash the balloons as hard as you can"" or ""be sure to focus on breathing while keeping form"" in a narrative voice over the generic music. 

Basically, I would not pay for it."

I have been on a VR workout kick for the last 5 months. I workout in VR 30-60 minutes everday. My go to workout was BoxVR and Beat Saber. I thought I was in good shape ;)

Along came Supernatural. It redefines VR fitness. Workouts are as challenging as you want them to be. My first high intensity workout left me breathing heavy and I am hooked. New workout everyday, new music. Daily motivation from the coaches. Yes it’s uses a Subscription model but it is worth it to me. All I can say is commit to the 30 day trial and to your fitness and decide in 30 days. Awesome fitness app."

2308,LIGmd,"Sep 2, 2020 at 3:06 AM",3,Excellent exercise program but buggy.,The program is  great exercise but it often freezes. It frequently stalls when one song is finished and you are waiting for the next song. It is difficult resume. It often requires removing the VR and walking out of the play area then returning. Even this does not work sometimes. This gets very frustrating. I have Oculus Quest. Other programs seem to work well. Anyone else having this problem? Solutions?
2309,Bygrace57,"Apr 23, 2020 at 5:29 PM",5,An A+ VR exercise experience,"Here is a list of pros and cons that I see after playing it a few hours: 

Pros:
+The art style and production value are top notch. The overall presentation is extremely well done.
+The exercise routines are fun and include top hits from well-known artists.
+The tutorial is extremely well done and presents all of the basic workout movements in an easy to understand fashion.
+You can sign up for a free month trial. You can determine if app is right for you within that amount of time. 

Cons:
-$19 is a month is a bit too high for a lot of people. I think if you used it everyday and the variety and workouts is there, then it would be worthwhile.
-As mentioned in the article, you do need a good size play space. The exercises have you swinging in a full 360 degree rotation around the play area. A yoga mat or something that will keep you physically oriented would be a must have for small play spaces. 

Overall:
For now, it is a great mix of a lot of VR exercise type games and experience that I have played over the years. For me, I'm definitely going to give the free trial everything I got. I will assess how if it is worth it for me after the trial ends, but it is looking very positive."

The subscription fee was a turnoff for me initially, but they’re paying for the coaches to give daily lessons along with whatever music license fees they have to cover. It’s not the cheapest subscription, but you get what you pay for! A great community online and an updated daily workout with coaching is well worth it.

My Amazon is cheaper with so many benefits, or Netflix, or freeletics which has amazing workouts, even some gym subscription is cheaper.

2317,Crabbycat,"Jun 9, 2020 at 10:35 PM",5,I DEFINITELY recommend this game!,"It looks like a lot of these reviews are complaining about the price model. I had similar thoughts when I first heard about it, but I'm glad I tried out the trial, and I've decided to stick around and keep paying for it.

And why? Because I'm already seeing RESULTS. I played a ton of BoxVR before trying this game, and Supernatural hits a lot of muscles that BoxVR doesn't. I'm also super, super sweaty after most of SN's workouts, like the one they added this morning. I really love how they add new workouts every day.

They also  have a really great community on Discord. The other players are pretty uplifting and it's really cool seeing the coaches there that you see in the game itself. 

I used to go to a bootcamp gym last year, and that was expensive... so if I'm seeing similar results with this game and am able to workout longer than 45 minutes a day like the bootcamp offered, it's an easy decision for me to continue on with SN instead. I like how I can fit in a quick workout before I have to work each day, or at the end of the day. 

One note though--there is a learning curve because some of the workouts can be really intense. I recommend looking for the workouts labeled as L (low intensity) and avoid the ones labeled H at first. They've been working hard at trying to get more lower intensity workouts after players mentioned they had difficulty keeping up. I thought it was nice how responsive they were, and they allow players to also recommend new songs.  :)"

Well worth the price in my opinion ‘cause there is nothing like it."
2320,WilsonFamilyRocks,"Jul 12, 2020 at 7:38 AM",1,The $$ is crazy high,I loved the demo. But the $$ there is so many games out there you can get fit with the this $$ is a joke.  I would pay $25 for a four or five day work out. But pay monthly you got to be kidding me.  Beat saver has tons of stuff on it for a one time payment. I just hope another dev comes out with something like this for the reg guy. The guy that will play it a few times a week or month. If I wanted to pay that much just go to gym it’s way cheaper then this. I just can’t say it enough if your paying this every month your getting messed over or you got to much money.  Buy beat saver and a boxing game or 10 and save a ton.

The music is absolutely fantastic and the coaches keep you motivated.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a great cardio workout.  I am 100% addicted!!
2323,Laura,"Jun 26, 2020 at 8:43 PM",5,I'm changing my review,"Originally my review was a 3 star review, and said I wished the product was better and that I likely would not continue after my 30 day trial. Well, I’ve completely changed my opinion about this app. My original issues were 1-No time to look at the environments before the workout started (the Supernatural Team added a pause button), and 2-the squats and lunges came too fast and seemed too low, and 3-I’d like to be able to turn off the coach sometimes (esp. for workouts I’ve done before). 

I’ve worked out with Supernatural every single day for the past three weeks and I’m completely addicted. The music is fun, new workouts are added every day, and I’ve gotten much better at the harder more intense workouts that the speed doesn’t feel quite as chaotic as it did to begin with. I love it, and I plan to keep it as part of my fitness routine. 

It might be nice in the app if you could see the playlist for your workouts (along with the other stats), as well as that graph that comes up at the end (in the headset) that shows all songs and the accuracy/power/heart rate for the whole workout, because that’s a cool graph! :) 

Thanks for a great product (and for being so responsive to feedback), and I look forward to further enhancements and many more workouts!"
2324,Darkwacky,"Aug 27, 2020 at 4:15 AM",4,Frustrating to get started -Good support,"First there is no help on the Oculus store or the Supernatural website on how to get started.   I downloaded this launched it and had no menus no test nothing but scenery.  Though research and trial I found out that I had to go to their website and set up an account.   Download the app to my phone.  Have the Oculus app open on my phone while launching their app and then pair the headset.  

At that point I got to go through the tutorial but then there were no workouts.  I couldn't do anything at all.  I closed the app and relaunched and back to the same blank scenery I had in the beginning.   It was a process of closing apps and relaunching before I got anything back.   When I did still no workouts.  

Not worth $20 a month for.  Had potential but the frustration on trying to workout is just not worth it.

UPDATE: The support team is very responsive.   If you get no menu or account info you just have to wait.   After some time up to a couple minutes the account info shows up."
2325,Chloe,"Aug 26, 2020 at 9:26 PM",2,I really tried to like this.,"Being a big fan of Beat Saber and fitness in general, I was kind of excited it get Supernatural. It was a bit of a pain to get it set up since you need to download a companion app which doesn't really offer much that you can't see in game.  I'm glad they offer a free 30 day trial because I quickly found out it is not worth $20 per month. The real world environments are limited and repeat often. Their quality is not so great either making it hard to feel immersed. The trainers are ok but it feels like their timing is off and what they says feels very generic. I don't feel like it's adding much to the game.I also can't get through a whole workout because of loading issues. There doesn't appear to be away to skip around a session either. The whole interface seems like it needs some work. 

There is an option to connect a heart rate tracker but the options are limited. For the price you could get a real gym membership. I'm hoping this is not the future of VR games. I'd rather pay a one time price than a per month fee. 

TLDR: Not worth the money."

And stuff they could do to improve the app maybe more and different work outs and also different songs as well ;)
2329,bradneuberg,"Jun 6, 2020 at 6:06 AM",5,I love this program!,"Supernatural has completely changed how I work out during the shelter in place that is happening where I live due to Coronavirus. I can’t hit the gym since it’s closed. With my quest, I can put on Supernatural and go into my shared backyard or into my garage and get one heck of a workout. I’m always sweating when done and it’s a lot of fun! The $20 a month ensures that there’s constantly new content and new music￼. I’m not new to virtual reality, having owned Oculus head sets since the DK1 days. I’ve always known that the Quests disconnected and portable nature would change fitness, and for me it was only when Supernatural finally came out.￼"
2330,ryansdavis,"Jun 23, 2020 at 1:11 AM",4,Worth it if you put in the time,"Supernatural isn't a casual/party game like Beat Saber that you can play for a minute and share with friends. It's a real workout, that happens to use a central mechanism that, yes, is similar to Beat Saber.
But you get licensed music for songs you know, custom playlists, beautiful environments, professional coaches, and a full body workout that is real exercise. I consider all of these to be an advantage over Beat Saber. 
Your first 30 days are free, and then it's a monthly (or annual) subscription after that. I understand some people don't like the idea of monthly payments for a VR app. But if you compare it to Peloton...people don't seem to object to the idea of a monthly membership for that service. That's really what Supernatural is aiming to be. A service.
The best exercise is the one you stick with. And 2 months later, I'm not tired of Supernatural yet, so it's a good deal as far as I'm concerned."
2331,Cake or Death,"Jun 10, 2020 at 12:54 AM",5,Love it,"I’m obsessed with this app. I struggle with finding workouts that are enjoyable but intense enough (and, with some back problems I deal with, are still forgiving enough that they don’t throw my body into spasms). I’ve been doing this now for two or three times a week and it’s perfect. I find that I feel great after every workout, and my back problems have even improved due to the range of motion that I follow on this game.  Plus, the music selection makes this way more enjoyable than other oculus fitness apps. Will definitely be playing this a lot going forward."

2337,Stephen,"Aug 21, 2020 at 3:29 AM",4,Lowering my BP,So far I'm loving SN. Can only do low intensity; but I've plenty of room to improve. I've found two coaches I stick with depending on my mood.

2338,DFW,"Jun 6, 2020 at 10:02 PM",4,Great start,"I am an older person who always hated to exercise but was then shown Beat Saber by my kids and I have absolutely loved it, and have lost weight and improved my stamina... but as many have said it's hard to get a lower body workout. As a result, I absolutely love the fuller workout of Supernatural and am probably going to sign up for the subscription for at least a while after my trial because I hate going to gyms. I enjoy the features everyone else has described and agree that more immersive backgrounds (including fantasy) would be awesome.. and, I do agree with concerns about the price point.  When I started out, the low intensity workouts were taxing but I've progressed rapidly and am now doing the low intensity workouts 7 days a week plus about 20 minutes normal level Best Saber and it works for an over 60 y o person. A couple of thoughts about additions-- first, I'd like to be able to change the color of the orbs. The white one is sometimes hard to see against a sunshiny sky. Second, don't assume old people/low intensity people don't like hip hop and EDF/trap/dubstep. This was actually a big draw for me to do Beat Saber as the beats are so fun. I'd love to be able to pick my genre as well as my intensity level. I do love all the 80s stuff and retrofit though! I agree with people that the variable intensity is too taxing. Finally, I feel foolish but for the life of me I can't figure out how to exit the app when I'm done with my workout and return to the home screen to do something else. I've tried every button on both controllers and I just get frustrated and turn off the whole thing. Any tips would be appreciated!"
2339,Steve Mueller,"Jun 30, 2020 at 1:06 AM",5,No more gym memberships for me!,"Thank you, Supernatural! Just signed up last week. Was skeptical at first, but I'm now a true believer (so is my wife). Worth every penny. I've sunk so much money into torturous gym memberships that I never used. Never again. You've done the impossible... made exercise fun and actually addictive. Most people can't wait for an exercise class to end. With Supernatural, I just want it to keep going. It's absolutely exhilarating. People just have to try it to understand. Thanks again!

Totally worth the cost if I keep this up, or maybe I can take what I leaerned in supernatural about building heat and raising my heart rate and core strength and all the other fitness instruction it has and apply it to audio trip and beatsaber and just force myself to do lots of squats and lunges while doing it.... but let’s be real, that would require more discipline than I honestly have 😉 plus the huge variety of long sets of great music and incredible natural backgrounds can’t be beat!

2348,Peter Russell,"Aug 18, 2020 at 4:16 AM",3,Updated Review,"The goods:
- Music playlists and routines updated daily
- Large variety of music
- You get what you put into it and can definitely get could fat burn or cardio in. It rewards more effort and form with higher ratings 
- One subscription for household, having up to 4 profiles per subscription. This makes the cost more bearable the more people you have that use it in your household.

The bads (for me):
- (1.5 star valuation) I understand the logic behind the pricepoint when compared to zumba classes or peloton but It would be a lot easier to swallow at a lower point or as one time pack purchases. I only use this about every other day and already have favorites I will go back to so it would be nice to maybe pay for less sessions a month or  maybe a number of tokens a month to redeem at a discount or maybe even only pay for one trainers playlists at about 7 a month.
- (.5 star valuation) we are a fitbit household amd at this time there is no support in game for fitbit"
2349,BlueGene123,"Oct 3, 2020 at 7:44 PM",3,,I don't see anything worth a month fee in this game.  Not even worth 4.99 per month.
2350,kelly,"Jul 17, 2020 at 5:19 AM",4,Great Workout. Worth the Money.,"I was a bit skeptical at first. I read a zillion reviews where users were endlessly complaining about the price tag of this ""Beatsaber-esque"" game. I signed up for the free 30 day trial. They had a promotion that after the 30 days, I would receive a discount if I paid for the year up front = $149 total. That's $12.41 a month for 12 months (not including my free month.)

Here's my take - at first, I thought the workouts were actually a bit too hard. The Target-hit feel wasn't spot on and I kind of got annoyed with the trainers talking over the music. I didn't like that you couldn't enjoy the scenery either. I challenged myself to play this game everyday or every other day in tandem with Beatsaber and BoxVR. After the month was up, I was hooked. I love the variety that Supernatural gives me. A true exercise game geared towards actual fitness. You are required to reach higher, squat faster, and move with a quickness! While BeatSaber and BoxVR became too easy, Supernatural remains a challenge. I still think hitting the targets could have a better tactile feel and the trainers should just shut the hell up every once in a while.  But whatever - I'm in this for the calories burned. And it totally does that. My body is stronger and I feel better. To me, this is completely worth the $12.41 a month. If I use it 3 times a week; that's about $1 per workout. $1 per workout is such chump change and 100% worth it."
2351,Gopherman,"May 9, 2020 at 12:16 PM",3,Started off strong.. Then.. Blah...,"I have been using this app for over a week now on a daily basis and here is my two cents on what possibly could be a great workout VR application. 

Let's be honest here..  There are so many other ""move and slash"" VR games / Applications on the oculus market. This company definitely did not design the format, but they are trying to improve on it. 

I am not a super fit, young guy with the stamina to keep up with most of the songs they lined up. I fit more into the older dad model who is an empty nester and just wants to have a good workout while having fun doing it. 

Here are some things that I feel should be improved:

1 - The controller feedback when you hit a target is weak. Users should be able to control the level of feedback. The audio cues for a hit also fall in line with this and should be louder. I am constantly thinking if I succeeded in hitting a target or not.

2 - The built in Level adjustment while playing takes way too long to kick in and all it does is frustrates you while you continue to swing like a crazy person instantly decreasing your motivation to continue.

3 - There is no way to see how far along you are in your song line up. If you pause, you see what song you are on, but not how many songs you have left or how much time is left to the end of your routine.

4 - The music in the app seems to only focus on the younger generation. Almost all of the songs are made for people 30 and under. I have not heard of most of these songs and getting into a song that you have never heard before and have no ""connection"" with is difficult. They introduced a Retrofit routine a few days ago and it was almost perfect. Definitely what us ""older"" generation needs. There needs to be a much wider range of music available before I can commit to this app.

5 - Targeting is one of my biggest issues with this program. One day I played several of my other move and slash games before I jumped back into Supernatural and I don't care what the company says, there is definitely an issue with the hit-scan. I can play any other game and be on target, but the targeting on this feels lazy and inaccurate at times. This is a real issue and should be addressed.

6 - This is really not an issue, just a side note. I know one of the selling points for this program is the stunning background visuals while playing. This is a great feature, but in some ways just wasted due to the fact that when you are doing your routine you really don't have time to look around and appreciate where you are.

This is my two cents on Supernatural.."
2352,Dana,"Aug 21, 2020 at 8:50 AM",3,No way,First I was so excited about this when I heard about it. Even with its Monthly subscription I was really excited! I tried it just once... no.. get the fit xr with beat Saber instead.. and guess what! You can pay once.
2353,eusoukai,"Aug 15, 2020 at 10:13 AM",3,"Great, but price is too high/gets boring","The concept of this exercise is amazing, but it gets boring after a while and the price is too high. It does turn into just another exercise after playing it for several weeks, which is why I bought the monthly. This price is way too much to pay and I may cancel after I get bored with it once and for all. I understand music rights are expensive, however, I’ve used other dynamic applications and games with music and they have been much cheaper. If the price was lower, this would be 5 stars."

2356,Azazel08,"Jun 3, 2020 at 11:39 AM",5,Very motivating workout that needs more,"This app is far from perfect, but it is a very good way to get a regular workout. The picturesque environments, pro trainers and pre-built workouts are a good way to replace a gym membership. However, I would really like to see some improvements. Namely, allow the user to create some workouts for themselves. I would also like the opportunity to take an existing workout that you have created and add songs to it. The next and more important improvement... please add time at the beginning of new songs before the orbs start coming because the beginning of each song always has the worst tracking. The entire rest of each song tracks me and the controllers perfectly, but the first 5 seconds always goes wacky. Please just don't start the orbs until 8 seconds into each new song and problem solved.

EDIT: If you stay very still the tracking works pretty well even in the beginning, but I would still like to see them start the targets a few seconds later in each song. It would also give the added benefit of giving us time to enjoy the beautiful scenary."
2357,thoalex,"Aug 14, 2020 at 3:19 AM",3,Inconsistent workouts...,"There is one great trainer in the workout.  His workouts are consistent (give me a sec) and has great music.  He tries to keep the workouts fun (they all probably try and maybe this is a personal preference)

However what's not a personal preference is how inconsistent the workouts of the other two trainers.  You'll be working through a Low Intensity workout and then all of a sudden you're in the middle of a Medium Intensity workout.  That demoralizes you and makes you not want to workout any longer.  And... well... that's what I'm doing.  I'll only use this about 1/3 of what I've been using it because I'll only do workouts with the one trainer.

Music has been a beef of mine for a while as well but again this is personal preferances.  I don't like 70's music or 80's glam bands.  Of course, this is probably a licensing issue so I""m not going to harp too much about this but it's definintely been a gripe of mine as well."

2364,JC,"Apr 27, 2020 at 2:36 PM",5,I pay 100/m on a gym. Would I pay 20/m?,"I pay $100/mo on specialty gym so money is not an issue IF value matches it. That said, would I pay $20/mo for this?

First of, it's actually not as bad as others mentioned here. Let go of the Beat Saber mindset and you'll see what it truly is after a couple of sessions. It's not just a rhythm game but a wholistic workout. You can get a good workout equivalent to roughly 1/4 the intensity of a group class in a nice gym. Pro mode will get you that full intensity and more. 

The environments are near equivalent of the realistic environments of VR Fishing, though missing the nice subtleties that make it an awestrucking experience. It is a nice bonus. 

However, the relaxing environments are ruined by the tone of the coaches. I don't know whether this was thoroughly tested because the discrepancy is quite large. I'd like to be able to focus on my workout with great beats on awe inducing environments and a coach that gives me a good time that I'd like to hang out with daily. Ability to vary coach comments frequency would be nice. 

In fact, just turn it off. It's impossible for me to get in a flow state with the coaches tone/voice. 

Additionally, this has crashed a few times and tracking is quite bad. I get S in Beat Saber and near 100% with BoxVR so there's something off here. 

I pay near $100/mo on a specialty gym so I don't mind paying for value. 

This one however, to me would be around $5.99 a month. I don't mind paying 9.99 IF the developers add awe strucking and breath taking experiences like being near a waterfall or on top of a sky scraper or on clouds and add more songs, ability to manually choose as well as more common harder difficulty nearing expert mode or more of beat saber. At $20/mo, its value is not matched. We'll see what happens in 30 days regarding updates, content, pivoting changes, etc. If little to no additions, I'm out since BoxVR provides heck of a lot more value, workouts, songs, fun and intensity. I sweat more, focus more, and get in the zone better, actually reach the flow state with BoxVR and Beat Saber. Not so with this unfortunately. 

I'm concerned that $20/mo is just the starter price. Not even CLOSE worth that. I understand that developers put a lot of work, time, money, etc based on replies but effort does not equal value. Any more than 9.99/mo and this will push many. At this CURRENT state, it's probably between 4.99 to 7.99 tops. More environment, gameplay fixes, feedback on actions, multiplayer, songs and giving me the flow state and powerful feeling I get when playing beat saber, then 9.99 might be worth it. ONLY way I'll pay 20/mo if I can actually talk to real coaches for accountability, tips, motivation, keeping me on track etc."
2365,Julie,"Jun 13, 2020 at 3:05 AM",5,Use it every day,"I have used this program every day since it was released. Literally every day.

This isn’t for everyone, and for those who don’t like the monthly subscription (and admittedly it’s not cheap), I get it. If I were using this as a casual game, I certainly wouldn’t pay a subscription fee to use it. And yet, I wound up buying an annual subscription, and I think it’s money well spent . . . primarily because I’m getting a great workout, and I love the music.

I love playing games, and I play them often, but I use this program as my daily workout routine. Now that they’ve been up and running for a while, there’s a good amount of content with good variety. Best of all, they seem to be pretty responsive to constructive criticism and the program continually improves. 

For example, I *hated* the dynamic intensity feature, where it would get harder or easier based on your performance. More often than not (like almost all the time), I’d wind up flailing around trying to hit projectiles that seemed to come out of nowhere. That’s not much fun. But then new content started arriving, and instead of a bunch of dynamic intensity workouts, I began seeing low-intensity, medium-intensity, and high-intensity workouts. I love being able to switch things up by doing a low-intensity workout, concentrating on my form and the power of my movements, then the next day switch to a medium-intensity workout where I’m more focused on speed of movement.

The music selection is very good, and I love working out to music that I recognize . . . and even some of the music that is new to me sometimes becomes a new favorite. (Developers—some 70s music, please!)

For the person looking for gaming, I’d look elsewhere. The cost of this just isn’t work that, imo. On the other hand, if you’re looking for an engaging and fun workout, you should try it out. I love that they offer a full month free so that you can really experience it.  And with a 30-day free trial, you have nothing to lose."
2366,Scott,"Jun 27, 2020 at 11:48 PM",5,Worth it,"For everyone comparing this to Beat Saber, the mechanics are similar but there’s no comparison. This is not a game, it’s designed to be exercise program. I purchased a membership and have been using it almost everyday. It really got me back into working out now that I’m working from home. It’s even helped me rehab a shoulder injury I got at the actual gym. 

There’s always new content and they use licensed music so I’ve never gotten bored. They also seem to be listening because there keeps on being great updates that make the experience much better. 

I hope they’re able to keep things going and and add more types of exercises and features.  Really feels like the future of at home workouts."

By far the funnest actual non game play workout I’ve had. I’m looking forward to see how things progress. Please submit your game to the VR Health institute for a caloric burn rating. I think it would rank near the top!!"
2371,Pulled pork,"Jun 3, 2020 at 5:29 AM",5,Very much addicted,"Now I'll start by saying that I'm quite fit and relatively young. I've been playing the game for a couple of weeks now and I'm always looking forward to playing some more. My style of music is very much remote from whatever they play in the game so that's not really an issue for me. I do find it easier to hit the targets when you know the song so you can anticipate the rhythm. I like that the sessions are labeled so I know that I should avoid the hard ones for now. I'm pleased with the number of workouts available for now but I could see how someone who's starting to get back into shape would feel like they are replaying the same easy ones over and over again. Perhaps having the same workouts and voices for everyone but each workout can be played at all of the 3 difficulty levels? I like that there's an actual human being during the warm-up and cool down. Wouldn't even notice on a regular day but this crazy pandemic/end of the world kinda makes you crave smiling people. 

I'm keeping the subscription even though I think the price point is much too high. I'm already paying monthly for other fitness apps and eventually I'll have to select the ones I really think are worthwhile. So far this one is on top of my list though so it's not going anywhere anytime soon."
2372,Epsilon_00,"Apr 24, 2020 at 1:10 AM",5,29 yr old 250lb man's review,"Many games on the Quest give a solid workout however, I feel like most of the time it highlights upper body due to the tracking controls. After an half hour of the Supernatural gameplay my entire body was on fire. With squats built in to workouts it was a good burn walking away from the headset. My legs are sore to a degree unmatched by other quest titles like Beat Saber and BoxVR.

I understand 19$ per month may be a steep fee for some but this experience offered more in my opinion than other titles available. 

There are 6 workouts each day that have different intensity levels from beginner to pro with additional ""relaxed"" and ""tough"" options added. Each workout lasts about 20 minutes with little time to rest during. The ""coaches"" talk during the workouts and did hype me up I won't lie.

Songs varied from ones that seemed to be built for this application to popular hits from Jet, Lady Gaga, and One Republic (to list a few examples).

Lastly the scenery is nothing shy of perfection. It definitely made me feel more immersed and was just the icing on the cake."

2377,JimBob,"Jul 1, 2020 at 10:58 PM",5,"Take a little time, and fall in love.","I'm going to start this review by saying Supernatural isn't perfect, but it is an unusual stretch of the VR fitness approach that merits 5 stars. There's a certain polish here that is entirely unique, and makes for a really high end quality immersion in the experience.  I entered into Supernatural with a lot of ambivalence about the monthly subscription.  In fact, maybe it wasn't ambivalence - I couldn't even imagine that I would sign on.  The first work out had me interested in the platform, and made me do enough of a second take that I thought maybe I'd explore with a trial subscription.  But then COVID-19 had my wife and kids at home, and Supernatural actually has a pretty viable approach to lower body activity that is adaptive for whatever level of fitness you're at.  Regardless of what you invest, the approach encourages active lower body participation to a degree that the obstacles in BoxVR and elsewhere do not.  

BoxVR is a good comparison, as that is the other fitness activity among my family.  BoxVR creates an upperbody experience that Supernatural doesn't approach, and consequently that's an area for my feedback.  Some of the upper body activity in Supernatural seems to try too hard.  All of the activity consists of striking black and white spheres in different directions with sweeping movements.  And I think that is one of the biggest limitations, and where I have requests:  
1) There perhaps should be a punch or some other type of movement that creates more rapid aerobic activity than is possible with the swings.  
2) At advanced levels, moves come on too fast without intro. May be instructor coaching area - left hand over shoulder strike after this squat! Option to repeat last track with speed change.
3) The black and white balls are too hard to visually identify over the background (especially depth perception, and especially when closely staggered).  Color scheme please.

Overall, awesome extension to other fitness choices.  Worth the monthly sub."
2378,Foxer,"Jul 4, 2020 at 10:18 AM",2,Missed opportunity,"I was actually going to buy the year subscription UNTIL I did the 30 day trial. After 28 days, I can't see myself continuing. My rating isn't for the app itself which works well, it's for a subscription that adds no added value. My first biggest disappointment is that the app doesn't cater to me or my fitness level. It SHOULD know that I struggle through the basic workouts (squats, amirite?) but instead suggests an extreme one to me next time. It's supposed to be adaptive - I've never once noticed any adaptation to me or my fitness level; I'm standing there, missing every squat because my legs can't do it, but it sends 100 more. The app is nice, but it's a repetitive workout with an easy to ignore trainer voice and music. The music - a cost factor to require a subscription - but it's double my YouTube Music subscription to listen to a handful of songs. I know the trainers need to be paid, but they end up saying the same thing every workout anyway because there is no variation in the workout to give them things to talk about! A computer could randomly string together the phrases for a ""new"" workout. I wanted to support the devs, but the price point doesn't return enough on the investment and I'd feel like a sucker. If I take the $179 and buy other fitness apps, I'd have tons more variety in my workout. Where's a personalized workout plan? Where is there any variety? (I get sick of Beat Saber and stop playing it for months, and that has more variety than this app.) The data given at the end of a workout doesn't mean anything to me - Supernatural should take the info and build something for me instead of giving me a line graph I don't care about. It takes you to beautiful locations that are all repetitive 3D stock photos and never gives you a chance to even look at your surrounding.  I'm ready to come back to this app, but they need to do something for me to pay for ANOTHER subscription (I'm subscription weary)."
2379,Josh,"Apr 24, 2020 at 1:56 AM",5,Great Workout,"I have been looking forward to this for awhile and was very impressed with what I have seen/experienced thus far. I own Beat Saber, ToTF, and Box VR and all are great workouts in their own way. The problem is I get tired of doing the same songs/workouts everyday and there is nothing fresh to keep me coming back - so I don’t. I like the idea behind this of being able to wake up each day to a new workout waiting for me using songs that I recognize vs random techno music or paying for a track pack containing 5 songs that I burn through and grow tired of quickly. 

The workout I did today was great - I love the heart rate zone breakdown as well. My average heart rate during the workout today was in the 150s and I hit a maximum in the 180s! Needless to say I was gassed afterwards. I also found it to be different than beat saber as it was more geared towards fully completing the movements vs hitting the targets  using just your wrists.

I don’t agree with the other reviewers slamming this just because of the price. The review should be off of gameplay since they give you 30 days to try it before you have to pay anything. If you don’t like it after that point - just don’t pay for it and maybe the monthly price will drop in the future. Do I wish the price was cheaper each month? For sure. Will I pay for it due to the high price once my trial is up? Not sure yet as I will see how it goes the next 30 days. However, I understand the need to have a subscription based model for how they are doing this. My wife is an aerobics instructor and it’s the same model they have to use due to the licensing costs of using current music and the ongoing costs of having to come up with new choreography/content each day. 

If you prefer to just buy a game and use it as is for a workout each day, that is great, that works for you and there are many great games like that. However, this is trying to be something different to appeal to those who love VR workouts, but get tired of the repetition - which unfortunately requires ongoing costs. Will it work as currently priced? Not sure, but I do like the idea and think it is a great game/workout to try out for yourself at no cost!"
2380,Annette Sapphire,"Jun 9, 2020 at 5:37 PM",5,Total workout!,I really enjoy this app! I’m a 50+ female and need major cardio for the weight loss. Gyms don’t equate and and price is less than a gym membership. Just paid a lot for the oculus so I wish it was a lower price.
2381,BunandBean,"May 31, 2020 at 1:35 PM",5,Excellent Workout,"I waited until my 30 day trial was up to review this. The reason why I waited 30 days to review is because I tend to lose enthusiasm easily and I have never kept up a constant workout past 30 days which I was able to do with Supernatural. 

I'm one of those people that pays for a gym membership and hire a personal trainer only to lose momentum within a month. In fact, any sort of workout including playing VR games like Beatsaber, BoxVR, etc can't keep my interest for more than a couple weeks. Most of it has to do with the amount of time I have to put in to get a good workout and the other is I hate exercising period (even if I know it's good for me). Like a lot of people $20/month/person subscription sounds ridiculous to me even with the music assets, environment assets, trainers, building/maintaining game,  etc ($149/year offer is still a bit steep but more understandable). Because of price, I almost didn't give this a shot but I did because of this whole pandemic thing and I am glad I did. 

Right off the bat, I noticed that this game could get me to sweat as much as I did when I had a personal trainer but I can also complete a workout within 15-20 min and not ask myself why I'm paying for misery. Most of the time I was so pre-occupied with striking everything with power and accuracy that I didn't really have the time to think about how tired I was feeling or how much I hate exercise. Yes, Beatsaber is a lot like this game but it is also very different from this game. I like having a curated playlist so I know I'm getting a well rounded workout. I also like that they incorporated squats and lunges so I have a lower body workout too. I love the warm-ups and cool down stretches and I even wish the stretches lasted a little longer. I always neglect doing stretches after a workout because I don't know where to start. I also like the auto intensity, it keeps the workout just over what I think my abilities are without making it feel impossible and want to quit (sometimes it does feel impossible but it doesn't happen much). Initially I thought sweating so much from playing this was because I'm so out of shape so I had my husband try this game out too and he was sweating up a storm (even more than me) and he is much more in shape than I am.  Both of us were sore the next day. What I have come to realize after doing this trial is that you get what you put into these workouts. It can be as easy or as difficult as you want them to be which is amazing. 

That said, I would suggest some improvements such as Fitbit integration, family plan, more stretches, more genres of music, fixing some maps (sometimes they don't feel very intuitive and sometimes maps don't match what the trainer is saying), more real world environments (less fantasy environments), custom playlist (maybe select from a list of songs/maps for a certain kind of workout goal to make it still feel curated but custom too).

I can see myself keeping this up so I will definitely be keeping this subscription and looking forward to new features."

But have surprised myself by sticking with it for a month. I've tried many of the active games on Quest, and Supernatural is the most intense: way more intense than beat saber. It's a great deal easier to put on a headset than to work going to a gym into your schedule, even before considering the ongoing pandemic. And with many of us stuck at home the need for staying active is greater than ever.  While Supernatural is quite a privilege, I think for me it will be worth paying $40 for three months of exercise during lockdown. I plan to continue after that."
2386,Goborgh,"Aug 4, 2020 at 2:25 PM",3,I was excited at first then I got bored,"Not sure what it was, perhaps the instructors or even the music was getting repetitive or the whole routine. I’ve been playing it every single day for the last two months and I don’t miss it. Overall I was feeling that by paying $20 a month I was missing out on other apps coming out that I wanted to try. I think it needs more variety. I’m glad I didn’t sign up for the yearly plan. I wish that instead of giving free t-shirts for a nice review they would do something for people affected by unemployment from COVID-19. I emailed them if they plan to offer some discount but I was ignored."

Pricing is way to high for what it is so far. Needs a lot more content (like Raneir Pollard). SUPER fun for someone who is already starting their fitness journey. 

When its good though this game really shines. The coaching helps if your into that. SOME of the music is great (most of it is top 40 which sucks). SOME of the coaches are overbearing. BUT its a great space to get encouraged and feels positive about making an effort and breaking a sweat. 

Definitely worth checking out the free trial. Hope they take this in the right direction :)

2388,M.M.1189,"Jun 29, 2020 at 9:22 PM",2,"Mostly bad, some good.","1) natural locations are beautiful and nice.
2) I don't want to be in beat saber game where they mix up white and  black.  I just want a workout and not play a video game.  Should be an option for black balls stay on left, white balls on right.  Mixing them up throws me off my workout and I get tired of it and quit.  It works for beat saber.
3) The consent loop talking gets annoying.   Support is great, but not as much.
4) 19 dollars not including tax/fees is unacceptable.  I will never pay that price. 10/12 dollars a max and I would get it.
5) Just a work out, not a video game.  No mixing up the balls to strike at.  If I want that I will start beat saber.  Again, just throws me off workout in where I want to meditate and get a little exercise in.
6) Controller feedback is weak."
2389,Destry,"May 26, 2020 at 2:20 AM",5,"A real workout, but might not be for all","tl;dr I love it, but might be too challenging for some folks.

I've 'played' supernatural every day since it was released and it's a solid workout, even on low intensity days, it you swing hard and do the squats and lunges, you'll be sweating hard. I am more fit than when I started playing. That said, I don't know how good it would be if you're not able to do 15-20 of moderate cardio, or have never played a beat saber style game.

I'm giving it a 5 even though there are some shortcomings, but the team has been improving the app, and it's still new, so I think they deserve a little extra credit.

First the good:
The music selection is solid, a wiiiide range from EDM, to Rap, to classic rock, to R&B. Some songs work better than others.
I love that there is a new workout every day. It hasn't felt stale at all. I was skeptical of the subscription pricing, but if they keep putting out a new workout everyday, they can have my money.
The instructors are actually nice to have. I was skeptical about having some overenthusiastic coach shouting in my ear, but the reminders they drop during the songs and the encouragement is actually pretty useful. I definitely catch myself fixing my form after Leanne says to engage that core!
The heart rate monitor integration is fun data.
The social app is also surprisingly ok, I thought that would be nonsense, but it's been fun to note how I did and see how my couple of friends are doing.

Now the bad:
As some reviews have noted, the feedback on the targets is too weak. I've struggled to consistently land 'power' hits though I do usually have 99% accuracy, so that is possible.
I'm also an avid beat saber player, I'm pretty comfortable sight reading hard and most expert songs, so Supernatural's target rhythms aren't challenging (the cardio and the squats are). So if you don't have much experience with a target slashing game, I could see being frustrated. You can't fail a workout, so those targets just keep coming. 
I don't think there is a practice mode, so perfecting a sequence would be tough, but the workout is the point, not the score."
2390,MarcusTheCarcass,"Jul 4, 2020 at 8:48 PM",1,Has potential but...,"First lets be clear, this is not a “Free” game, it requires a $240 a year subscription. At that price, this is a 1 star at app.  Make it a $30 game and it is a 4 or 5 star game.  
In case you don’t want to read my entire rant, here is my summary. I hope everyone try’s this game, and like me, really enjoys it BUT realizes there is no way they would pay $20 a month for what is provided.  (see my reasons below as just a few why it isn’t worth that kind of money).   I then hope you post a review and email support and tell them that it isn’t worth it.  Hopefully the company will catch on, that to make it worth $240 a year they need to listen to customers and make changes. Or they could just offer  the game at a $30 flat fee. I would be happy with that.  I might even be willing to pay for additional content in the future.
I emailed support to ask how they thought this was worth $240 year.  They said it replaces your gym membership with fun, fresh, and  new workouts with great music (which they have t license) and live coaches. 
1. The low intensity workouts are a bit easy for me. Medium are way to hard.  Not the intensity but the complicated strike switches like you would see in other games. Support told me that just keep playing and you will get used to it.  What will happen is you will start to memorize the patterns so you can make the strikes.  Here is my issue, if I am paying for “fresh” and “new” content  I don’t want to play the same levels over and over again so I can memorize the motions. Just make it more intense without crazy strike patterns.  They also said, don’t worry about the score and points.  Ummm, if you didn’t know already that people buy the Oculus for GAMES you are probably in the wrong business.  We want gamification!  
2. Another comment on the complexity. Telling me to just keep going and I will get “used” to it.  If I went to the gym and had a “live” coach and they asked me to do bench presses and said, you can bench the bar or the bar with 3 plat"

2393,Tim Donahey,"Apr 24, 2020 at 5:50 PM",5,Cheaper than Peloton... and better too,"My gym's closed, the weather outside has been rainy, Peloton is a money sink, but along comes Supernatural to supercharge my workouts again. Most VR games that I play for fitness are over upper-body dominant, but Supernatural takes all the shoulder gains I've made playing other games and heaps a heaping serving of legs on top, giving me the best full-body workout I've ever had in VR. What can I say, if they can keep delivering the high-intensity level workouts I've experienced so far, I am all in on this for the long haul."

As an expert+ player in Beat Saber, I have to say Supernatural's song charts are on point.  Very well choreographed and feel great to hit, and the highest difficulties seem to know where that line is between thoughtful motions and just resorting to wrist movements to keep up.


I also adore the changing environments and live coaches - this is better than a gym membership!! (And wow, the music lineup is also very impressive!)"
2395,aakutou,"Jul 11, 2020 at 6:06 PM",5,First 30 days review,"I might update this later after my first 30 days but my first thoughts of the over all idea of this fitness game are positive. I am not going to give the programmers any more flack that everyone else has given on the price. In my opinion, give them some ￼credit for pioneering something new￼ with oculus. Would you rather spend money on a $700 - $3000 Bowflex gym that, let’s be honest, will turn into the worlds more expensive hanger for a lot of us after 6 months or play this game and get some good exercise over the glaciers of Iceland. With that said, I do remain skeptical. I am hoping that the game does expand into a lot more than what we see in the ￼trailers, like yoga, meditation, ￼ 30 minute stretching exercises, etc. I already saw an ad for ￼meditation, so that is promising that they are going to expand. So I am going to try out the 30 day trial and see what I feel/think each week. 
**First Week** 
My first time playing was not a good first impression. The game gives you some ￼good tutorials but then kind of drops you into picking a workout. No real explanation I can remember on the different levels or any recommended workouts for first time players. I mistakenly picked a high end workout and well there is a reason I got this game, I not fit at all. So this first work really kicked my butt and was demotivating. Got me thinking, I am so unfit that I can’t even play this game right. 

So I would recommend putting some recommended workouts for first time players to help ease them on in. Next, the stretching￼ montage they do at the end of each workout should be longer than 30 seconds, we should go through two or three minutes of a cool down stretching. 

However, outside of all of this I stuck to it for the rest of the week, I grew to really like the workouts once I figured out the level of the workout. I thought the coach recordings over the music would get ￼annoying but they don’t, however I think it should be an option to turn that off, not sure everyone wants that. That aside, I love what the coaches say, they really get you motivate. There were some points in the game that I was struggling to keep up and the things the coaches start really pumped me up and pushed me to keep going. 

I love the ￼ scenery that they take you to. The places are gorgeous, it’s not some 360 degree picture, their is depth and you feel like you are there. However, I would like it if they would say the same of the place. I think only a few times they say the name of the place but I would like it said the name every time. Some of these places they take us to, I have better luck at winning the lottery than pronouncing them correctly. The game really gets you to want to get up and go to some of these places. 

Overall, I think I had a great first week. The game did what it was suppose to, gave me a great work out, a great sweat, I didn’t feel judged like I do in the gym and made me realize how stairs are your enemy after a workout... I look forward to the rest of the month."
2396,Raemon777,"Aug 2, 2020 at 4:43 AM",3,Handles spotty internet poorly,"I was all set out to give this five stars, and rave about it to my friends, and declare it the best experience on the Oculus I had had, totally worth $20/month. But... very quickly I ran into a problem where it as soon as my internet gets spotty at all, the game awkwardly pauses, and then to get it running again I have to go to the main menu, turn wifi off and then on again. 

I'm fine requiring an internet connection when the game first launches, and when downloading new content, but it shouldn't be interrupting a workout. This is bad enough to basically be a dealbreaker for the app for me."
2397,Jordi,"Apr 24, 2020 at 7:22 AM",5,Not another music-cutting-blocks game,"Well, I normally read all the reviews before I purchase or install an app. I have to say that what other people find annoying, like the trainers talking all the time, for me, it helps me to get properly immersed into a real workout with a professional in the gym. I do appreciate the motivational words, and it doesn't bother me at all. I didn't expect this app to be just another music-cutting-blocks type of app, and I don't think that it should be compared with those, it's an application to work out and designed for that purpose with the help of professional trainers and I welcome that. The price is a different story, we may agree or disagree with the cost of it but I feel that the execution of the application is great, I personally think it's expensive for the current amount of content, but maybe is ok if the application develops further, I don't know. This is my recommendation to the developer, to really keeping on creating workouts so that differentiate even more from other games out there that are doing great at cutting blocks while listening to music. Good job."

I'm looking forward to experiencing more content with premium music and grow my battling skills.

2399,steveboug,"Apr 25, 2020 at 5:54 AM",5,Best gym alternative!,"Just got this game and tried out a few workouts and it's awesome. The game was fully calibrated to my height, squat height and lunge height, so it's fully customized to me. The workout is composed of a warm up, a few songs so you get a few seconds to recover between each, and ends with a cool down. There is a trainer guiding you the whole time and giving you super useful cues. I've been training for years and this game has still got me sweating hard, lol, so be sure to keep a towel near by! So far, this has been my favorite quarantine alternative to the gym. 

Also, I find it unfair that people have given this game a low rating just because of the fee. Unlike other quest ""workout"" games that have a one time fee, this game has a new workout every day, so I get that you pay a subscription because they keep adding content. Also, the way I see it, I pay 20$ for the month, if I like it and it works for me I keep going and it's worth every penny (much cheaper than a gym membership), if not, I stop, and it just cost me $20... If you think about it, most good quest games cost more than $20 and you never play for more than a week. Give this a try, you won't be disappointed!"
2400,Lynn,"Apr 25, 2020 at 5:19 AM",5,WOW!,"I just adore this game/fitness app!

The natural environments are so beautiful! 
This has proven to be a really challenging workout for me, never sweat so much!  Kinda gross, need a liner for my Quest ASAP!
I thought I could get in shape with Box VR, BS and Pistol Whip but Supernatural kicked my butt!  Gets my heart rate much higher -definitely a full body workout. 
I hesitated at first about the $19 monthly subscription- thought “no way”.  But how much is a personal trainer? About $40-$70 an hour!  I can have personal trainers every day for only $19 a MONTH? Sign me up! 
I’ll fit this into my budget by cancelling a gym membership I never use.
The songs are real and awesome to work out to. 
Oh, and I like the balloon “thunk” sound when you flub a hit, makes me chuckle. 
It’s amazing, so glad I gave it a shot!  See you on the scoreboards!"
2401,LisaLuLu,"Jul 27, 2020 at 7:09 AM",5,Great Workout that's A Lot of Fun!!!,Totally worth the annual fee. And there is a wonderful companion app to connect with other SN users.
2402,Celeste,"Sep 13, 2020 at 4:29 AM",4,Wish there was a student discount,Love the app amd the workouts. But for now it is too much money a month 😔
2403,SnoozeBar,"Jun 28, 2020 at 8:38 PM",5,Amazing!!!,"I have been trying different fitness programs for years and nothing I have experienced compares to this. There is a membership fee but as long as that keeps driving new content and explores different workouts, well worth the price."
2404,Baxter,"Jul 26, 2020 at 12:48 AM",5,Best workout around,You will get an amazing core and a lot of functional body strength as you dance through this app. I pair it with yoga and am in great shape.
2405,Star Lord,"Jul 9, 2020 at 2:51 AM",5,Great workout app!,"Okay, if you see your Quest to any degree as a potential workout or fitness platform, this is the app for you! It's like playing Beat Saber but with a purpose. Basically this is a guided workout plan that had you using virtual bats to strike targets, while you squat or lunge to the left or right. The coaches are really motivating and help to guide you through the different workouts very effectively, and the music is pretty darn good too!

Don't let the fact that it is posted as ""free"" in the Oculus store and then prompts you to subscribe either monthly or annually discourage you. Nothing is truly free. As of now it's $19 monthly or $179 annually, after a 30-day free trial. If your goal is to use this daily as a personal workout program as I intend to I'd say that's pretty reasonable, actually. Anyway you look at it you get a full month to evaluate it and see if the subscription would be worth it so I'd say what do you have to lose (and you can cancel anytime)?"
2406,ASamLoomisGuy,"Apr 24, 2020 at 5:12 AM",5,Worth the Price!,"I gave it a shot and had my first workout. The first thing that will stand out to people is the $20 / month fee. Understand that you are paying for personal training services that implement modern technology. Your first month is free and you can cancel any time. Between the work that goes into providing content and the technical maintenance, the fee is incredibly generous.

That couldn't be said of the workouts sucked. They don't. Unlike Beat Saber the arm movements are designed to keep you moving rather than focusing on your score. If you mess up the round doesn't end. You keep moving. The workout I did was very squat intensive and my heart rate was up the entire time.

I like all of the trainers as well. A lot of personal trainers come across like they're pandering or trying to upsell. It felt like they are just genuinely trying to make you familiar with the app and like they want you to keep moving. 

This is my new favorite app."
2407,Dina,"Jul 30, 2020 at 2:22 PM",4,Please help!,I got the one year membership and was really excited. The concept is awesome and specially the sceneries. But the biggest bummer is the controllers/bats lose control! (They fly in the air)! Half of the exercise I’m not hitting anything! Is this a glitch from the app itself or could it be my VR?! But it is only doing this with supernatural!
2408,Happy Ninja,"Jun 14, 2020 at 8:40 PM",5,I have never enjoyed workouts this much!,"This is not Beat Saber! Beat Saber is a rhythm game that gets you moving, and it can help with fitness. Supernatural was created to provide workouts that are fun, unique and will improve fitness. I am 62 years old and have always embraced fitness. I have owned my own gym, taught Tae Kwon Do, ran marathons, ultra-marathons, and do cross-fit. 
Over the years I have gotten burned out on workouts. Do not get me wrong, I still work out. I force myself to, except when it comes to Supernatural; I love the workouts! I look forward to them and will often do one supernatural workout, take a short break, and do another. 
The workouts use popular music (not just techno), beautiful locations and coaches that are encouraging. My heart rate gets revved up plenty for fitness, while I break a sweat and use a wide range of motion. I have been doing the workouts for over a month now. I bought the membership and since I use it each day, rather than going to a gym, I more than get my money’s worth.  
Supernatural is a great gym alternative and I enjoy the workouts! Give it a try. It gets a solid 5 stars and solid “well done” to the staff that brings these workouts to life!"
2409,Limes,"May 29, 2020 at 6:30 PM",4,Few weeks in and still going strong,"I've hated cardio/HIIT probably my whole life (with the exception to Dance Dance Revolution back in the day). This game has made me enjoy it and I actually break a sweat. I have been losing weight and gaining endurance and it's only been two weeks or so. 

It's by no means easy, I have several injuries that I'm coping with but this helped me get stronger and reduce my chronic pain and my scores have improved each day that I do the workouts.

There are definitely pros and cons to the app so here's how I see it:

Pros:
- Gorgeous backgrounds to exercise in (loving this right now during covid social distancing)
- Variety of lengths for workout with coaches that make it feel more dynamic than Beat Saber
- Moving 360 degrees rather than just targets in front of you. Triangles also introduce proper lunges and squats
- If you actually use the muscles they tell you to use such as your core, following through with your arms etc, it's more than just slashing at targets so it feels like a well rounded workout

Cons
- There is a lot of hip hop and rap and I'm not really a fan, but then it's countered with ALT J, Queen and others so... it's improving I think. 
- Lack of customization leaves something to be desired. This I'm sure will eventually be improved with song selection perhaps?
- Simple trackers like Garmin/Fitbit are not supported unfortunately
- Price is steep when compared to games. I am thinking of it as a workout and considering gym memberships/group training is usually more and impossible right now, I'm okay with it, but can see this as a big barrier to entry for folks."
2410,Nyxino,"May 16, 2020 at 9:40 PM",5,"The price is high, but it's worth it.","This is the game I've been waiting for in VR Fitness. Great music, a total body workout, and new content regularly. Everyone noting the high price is totally right, but for me, it's worth it if they can fix a few things.

The game is still in its first month, and it is doing a good job of rotating in different music styles. If they keep building that diversity, that'll be amazing. I don't see many of the 2000s artists in the mix yet, which is too bad—where are the pop giants of the recent days past like Foo Fighters, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Eminem, Britney Spears, Dr. Dre, etc.? 

The workout is great, better than Beat Saber (though the new-ish Beat Fit map is great). I really appreciate that. I would like to see a bit more variety in moves, though.

The areas that need improvement are just a few. First, the heartrate monitor options seem too limited. Why isn't FitBit charge in the mix? I don't really want to buy a separate monitor. 

Many of the move indicator differences are pretty subtle, too. The difference between a slight lunge and squat is hard to see. There's no clear indicator that you have two different orbs to hit in the row, left and right, instead of a double-hit of both at once. These could be made clearer—the game should be about making the moves, not guessing what move is called for.

Lastly, the price is high. I'll probably buy the annual membership, but I worry many will quit at even that. Music packs are a good way to solve this. And once you have 100 different workouts on there, do you really need a new one daily? 

This is a great game. I love it. During this pandemic where I can't do my normal outdoor and group classes, it is just what I needed. These fixes would make it even better."
2411,Ron,"Jul 7, 2020 at 7:47 PM",5,Value health but don't like people?,"I had mixed feelings when I first tried Supernatural.  One the one hand, it was a little different having the coaches talk while I was exercising (see the title of this review) and it seemed like a really pretty version of Beat Saber.  But 40 minutes later as I was gasping for air in what I thought were the final moments of my life, I realized that it was the best workout I had experienced using the Oculus but with none of the awkward human interaction and locker room smell that comes with an actual gym!  I was hooked.  The more I used it, the more I warmed to the coaches during the workouts.  Why?  Because the feedback actually starts to feel constructive after a while and they aren't actually there to criticize my frequent sobbing. Kudos!

As a side note (though this isn't a knock on Supernatural), my Oculus broke about a month ago and it took a month to get a new one in.  I hadn't really considered that to be a scenario when I signed up for Supernatural but it's basically the equivalent of your car exploding and your gym is 20 miles away.  I tried to replace it by swinging actual baseball bats in my living room.  Mistakes were made. 

Finally, while I really do enjoy the playlists and song selection, it would be nice to have a metal workout thrown in their now and again.  I imagine that the Venn diagram intersection of ""People who use Supernatural"" and ""Metalheads"" is rather small, but a guy can dream.

In conclusion, Supernatural is the best workout  you're going to find on the Oculus, you will be challenged, it smells better than a gym, and don't swing actual baseball bats in your living room or your wife will get mad.  Thank you."
2412,stansey09,"Jun 13, 2020 at 9:08 PM",5,Got me exercising every day.,"I was skeptical about supernatural, because it looks just like beat-saber, which I already had, and could use use to play any song I wanted whenever I wanted, without a subscription fee.

It really isn't beat-saber though, despite the near identical mechanics, the target mapping makes it a far more active experience.

The workouts are typically a short playlist of songs ranging from 15-30 minutes. You move from song to song and location to location while the trainer occasionally spouts words of encouragement or reminders to watch your form and breathing. I thought the trainer's would annoy me, but I have found that I actually do value their occasional canned input.  Each workout (playlist) is hosted by one of the staff trainers.  Each trainer has a different style and different taste in music. I found myself favoring Leanne's workouts because I like the music she selects.

I have been playing a little over a week, after being pretty sedentary during the pandemic. I did two sessions on the first day I had it and was quite sore the next day. I have been doing one or two a day since and am enjoying the feeling of progress as I feel less gassed and less sore afterwards. 

Some gripes
-Not a huge backlog of workouts yet.
-(more on the quest then the game) sweat is an issue, you either soak the quest foam or use a silicone cover which traps the sweat in the headset creating a thick fog that you can't see through
-If you wind up for certain swings (like the rotations) the quest loses tracking for your controllers when you move them to far back or to the side.
-Overall, the intensity of the workout is limited. I am just now getting to the point where I need to do two back to back to feel like I got a good workout. As my fitness level improves this game cannot remain the central pillar of my fitness plan. Maybe I am wrong about this, I would love to see what else they can come up."
2413,sdferqgwerg,"Jun 6, 2020 at 4:34 AM",1,Half baked at price of professional tool,"Half baked at price of professional tool
At $19/month, comparable with Adobe Photoshop, I expect exceptionally good experience from such a basic app.
The problems:

1. Bugged tutorial, during the first test the banner didn't disappear hiding targets and making me confused until I figured out it is a bug.
2. Hit-scan is broken, I can play Beat Saber at Expert with no issue but here somehow I miss many targets (better filtering/approximation algorithms are needed)
3. No indicators like power, overall score, how much time is left, or how many songs are left
4. Pixels in targets are noticeable, Beat Saber somehow achieved much better graphics on the same hardware.
5. Hand tracking sometimes goes bananas (while it is most likely due to Oculus losing tracing, some detection and approximation would be nice)
6. There is no way to disable the trainer standing in front of you, I would rather enjoy the scenery than look at the guy.
7. Lengthy loading time with a boring black screen. Why not show the scenery? Why they don't preload all resources from the Internet during the previous section or even when the headset is in standby.
8. When you hit the target the feedback is very weak.
9. There is no way to skip intro (or I missed it due to lack of indicator). There is a lengthy, boring introduction.
10. I find the trainers often annoying. I would love to have an option to completely disable them.
11. No option to create custom workouts driven by the community.
12. I couldn't find a way to reset song. Had to replace the battery in the controller and had to either continue broken song or start workout from the beginning.
13. Most of the sceneries are static photos that feel like a cheap postcards e.g. volcano without any burning lava background sounds or simulated lava particles/flow makes it boring fast.

With such a subpar experience, it feels like a rip-off for $19/month."
2414,ScottNYCVR,"Apr 23, 2020 at 11:42 PM",5,Excellent Workout,I really liked the 2 workouts I did and the Apple Watch integration in fantastic.  All the previews for this app mentioned the $20 per month charge so I don’t agree with giving it 1 star just for that.  With that said I agree  $20 a month is a bit high ($10 would be more in line) I understand this is going to be a live service and I think it will be great with new content daily.
2415,Adam,"Apr 24, 2020 at 6:21 AM",5,I get it,"I have been anxiously awaiting the release of Supernatural. I used to pay up to a thousand a month for a personal trainer to come to my house in Calgary, not on a volcano or in England. Count me in for the 20 per month! I appreciate what the Supernatural team is putting into this and I get there are bugs in the beginning so I’ll be patient. I’m looking forward to seeing you all in my living room each day. 

Thank you for braving the subscription world and keep up the great work. 

Cheers."
2416,Milton,"Jul 7, 2020 at 6:44 AM",5,Love this App,"First I want to be clear that this rating is for the app alone. I'll talk about the service at the end.

I need to say that I'm not a super fitness junkie, but I've been doing VR exercise quite regularly. I before this I'd typically do Beat Saber and BoxVR. I can honestly say the workouts in this are WAY better than the other 2. While the other's are good, Supernatural has a better combination of arm movements with lunges and squats that really makes it a workout. Always after a session, I can feel it in my arms, legs, chest, shoulders, my whole body.

Then there are the trainers. That is another huge point of differentiation. In the beginning, I wasn't a fan of all of the coaches (Meg was not good), but the ones that are still making workouts today are excellent. My favorites are Leanne and Raneir (Coach Doc is hit or miss). They are engaging and encouraging in their workouts. It really helps move you along and make sure you are doing it correctly.

All in all, I love this app and it is a great part of my exercise routine.

Now on to the service. There's no way around it. It is just pricey. When I can get a gym membership for $10/month ($120/year), $200/year (or $180 on sale) is just too much. I'm lucky because I received the year membership as a gift, but IDK that I can justify my 2nd year when that starts. I think making this comparable to the cost of a gym membership might be more palatable."
2417,Mskaa,"Jul 27, 2020 at 9:07 PM",4,Nice workout but...,"I signed up for the 30 day trial, I probably used it 20 of the days. It's a good workout and the trainers are fun. It syncs with some activity trackers but not fitbit. If you have physical limitations, ie bad knees, you cannot e
Modify the routines to accommodate, the squats or lunges are built in to the routines. The routines will make you sweat, both from the exercise and the  price tag. I don't mind buying apps I will use, but I just can't justify a monthly fee or annual fee when I can workout using my other apps.  4stars due to not syncing with fitbit and inability to modify to accomodate physical differences and abilities."
2418,Jean,"Apr 24, 2020 at 5:10 AM",5,Love it!,"Did my first workout today and I loved it. I’ve been waiting for a good VR workout app and this is exactly what I’d expect from it. Great visuals and songs and I like having a coach there doing warm ups and stretches.

As far as price goes, Equinox charges $200 a month for crammed group sessions you have to book days in advance. If you are looking to do some cardio the $20 are well worth it in my opinion."
2419,Austin,"Apr 24, 2020 at 4:20 PM",5,My body was not ready,"I’ve been using Beat Saber as a workout for almost a year now and even lost 20lbs combined with diet and strength training but now after doing workouts with Supernatural for the past two days I realize I wasn’t pushing myself hard at all. 

Supernatural is a better more complete experience than your average game. It’s more like a tool and with that I see the subscription model as fair. If you’re serious about fitness especially using VR as a motivational tool you owe it to yourself to jump into the 30 day trial. 

The app and heart rate integration is easy and rewarding. The coaches really push me to focus on form and push myself harder. The movement is geared to a full body workout that has me totally sore on my second day after a 20 min workout. Something an hour in Beatsaber never did.

The visuals are beautiful with 3D vistas in some gorgeous real world locations. 

I think this is something VR really needed and in my opinion worth the asking price."
2420,gregostroff,"Apr 25, 2020 at 2:59 AM",5,Super fun and measurable fitness benefit,"Supernatural is one of the few Quest apps I keep returning to again and again.  It's a super fun, quick, high intensity cardio/strength workout that allows me to keep my daily training going no matter where I am or how much or little time I have available. Sometimes it's a top up to my training in between real life sports activities and other times it's the core workout of the day if that's all the time I've got.  When I first started back in the fall I had been sidelined for training and aerobically detrained so I found Supernatural a great way to begin a gentle rehab....but it was hardly a gentle workout.  If you're willing to go hard it will deliver or if you need a rest it will keep you in the game!  Either way, I was back to my aerobic fitness levels in just a few weeks which was as fast or faster than my experiences in real life.  Amazing!  The music’s great and makes it easy to flow along with 360 full body moves, while totally immersed in beautiful locations around the world.  I appreciate the trainers curating the play lists to achieve the desired results and introducing the songs but my preference would be to have them key up the session goals and lead a cool down after but have the option to turn their coaching on/off during actual game play.  Thank you Within for bringing out a VR specific training app with real world benefits!"
2421,Eric,"May 24, 2020 at 7:09 PM",5,The Half Life Alyx of workout apps!,"After experiencing Supernatural, I can’t go back to working out in BoxVR or other apps.  I’ve been working out consistently in VR for about a year and a half now, and until recently it’s always felt like I’ve been cobbling together apps to put together a work out. So and so for legs, so and so for cardio, so and so for core and upper body. Supernatural has found a way to put everything together into one fantastic workout￼.  The trainers may not be live, but it often feels like it.  And they push you.  I’m not sure if it’s an algorithm recognizing that I’ve started to slack, but if I do they’re there pushing me harder.  It’s fantastic!   I’ve also recognized how much value working out to real songs brings.  The subscription was a no brainer for me, especially since my wife has started working out in VR as well.  After a year of trying to show her the merits of it, it was Supernatural that finally convinced her.

In the future I hope to see new and different activities added for a change of pace.  Swinging bats is great and all, but it will be nice to have some variety of movement, and the ability to focus on specific muscle groups.  Maybe something incorporating controllerless hand tracking?  There is a lot of potential there for different workouts I think."
2422,Timdogg,"May 19, 2020 at 8:03 AM",5,Excellent VR workout,"I had the same initial reaction as a majority of the folks leaving reviews here. Sticker shock, the price is too high, but I figured I would at least give it a try. After using it for the last two weeks, I had no problem paying for the annual fee, that is how much value I got out of this workout. 

A big part of this is because of the quarantine, I can't go to my gym, but that is only part of it, ultimately I can sneak in a workout that has me sweating with a solid heart rate in 20 minutes... the best part, is that it doesn't feel like a workout while I am doing it, only after when I am sore and honestly a little gross with sweat. One of the founders said something about Surfing and that you don't think of it as a workout when you are a riding a wave, you just feel it later when you realize you held that lunge for a few minutes many times a session. I absolutely see this in Supernatural. I get lost in the gorgeous scenery, the music, and the unrelenting activity that I don't think about the workout. 

I also have to admit that I am a fan of the instructors. I am not the guy that goes to gym classes. I don't do yoga or zumba or whatever group class is in now. Typically it is weights and some cardio, limit talking to anyone, get in, get out. I remember in high school having a strength coach really pump you up before a big lift or a run, the motivation and energy that you get from someone telling you that you got this is more beneficial than I remember and weirdly much easier to take virtually. I do agree with some reviews here that it would be great to see the instructors do some of these exercises, even if it is a mode to teach form since I am never sure I am doing it right. Overall, strongly recommend, enough that this is my first review and I maxed out the box writing it."

2425,Ken,"May 16, 2020 at 6:54 PM",5,Exceptional - So Far Worth Price,"If you value quality (and consistent stream of new content) this app is easily worth the price, assuming they keep up their current pace.

On release content was a little light but has continued to improve quickly and will only get better with time - definitely enough to pick from right now to not get bored.

Prior to this my VR routine included at least an hour a day of Beat Saber - that has now been completely replaced by Supernatural. Beat Saber devs completely phoned it in and dropped the ball on new content, and Supernatural filled that void perfectly (so far). 

There really is nothing else like it, comparisons to Peleton don't do justice to Supernatural. Peleton is at its core an expensive stationary bike... this is a completely new category of fitness experience. Beat Saber comes close but there just isn't nearly enough to keep up with Beat Saber, and as I was getting into Expert+ it stopped rewarding the kind of full body movement that made it enjoyable to me in the first place. 

Supernatural Devs are doing an excellent job, and recently announced a yearly plan that will take some of the edge off cost. Hoping for a family plan soon as well."
2426,Gadflight,"Apr 25, 2020 at 1:49 AM",3,Maybe someday,"I'll re-review this in a few weeks, after they get settled but for now: their biggest selling point is that they have access to a vast catalog of licensed songs. But all they seem use are hip-hop (or related genres -- I don't follow the subtleties). Out of roughly 15 tracks thus far, I've encountered one that I find enjoyable. In practice, I'm happier with the more ""limited"" tracks on other games. If they can't use that massive library to give us more choices, then I don't see the point. Once you accept the choice of music, the exercise maps are ""okay"" -- but I can get much better on Beat Saber.

Finally, you've got a bunch of beginners coming in, but you don't give those beginners a way to start without killing themselves. If I want to feel crippled on day two, after doing the ""beginners"" workout, there are lots of other ways I can cause myself pain. Please accept that we are not all fitness buffs, and give us some lower impact or even just 5 minute workouts."

Pros:
1. Great visuals, production and absolutely a fun way to workout.
2. Well done tutorial and 30 days to try it out.
3. Amazing option to stay active at home during the quarantine.

2429,Coors,"Jul 3, 2020 at 6:43 PM",5,,"Only had the game for a few days but I really like it already.  I was trying to move more of my workout to VR so have been doing Box VR, Beat Saber and Pistol Whip all games that get my heart rate up.  But honestly I have to say this game gets my heart rate going the most and next to Box VR is probably the best workout with the arm motions and lunges.  I like the music and the scenery and even the trainers.   I know a lot of people are complaining about the price and I totally get that.  But for someone who was used to paying $12-15 a class for yoga $20 a month for unlimited classes really because you can do it whenever you want is a real steal!  If you are a workout person used to paying for aerobics, yoga, or other cardio type classes this is a good deal.  I plan on adding some wrist weights eventually and maybe even a weighted vest to add in some strength training - hey Supernatural maybe that is an idea to come up with some workout accessories if you already haven't.

UPDATE - Just a a few ideas - could you expand the profile part in  the app so people could maybe describe themselves more.  The ability to add pictures to comments and in the profile might be great too as people can post their before and afters.  Also I see people talking about a discord chat but is there a way to add a forum to the app so people can post questions and interact directly there?  A ""Store"" like I said above more merch and accessories.  Saw the add of Meditation this Sunday so excited to check that out - please add more of that ...different time frames and focuses...I think many people like myself will LOVE that option to meditate in beautiful places with ambient sounds...like near an ocean or a waterfall, temple chanting...honestly mental health is so important now it would be a great add and give the app a lot more value if you are looking to build into more of a wellness app."

I bought the oculus quest first and tried beat saber which is OK but it was like being inside of a Video game. Supernatural has the most beautiful settings and personally I love the coaching. I’ve never been a big fan of someone right in my face and this feels comfortable. For anyone looking for an alternative and a way to get off the couch I highly recommend it
2431,xrprof,"Apr 24, 2020 at 5:03 PM",5,HQ fitness solution in post-corona world,"I'll preface my review by mentioning that I've been developing for and using VR for many years now, and I'm a former marathon runner. With that said, I came in hoping for a nice complement to my home workouts during quarantine. This is a fine solution. While I'm a fan of home workouts like ""Insanity"", being home all day makes me want an escape during my exercise. With an inability to run outside as usual, this is a great alternative. The scenes are beautiful, music and trainers are engaging, and a 15 min workout had me feeling good to start my day. I might do a couple throughout the day as a break. Overall, it's a good solution for those of us just getting started on the fitness track, as well as those of us trying to find our normal again in post-coro a times. Just make sure you have a silicone pad for sweat and ample space!

Pros: good music, varied difficulty, fun/engaging trainers, HQ visuals, Heart rate integration, leaderboards

Con: mostly to do with the nature of VR...sweaty headsets (they're giving away silicon liners), hard to keep gripping hand controllees"
2432,Rally Keeper,"May 7, 2020 at 3:52 AM",5,"Literally, my killer app for Quest","I can't speak highly enough about this app.  

If it helps, I'm a mildly fit (well, pre-pandemic I was mildly fit) middle-aged male.  And, while I'd owned a Quest for Xmas (given as a gift), I just wasn't that interested in trying it out.

I've been looking for quality exercise gamefication for a long time and have never found it.   Like a lot of people, I want to exercise more, but can't seem to incentivized enough.   And, I've never particularly liked group classes or bought into the cheesy coaching.  Frankly, I feel embarrassed for myself and embarrassed for the coaches. 

So, back in the day when gyms were open, I'd typically hunker down with a handful of machines and call it a boring day.

Supernatural really does change the game for me.  I'm only a week in, but I'm honestly looking forward to jumping in every day.   This is hard, fun and motivating.  Moreover, I'm blissfully sore and achieving as good a cardio workout as anything else I've ever done. 

I use an Apple Watch for heart rate monitoring and integration there is great too.  It records as a Watch workout (""Fitness Gaming"") and calculated Active Calories.

I have no problem paying $19.99/month.  It's cheaper than the monthly fees at Peloton and really only the cost of a single in person class at a gym.

I do wish they'd offer a family account (my wife is signing up too), but for now they can take both of our subs.      

As to the coaches, yes, they talk a lot.  That's the point!   They are literally telling you how to exercise better and motivating you.  There's a reason in-person classes are so popular.     

As with some other reviewers, I guess I'd like more music choices -- but really that's about it."
2433,Thirstyhooker,"Jul 17, 2020 at 3:00 AM",5,So much fun!,All I’m saying it doesn’t feel like you’re doing a work out but man it is so much fun I love it I love it I love ! It’s like beat saber but with a purpose! Also I’ve been in bata for a month playing it ! Straight fire!
2434,mallorykramer,"Apr 27, 2020 at 12:47 AM",5,GREAT for the demographic it’s targeting,"All of the bad reviews I’ve read are addressing the cost/value, so I’m going to address that. 
 
If you see $240 a year for an *in home personal trainer experience* as expensive, then Supernatural wasn’t geared for you in the first place, much like Peloton wouldn’t be geared toward you if your reaction to it is “why not just get a regular stationery bike or go outside”. 

I understand why many current Oculus users are dumbfounded by the subscription format/cost, because most of the current Oculus user base would be considered “gamers”. They would also scoff at an Equinox membership. That’s fine - this app isn’t for them. 

I’m a 28/f who does not identify as a “gamer”, only got into the Quest because I had to develop some stuff for it for work, and I spent $500+/month on a gym membership and weekly personal trainer before COVID-19. Services like Supernatural, Peloton and Mirror appeal to me because they are *much cheaper* than the alternative, what I would be spending if I chose to exercise at a gym/with a trainer. As long as I am disciplined, I get the same value from that workout for a fraction of the cost. 

I agree that Supernatural feels out of place in the rest of the Oculus store, but feel that it’s because the target demographic simply has not adopted the technology as a whole yet. Supernatural is appealing to a niche demographic, and maybe it’s too niche for it to succeed (I hope not) but after playing the game two days in a row, I feel very strongly that the workout is extremely different than beat saber, boxVR and synth riders, which I also play regularly. 

This app is incredible, beautifully done, and dynamic in its fitness offering. I look forward to continuing my subscription!"
2435,SloppyTuna,"Apr 24, 2020 at 10:34 AM",5,Great workout,This is really what I want! It works great and unlike beat saber the environment are spectacular! I don’t mind the $19 sub if the $$ go to updating the workout with 5 new environments every week. Maybe add some cityscape or underwater with moving fish :) Also it would be great if they added duos where you can see a friends headset and controls next to you working out from their quest!  Maybe add chat with mic support.
2436,digitaleye02,"Apr 24, 2020 at 4:47 PM",5,Great workout!,I usually use BoxVr which is great also but Supernatural really gets you moving and sweating.  Great music to work out to and time just flies by.  I feel like I'm just staring at the clock in Boxvr but these workout sessions are over before you know it.  Supernatural does have a subscription fee but you get 30 days free and can cancel at anytime via the companion app so no harm in giving it a try.  You can sync devices to track your heart rate but sadly not many are supported such as fit bit and my gear watch.  I reached out to support and in less the 12 hours they responded to let me know they are working on adding more supported devices.  Definitely give this a try if you are serious about getting into shape and just cant find the perfect VR fitness for you.  I promise you will love it.
2437,Coop,"Apr 24, 2020 at 5:45 AM",5,Motivating trainers!,"I just finished my first workout. I’m not very limber and the calibration step at the beginning to measure range of motion really helps improve the experience. 

Best of all is the trainer - Lianne. She is very encouraging and I appreciate the encouraging “Yes!” When I hit some of the targets after a streak of missing them. 

Another great feature included here but not other games is the warmup and cool down. Very important when training and I’m glad you included it!

As opposed to other fitness games where you’re competing against the music or the sequence, this game really wants you to succeed. 

Yes, the cost of this subscription is a bit steep, but if it motivates me to keep coming back it will be worth every penny. 

Because of the personalization, the developers should consider a family subscription so that my wife can also use this (not sure she would)

Another feature for the developers to consider: I had the heart rate tracking with my Apple Watch going for the intro, but I fiddled with my phone before doing the beginner workout. It didn’t track my heart rate. Perhaps the game could prompt to start the heart rate tracking if it’s not getting data."
2438,Natalie,"Jul 23, 2020 at 4:08 PM",2,Joints killer,"What no one is writing about - and I found it strange, is the technique. Squats and lunges SHOULD be done with really right technique, otherwise they are killing your joints. But what technique we are talking about if you trying to reach a target on front of you that are changing fast and in the meantime doing multiple of fast squats and lunges and trying to change a direction? I'm not the novice, but just after a few days I feel my knees hurt. 
Another thing is the app underestimate the importance of warm up and cool down. Few stretches are seriously NOT enough before The intense workout.
For I don't know what reason few times I had issues with calibration - suddenly the floor became too high or to low when I pause the workout for example to drink a water, and there is no possible way to change that incide the workout (and honestly, even in the settings it's too long and boring). 
Pros - I am really sweating while doing that, I love the environments and feel that the experience is more calorie-burning then Beat Saber (but more boring).
Honestly, having no gym these days and with all this heat outside I was considering the subscription. But for that price - too much cons."
2439,niiiiick,"Jul 2, 2020 at 10:00 PM",2,$240 a year is absurd,"This is not worth $240 a year. Even if there are different modes and new trainers, that price tag is absurd, and I'm not even giving them the opportunity for a 30 day free trial.

My quest headset crashed after I finished the tutorial but before following any of the next steps. When rebooting my quest, Supernatural wanted me to go through the tutorial again and wouldn't let me skip it until I was actually doing the tutorial again (and doesn't introduce you to the menu buttons). It was annoying. The tutorial workout was fun, there's a lot of exercise in there, the metrics looked cool.

But this is not worth $240 a year. Even if there are different modes and new trainers, that price tag is absurd."

2442,Kore Jade,"Apr 24, 2020 at 11:52 PM",5,Let’s see where it goes,"Kind of hard to judge an app like this on the first day using it. The whole idea is to have something new everyday so it’ll take a while to see if the workouts diversify enough to make it worth the cost. But here are my thoughts for now. 

I like that the app experience actually feels like a workout and not just playing a game that happens to make me sweat. The constant coaching and lack of game dynamics (like showing points as you go) set this apart from something like beat saber. I saw some folks don’t like the coaching, but that’s what makes it feel like being in a fitness class at the gym. 

The settings are really beautiful and I like the fairly minimalist nature of the rest of the graphics. They cycle through a LOT of environments so hopefully they’re building a big library of these, and they won’t all just be repeating after a week or two. 

As for the workouts, I did feel that this was more work that most apps like Beat Saber or Pistol Whip. Mostly because it really engages your legs with as many squats and lunges in one song as you’d do in an hour in one of those other games. 

Like I said though, the real question will be how much they add. I would want to see new styles of working out, new types of movement, and even some that focus more on stretching or breathing (which there is some of at the end). If the only things that changes are the songs and backgrounds, to me it won’t be worth it. But we’ll see. 

Finally, re: bugs, I did have a little freezing. Also, when you click “start workout,” there’s no visual cue (pin wheel, fading, etc) to show it’s working on it. So you kind of just have to have faith and wait. I haven’t been able to pair either my facebook account or Fitbit to the app, but maybe that’ll improve. Pretty much all new apps have some bugs. 

For now, it’s 30 days free while I’m otherwise largely stuck at home. For free, I’ll happily give it five stars and stay optimistic and see what happens. Let’s try some positivity, folks!"

In Beat Saber, which I love, you can disable both of those things. I'd be willing to pay a lot for Supernatural, even on a monthly basis, if only I could disable those two things. I like to play while on my Peloton bike, and there's no way I can do that if I'm expected to squat or turn around. I LOVE playing Beat Saber while on my bike. It's the best workout ever. And Supernatural could beat that one, if only... I'll probably change my rating to 5 stars if only I can get rid of the triangles and the turning. Also, some people have knee pain and can't squat but would still love this game for the upper-body workout and the sheer fun of it."

2449,Jeff,"Apr 24, 2020 at 7:23 PM",5,Best Fitness App on Oculus Quest By FAR!,"I've played Beatsaber, Thrill of the Fight, Box VR, and Oh Shape extensively and I enjoy each of them. This fitness app is now my #1 for actual fitness, followed by Box VR and Thrill of the Fight.

Pros:
-Beautiful 360-degree landscapes are much better than dark computer-generated caves. It was amazing how much more refreshing it was to exercise in that environment.
-Tracking was accurate and precise. In-app graphics are sharp.
-The motion encourages full motion at the shoulder with the tails on the balls that you are hitting, whereas with Beatsaber you can often just get by with a little flick of the wrist and the elbow once you get used to it. This led to a much more robust upper-body workout and my shoulders feel well-worked.
-Coaches are helpful during the workout, e.g. they give you a heads up that some cross-arm movements are coming. I also appreciated their encouragement during the workout, I didn't find it distracting.
-The triangle squat/lunge boxes led me to find myself in a low lunge jumping right to left to the beat of the music in a way no other app has gotten me to do.
-The short warm-up/cool-down are appreciated, they'll decrease my risk of injury.
- 20-30 min duration is perfect 
-Music was catchy and easy to get into the rhythm of during exercise.
-They are sending me a free oculus quest sweat liner as a core member, how cool is that!? This is probably a limited time offer though.

Cons:
-Obviously the subscription cost is too high for most people. I would be highly likely to maintain my subscription for $5/month after paying $30 or so for the app, but $20 is too much. Perhaps the subscription could unlock added features like the daily workouts, more personalized coaching, and customization options, whereas the plain app would come with a core group of workouts only.
-Music and trainers are not kid-friendly with their language. My young son wanted to play, but unless the songs are radio-edits and the trainers avoid cursing I won't be letting him."

2452,Frank,"May 20, 2020 at 8:41 PM",5,"Refreshing, and getting better","My basic take on this started as a ""maybe"" 3, and is now somewhere between 4 and 5. I'm a reasonable Beat Saber player, and am approaching Supernatural for the exercise benefits. I am also over 50 and not in great shape. 

So, you get curated workouts from a too small pool of mostly modern pop / R&B which relied mostly on a feature called ""Dynamic Difficulty"". This...doesn't work. Technically, the difficulty switches patterns fairly frequently based on how you are doing. But as an exercise medium it makes you switch up your timing, tricky to learn the flow of a song and keeps you off balance.

Fix: New workouts seem to have almost completely dropped the dynamic difficulty and specifiy a low, medium, or high intensity fixed workout. These are MUCH betterm and provide a better flow. 

Fix 2: New songs are coming from 60s - 80s, with quite a bit more rock in the mix. I suspect their user base is skewing a bit older. And the all-disco/funk workout is dead perfect for this game. And awesome. 

Good: I am covered in sweat after a low or medium intensity. Their curated workouts have a much better flow than trying to do something in Beat Saber, and the game encourages wider/stronger moves with less rapid repetitive motions. 

Good: The personal trainer in your ear-thing, coaching you as you go through a song. There is constant encouragement to hit harder, move more, and occasionally advise you how to deal with tricky sections. This felt out of place with Dynamic Difficulty, but now the coach is tied to the exact patterns and flow. And it works. When the evil person on my shoulder says ""hit harder"" I do. It sounds hokey, but the encouragement works for me. 

Meh: Price. Daily new workouts with new songs. Now that I'm seeing how the changes are kicking in, I committed to a 1 year sub. It does seem worth it...now. 

Bad: Hit detection. There is still something off with hit detection. I think the targets need to be a bit more forward of your view so the camera sees them."
2453,Sonia,"May 18, 2020 at 12:38 AM",5,Worth it!,"This game is so fun and totally worth your money.  I have been doing the workout of the day for a little while and I am hooked. Be ready to forget you are exercising : it is that much fun. 

I am out of shape and had a baby this year and I can do all workouts.  You can too! 

Don't stress if you miss a balloon you can't die in supernatural, which makes it way more friendly and def a harder workout than Box VR or beatsaber. 

Suggestion: add more beautiful locations."

2456,Mike Bruckner,"May 20, 2020 at 4:54 PM",5,Amazing Experience!,"Supernatural is hands down my absolute favorite game for the Quest, and it is only getting better. While yes, there is a subscription cost associated with the service, I can confidently say that it is worth every penny. It has helped me to be far more active than I have been in a long time, and I find myself thinking about my next workout all day at work!

The workouts are engaging, the visuals are stunning, and the virtual coaches go a long way to making the experience even better. New workouts are released every day with all different genres of music, so you don't have to do the same workout every time (although I definitely have some favorites). The experience has also continued to evolve and improve lately as well. The initial primary set of workouts used a ""dynamic difficulty"" which would ramp the intensity of the workout up or down depending on how accurate you are. Recently though, the team has introduced a new style of workout which allows you to choose a specific intensity, where the only thing that changes during the workout is the speed at which the targets fly at you.

The companion app works flawlessly, connecting both to my Quest and Apple Watch. Between each song, you'll see a quick graph that shows your score, accuracy, and heart rate for that song. When you've finished, you'll see a detailed breakdown of your entire session, which also then syncs to the app.

More than anything, I am impressed by how much the Supernatrual folks are taking feedback to heart. Whether its in introducing the new workout styles, changing up the music and introducing new songs and genres, or addressing bugs and questions, it is clear that they are listening to what the community has to say. 

For anyone who is thinking about signing up, the free trial is a no-brainer. Give it a try and see how well it works for you, with your setup and your workout style. You won't be disappointed!"

I live in Las Vegas and work in a casino. Our unemployment is over 20%. Money is tight. Love the product, don't love the pandemic prices."
2458,Ben,"May 16, 2020 at 5:15 AM",5,Worth it,"I’ve been using Supernatural every day for a month now. $20 a month is a lot for a game, yeah, but I do think this is more than a game. They have a whole team of people making daily workouts. It definitely feels more like peloton where they are actively involved.

The beatsaber - like mapping is amazing, much better than stock beatsaber levels - more up to the standards of beatsaber custom tracks.

I also have yet to get tired of the real world / science fiction locations. These feel open and magical, a much better workout environment than the typical claustrophobic VR neon fest.

You do sweat a LOT so a sweat resistant faceplate is basically required.

If you end up liking it the annual subscription makes this effectively $13 a month. Which is still a lot but I’m definitely sold."
2459,Christopher Dean,"May 15, 2020 at 8:48 PM",5,Workout Motivation Restored,"For the last 8 years my health and fitness have been very important to me. I’ve primarily done most of my training at the gym, adopting both cardio and strength based training. In late March, my local gym closed due to COVID-19. For over a month, I’d lost all motivation for working out.

When Supernatural released in late April, I thought I’d give it a shot... and I’m hooked. While I will still primarily continue strength training with weights, Supernatural has been my go-to workout for cardio based training. 

Why does it work so well? 

MOTIVATION - since I’ve started using the Supernatural VR, I’ve exceeded my 1000 calorie daily move goal (yes, it has full integration with Apple watches, fitbits, etc.) every day for the last two weeks. My daily motivation to jump in to Supernatural is the strongest differentiator compared to other “fitness” apps. Each morning I’m greeted with a NEW workout - with fresh music and narration by a highly driven and charismatic team of trainers. Furthermore, there is a community post board, allowing me to follow and be followed by the rest of the Supernatural community. 

Many feel the subscription cost is too high. I would personally argue that the cost to support new daily content with top-notch production is much lower than I would be paying for a stripped down gym membership (of which I have no access to right now). These are the elements that will continue to motivate me day after day as opposed to the same monotonous content provided in other VR fitness offerings. Good on you, Within, for innovating to make fitness fun and motivational through VR!"
2460,Andrew W,"Apr 26, 2020 at 1:56 AM",5,,"I’m going to just ignore the pricing and have  this review be based solely on the experience. (We all know it’s overpriced, etc... not reiterating what all the other reviews have said)

Design:
That being said, this is such a great start to a really exciting new side of VR. The amount of thought that went into the UI/UX and overall graphics is something I want to applaud them for. Quest titles too often are clunky looking or pixelated or the 3D effects are off. Not so with Supernatural. 

75% of the stages have an amazing depth of field. (Some of you might know what I’m talking about, games like Real VR Fishing where part of the environment is 3D and the background just appears flat/no true depth is achieved and the illusion of immersion is gone)

Supernatural has really done a good job of combatting that by really making these environments realistic and immersive. Not all of the stages “pop” as much as others, but the England, Galapagos, Scotland, and several other stages are really standouts for me and several of the stages feel like you’re lookin off into the distance (not sure how this is achieved, but please keep it up!)

I’m really hoping the developers keep creating stages, because that is easily one of the biggest standouts of this game and it will be important for people who are continuing to pay a monthly subscription. 

Gameplay:

Okay, so, not to be “that guy” but I like to think of myself as somewhat fit/active. Pre-COVID, I was lifting 4-5 times a week at the local Y, squatting several sets of 360+ etc... even during “shelter in place” I’ve tried to stay active and do at home workouts, etc... I like to think I haven’t totally gotten out of shape since quarantine.

So when I downloaded the app on day 1, I came into it with somewhat of a “how hard can this be” attitude. 

Gorl, what an arrogant mistake. My quads, glutes, and inner thighs were KILLING in the best way the next day. This workout had me breathless, sweating so much I had to have a towel in the room, and was such a fun workout/cardio experience that you look forward to it?? (I’m of the opinion that cardio is of Satan, and team lifting all the way, but LAWD if this isn’t fun and super sweaty way to stay fit!)

I haven’t felt this sore since before quarantine and it made me SO happy to find a way to continue my fitness while staying at home, (because doing 200 push-ups or 400 air squats with a weighted backpack with my Luke Skywalker Dagobah lookin a$$ just gets old real fast)


So yes, those are the things that I absolutely love about this app, however, I do think there are room for future updates. Here are a list of things that I think the Supernatural community can really benefit from in future updates:

1.) Orb haptic feedback for trails. When there are orbs with trails that you have to slice and then trace, I wish there was a form of haptic feedback that could let you know how you’re doing, similar to Synth Riders. 

2.) Future stages. I really hope there’s a steady slew of updated new locations with as much attention to the environments as some of the good ones I mentioned above.

3.) More control. I think having options where you can choose stages is a must have. Also being able to pick songs, because some pop songs get real old real fast. 

4.) Meditation/Breathing/non-physical exercise. I fully believe mental health is just as,  if not more important than physical health. One of the biggest reasons I workout is for that mental health boost. I think taking advantage of these awesome environments, and being able to have a warm down mode where you can sit down or just do non-physical breathing/meditation activities could be amazing. (Especially something to take advantage of during this pandemic). I’m already torn by wanting to admire the scenery while working out, so this can provide a way to fully relax and work on your breath and stress. So maybe having a mental health “coach” is something to look into (think Ten Percent Happier)

Anyways I just spent like half my Saturday afternoon writing this novel, so hope some of this is helpful for potential buyers and the developers."

To me, this app isn’t a game. To me it’s an at-home gym with your own trainer. I loved how diverse the movements were to each song and how it made your body feel afterwards. You really feel every muscle in your body working out. If you do cardio before a workout, skip it and use this app! After I did a playlist, I went into my daily exercise with the equipment I have at home and felt AMAZING! If you can’t go to a gym, then paying for this app each month is just as good. 

 I know it is new so it does need some tuning up with  accuracy. Some times I would be hitting the orbs but it wouldn’t count it. That was the only flaw I experienced.  

This app is my all time favorite on my Oculus Quest."

Upgraded environments, upgraded music, new routines, synchronization between the app and a heart rate strap or Apple Watch and a phone. It’s got a lot of extras. It’s clearly very well made, but you’re paying for it to be well made."

I've only been using this for two days but I can hardly walk today.  It's very fun and beautifully designed.  I know it's like other games but I like that it's more focused on movement than just smacking things.  You sort of discover that there is an intentional groove to the movements.  I like that it syncs with my phone and the heart rate monitor on my Apple Watch.  I have the goal of using it everyday for the 30 day trial and will judge it more at that time if I feel the membership fee is worth it.  If I'm still having fun and I'm feeling better and have more energy through the day I'll continue to use it. 
 
One note for the developers:  When I finished my workout today my wife asked if that was it?  She was watching it streamed to my iPad.  She was surprised that the virtual coach didn't go through more of an end of workout cool down exercise of some sort.  To help you ease out of it.  After thinking about it that seems like an important detail that's been missed - especially for people like me that don't typically exercise.  Maybe suggest stretches or breathing exercises to cool down?  In my case my wife is athletic and she walked me through a few good stretches and breathing techniques that I wouldn't have known about otherwise.  Keep up the good work and hopefully it stays pretty diverse."
2465,Donuts,"May 17, 2020 at 11:53 PM",5,"Super fun, good workout","Cheaper than a gym membership and as fun as Beat Saber with a different slant. I have pretty vanilla musical taste (Hip-Hop, Pop, Dance and K-Pop). The song choices are a good mix of the first two. But the body movements are great and motivation comes from the coach, not from obsessing over score, which brings a lot of value over other rhythm games.

The sceneries are also nice but as usual, any sort of VR experience that uses recordings or photos looks a little strange. It’s also kind of a strange choice to do a workout on top of an active volcano. The coaches seem very small, and, while 3D, they look more like holograms than someone in front of you.

But overall, this program deserves every star. I’m excited and happy to be on a fitness journey with Supernatural."
2466,G3Bishop,"Apr 30, 2020 at 4:33 AM",5,From Skeptic to Believer,"Okay, so the biggest complaint everyone is going to have? It costs too much. And yeah, you’d think that..until you actually try it. And by try it, I don’t mean an hour or so...I’m talking about committing to at least a week of training. As a professional fitness instructor, I can say, without a doubt, this program works. 

First of all, the instructors, while on the surface seem a bit gimmicky, actually begin to grow on you. They’re purpose is to motivate and inspire you throughout the course of your training, and for the most part...it works. As you get to know each personality, you begin to look forward to what they’ll present next, which can be quite fun. (also, keep in mind that no two workouts are the same. You get a new workout for each day of the week, which I absolutely love). Secondly, the music...it’s awesome. These aren’t generic tracks, like the ones you hear in most other rhythm games...no, these are the real deal. Lizzo, One Republic, The Weekend...some of the greatest artists and their songs will, not only motivate you to come back for more, but push you through to the end when you feel like you’ve had enough. 

My last training session consisted of two workouts, lasting roughly 33 minutes. During that time, I burned 360 calories, with an average heart rate of 145. I hit max heart-rate (184 BPM) on several occasions and almost gave up as I drew closer to the end of the routine (keep in mind, I wear 1lb gloves and an 8lb weighted vest while training). Two things got me through it...my propensity to always finish what I start...and Lady Gaga! Lol, seriously, if that’s not worth 20 bucks, I don’t know what else is. 

(I charge 50 bucks an hour and would consider it great day to see one of my clients burn 360 calories in a half hour!)

Give it shot. Commit to a solid month of training...as you improve, add some weighted gear. By the end of the month, if you don’t look and feel better than when you started, cancel the free 30 day trial. Beside a sedentary lifestyle and excess body fat...

what do you have to lose?"
2467,evertec,"Apr 27, 2020 at 7:36 PM",5,A New Standard in VR Fitness!,"I’ve been testing the beta version of Supernatural for a little over two weeks now and I’m absolutely hooked! The entire experience is extremely polished and has already shown results. On the surface, this will look similar to other rhythm games out there (I’m a huge Beat Saber player btw) but in actual gameplay, Supernatural is quite different than anything I’ve yet played in how it makes you workout.

The proof of its fitness effectiveness is just trying it for a couple of weeks and feeling the results. I absolutely recommend trying the 30-day free trial. If you’re like me, then you’ll look back on your first two weeks and find that you looked forward to working out more than you ever have before, burned more calories than in any other VR game and - this is an important one - are feeling better than you have in a long time (the movements in the game just feel really good to do).

If you’re expecting this to be a “rhythm game,” it’s not and you will most likely be disappointed (it’s more along the lines of a Peleton fitness program than Beat Saber). For example, you can’t just select a particular song to play, you can play either a brand new daily workout designed for that day or past ones in different categories. Competition is based around pushing you and your friends in workouts rather than getting a “high score based on gameplay mechanics.” For example, scoring is based more on how you worked out to that song (power used to hit notes, squats, etc.), not just on how many notes you hit or the precision of your swing arc, etc..

Is Supernatural for everyone? It depends - it's a fitness program. You have to want to intensely workout and get very sweaty every time you “play.” Secondly, after the free month trial, the $19 a month may be out of some people’s budget. If you’re considering a $2,500 Peleton bike + their $40 a month subscription, then Supernatural will be a steal for what you get. If you... (read full review: https://bit.ly/3cE7Qcr)"

My second review was four.
As you can see this one is five.

In my first review I talked about how the app was awesome, but the price was too high considering the competition.  I asserted that because of apps like Beat Saber, Boxing VR and others, that the price of this was just not competitive.  Though the product itself was awesome.  I also made the assertion that I could get the same workout through Beat Saber.  Which incidentally I can play at the Expert + level.

After using this app for one day, I relented and upped my review to four stars.  Because it was kicking my butt.  In fifteen minutes I get more exercise than I do in an hour of beat saber.  I breath harder, and I sweat a lot more.  I didn't go to five stars because I was still irritated with the price.

Today is the third day.  I have used this app all three days.  I have gotten really good workouts with fitness tracking and detailed stats.  The coaches are fantastic.  The music is great.  And dang, my arms and legs burn so much more than other apps.

At this point I will most likely be continuing my subscription.  

The scenery is awesome, the workouts are great, the coaches are helpful, and the exercise is probably the most effective 20 minutes in VR that I have each day.

I don’t know what all the complaining is about. They give you a free month just to try it out. Personally $20 a month for this is a good deal . But you can pay an annual fee as well .That makes it 12.50 a month.  That is a bomb deal !!!

I’ve used Supernatural for the past 2 weeks and overall, I like it.. a lot! I understand that there are a lot of similar “games” on the App Store but I enjoy the environments and the fitness focus this application takes. 

$20 a month may be a lot for some folks but you are using a virtual reality headset to exercise.. lot of overkill here. 
Technically you can do HIIT with push-ups/pull-up/running which are all free! 

Why choose to pay $20 a month to workout with a headset in a virtual environment?
Motivation.

Most people can buy a few cups of coffee or dinner for $20. The Cost-Benefit Analysis and time-calorie displacement analysis is on point for me. I burn about 750 calories (male 6’ 1” 215 lb) from 3 sessions back-to-back which is usually about an hour with the warm-up and cool downs.. each workout has been performed 4-5 times a week is about 3,750 calories burned in a week or 15,000 calories a month/20 sessions a month.. about 750 calories/dollar! 

I can lose about the same with any other free workout but it seems like work.. some people are okay with the work! Supernatural doesn’t seem like work to me.. My hour workouts seem like 20-30 minutes.. 

I’m only writing this review because I want the developers to know that they have made a change in my life for the better and I want their services to grow and evolve!"

The locations where you workout are meticulously recreated in beautiful 3D and are themselves an inspiration. The exercises are challenging and fun but actually adapt in near real-time to your specific level of effort. I couldn’t keep up at first and the app made it a bit easier WHILE I was doing the exercise. The coaches are what I needed most. It’s such a comfort to have them guide me through each session.

Please keep in mind the intention of this app is for workout purposes, which I feel it does very well. It makes you use your arms, core, legs, shoulders, and gets your heart rate pumping. I’ve done 4 workouts thus far. The coaches keep you motivated, especially since you’re most likely not going to get a perfect score. Again, the intention is to get a great workout, not climb the leaderboards. The music is great for working out. One thing I would like to see is the dynamic difficulty ramp up a bit slower. The game seems to have a lot of confidence in me haha. If you’re looking for an alternative to the gym during the shelter we’re under, or if the gym isn’t for you, I feel this is a great alternative to stay in shape. It is going to be added to my weekly routine. I’ve seen them say the $19.99 a month will also be offered alternatively at a discounted price with a longer commitment, which I think is great. I would like to get an update on that as soon as they have more to share. I also really like the Apple Watch tracking so I can see my bpm and cals burned.

2484,ethayne,"Apr 25, 2020 at 6:52 PM",5,This is NOT a Beat Saber clone,"Yes, I was skeptical of the pricing model too at first, but I’ll get to that in a second...

I’ve been using Beat Saber as my workout for the last couple weeks since the gyms are closed. When they released their FitBeat song, that was when I really got into it. But playing the same song over and over again gets old really fast.

And that’s where Supernatural really shines. You get a brand new workout every day, all intended to get you sweating. Not to mention multiple coaches, top 100 songs, amazing locations, and beautiful app design and functionality. The top notch production value proves there’s a talented team behind this thing.

Yes, the mechanics are similar to Beat Saber or any other rhythm game for that matter. But this is clearly different. It’s not a video game for kids, it’s a gamified workout for people serious about getting fit. 

As for the price, yes $19/mo seems a little steep. It’s high enough that it requires a little bit of commitment. But for the right person, I think it makes sense. As for me, I’m going to give it a full 30 day trial and see how it goes. 

Don’t be fooled by the 1 star reviews from people who haven’t even tried it (it’s only been out for two days as of writing this). This is an A+ experience so far and I’m excited to see it continue to develop."
2485,Ruston,"Apr 26, 2020 at 6:15 AM",5,Great Game,"**Did you notice it looks like their support has responded to most of the reviews thus far. Says good things about their team.**

To begin with, it's a bit of a pain to have to download the app and jump through the hoops there when it doesn't seem like a phone is necessary at all. 
Also, I really do not like the fact that it's subscription model, but a free month is certainly nice. 
That said, It's very nicely polished and plays great on the quest. I've only done the intro then straight to the hardest ""pro"" mix. Holy cow it's awesome. 

I play beat saber, Box VR, and thrill of the fight regularly for exercise. This is an excellent mashup of box vr and beat saber. 
  Box VR is a great workout, but it's not designed to trip you up mentally like Beat saber is, it also doesn't havn't a lot of squats. Where as beat saber is just a fun game. 
   Supernatural throws all the fun balls at you to hit in difficult angles, like beat saber, but at a pace much like box vr and it encourages strong purposeful hits like Box VR. The squatting and side lunging is very nicely done. 
    The environments are spectacular, though I don't care much for background aesthetics. 
     After finishing the first song in the pro workout I was panting. They've done a great job. The fact that there's a coach there challenging you to keep up the pace is icing on the cake. 

All that said, I can see getting bored with it if you're looking for a fun engaging game. It's a workout engine and as such it's going to get repetitive just like box vr once you do it enough. 

Oh, and they sent me an email offering me a free Quest sweat liner. That's cool of them!"

2487,Ecogstage,"May 15, 2020 at 6:15 PM",5,Best Quest workout game so far,"I'm going to disagree with the other reviews so far that heavily discuss the possible future monthly charges. That is a separate component of a game review and it should be discussed but should not impact your scoring of a game's content.  Do I think that this game is overpriced if you plan on using it for a year? Probably. Do I think most people are going to use this or any other game regularly for a year? No. The vast majority of users will likely play this game and have fun for a couple months and given the 1-month free trial and the monthly pricing, you will spend less on this game for more hours of fun than most other Oculus games. 

As for the content of this game, I think it is fantastic. I have beatsaber, all the boxing games and some of the music rhythm games but this easily trumps them all in terms of a workout. The workout is more dynamic, the coaches are motivating without being  intrusive and there is new content on the reg. It connects pretty well with my apple watch and it is a better workout than BoxVR. I think it likely tracks worse than beatsaber but I also think it requires more precise swings than other similar games. However, this game has you moving around the room and rotating far more than every other game so I give it some leeway. As well, it has actually recognizable songs which I find much more enjoyable than the random beats in the other games. I often singalong while working out. 

I do not think the game is flawless but it is innovative, fun and an entirely better workout experience than any other quest game by a significant margin."

What's My Age Again: This state looks down on s****y.

I Write Sins Not Tragedies: The bridesmaid is a W***e... close the G** D**n door.

What's My Name Again pops up, good song, it gets to the line above, and the word in question (s****y) is replaced with a nonsense word; I think, ""OK, maybe kids are using this? That's not really a bad word, and censorship is annoying, but not a big deal."" 

The very next song is I Write Sins Not Tragedies, also a good song, but W***e and G** D*** aren't censored, so yeah, clearly not edited for the children, it was quite obviously edited to make the ""this state looks down on"" part more PC.

Censoring the past is not alright, but if you're gonna do it, be consistent, and for the love of all that is Holy, do not edit the past specifically to have it match up with your modern PC sensibilities.

The subscription is worth the money, but I'm not going to support you editing the past; good luck.

That said; if you reply to this saying that it was the publishers you license with that do the selective censorship, and you have no say, then I'll restart my sub; I do like the app, and I'm not like to punish you for what you're corporate overlords are doing.

I got it on Monday, and I've used the ""Workout of the Day"" every night since.

So far I'm loving it; same feel as Beatsaber, but while Beatsaber is about beating the songs, Supernatural is about playing them.

The music is good, the coaches are great, and the pace for new content is amazing; if they keep up the pace with the new workouts, then it's well worth the price."

Every VR fitness game I've played continuously adds free content to the game and they all only do one time fees. $20 a month or even $10 a month is such an insane amount of money for a VR game its mind boggling how the devs thought this was a good idea. Gameplay is fine and it's a decent workout but the idea of having to spend $240 a year (and still not even own it than) just to play a game I've already bought is so ridiculous. Fix the broken price scheme and just make new content dlc because the current state of the game is a greedy joke and you should be ashamed. And before you compare this game to a gym membership, keep in mind gyms have tons of equipment, staff, and other amenities for you to enjoy. Gyms also have to worry about paying rent for their physical location and even with all of that cost you can get a Planet Fitness membership for $10 a month. The developers got greedy and now they're hiding behind an excuse that they have to do they monthly subscription to pay trainers and choreographers when no other VR fitness games have the same problem. If you think bestsaber and pistol whip dont have choreographers to help them make new songs than you dont know anything about game design and they both push out new content for free all the time. What a laughably bad excuse for a game"

The songs really get you moving and I’ve had a couple great workouts; the game takes full advantage of the 360 environment and had me spinning, lunging, etc, definitely make sure you have enough room to play.
The scenery is also beautiful. Several locations that are crystal clear, really looking forward to seeing what else comes. New workouts appear to be made available daily. 
I am still under the initial 30 day trial period and at this point do see myself considering paying for this monthly. $20 per month is NOT cheap, but if the daily content and coach interaction continues, along with additional backgrounds and new music, I can see where this will be worth it."
2496,Jack,"Apr 24, 2020 at 3:58 AM",5,Incredible experience!,Best workout experience in Vr. It has what all the others (box vr beat saber) we’re lacking. Squates cardio and everything else you’d need. Will definitely consider subscribing by the end of the month. Hope new content is added frequently.
2497,Terrence,"May 2, 2020 at 1:19 PM",5,Updated Review,"Great concept but needs refinement. I like a lot about Supernatural.  I like the music. The coaches. I like that it dynamically scales to your skill level.  It has several flaws that make it unenjoyable from a workout perspective.

There are too many crossovers. You hold a white bat in your right hand and a black bat in your right.  Several times throughout a song you will have to hit the cones on the opposite side.  This may not sound like a big problem but it really takes you out of the rhythm. This is fine for games like beat saber where you just play the same song over and over mastering the tricky parts. Supernatural should be more like a fun groove that gets your heart rate up. There shouldn't be trick swings. Every swing should fill like a natural extension of the next. 

The next problem has to do with the Quest hardware. Because it tracks your controller with cameras it has some blind spots.  You'll notice this a lot with overhead swings.  The mappers really need to pay attention to how they want people to move to avoid the headset losing track of people's controllers. Hopefully they are paying attention to which cones people miss the most and adjusting how they map the songs to increase flow and enjoyment.   

Otherwise this is a pretty great app.  Plenty of good songs.  Halfway decent maps. New workouts daily. It doesn't support fitbit which is another downside though. I've cancelled my membership but I'll renew from time to time to see if they've improved the flow of the mapping."
2498,DylanJesseDale,"Jun 15, 2020 at 11:58 PM",5,Just paid for my first month.,"The 30 days were up and I decided it is worth it. Not only that but since I started my paid sub I have that extra motivation to use the product and get my money's worth. The workouts are solid. More physical than BS or BoxVR. More movement variety and every workout is 360 deg.  The trainers have turned out to be better than I thought. Coach Doc with his meditations at the end of the workout and Leanne, well just being Leanne, is awesome. You could put together your own work out with other beat games but this is not a game. This is a gameified workout. The emphasis does seem to be on getting an actual workout. If it turns out to be fun as well... bonus. The music spans from the 80s to 2020 so even this 50 year old dude can sing along to some of these. :) Anyway, as an early doubter I am now sold. Literally."
2499,ejsphilly,"Jun 15, 2020 at 9:58 PM",5,Game changer for non workout family,"UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW: I can't say enough how much Supernatural has changed my life. I feel connected to the coaches, and my fellow athletes, and it motivates me to keep going. I can't believe how much I sweat with every workout. I recently got an Apple Watch and am now loving the additional functionality to show my heart rate. It's so amazing to have a PORTABLE gym that you can move to different rooms in your house. At this point, Supernatural probably has been used about 80% of the total time I use my VR glasses. Love all the music but KEEP THE RETRO HITS COMING! :-) 

Thanks Leanne, and Raneir, and Antonio, and the entire team for bringing it every day and helping me to discover an athlete inside me that I never knew was there.

Supernatural has been the best thing to come out of my purchase of the Oculus Quest VR glasses. I was skeptical about the price point at first, but each day I found myself checking out the new lessons, many which are considerably challenging. But the music choices (especially the retro) really keeps me and my 10 and 12 year old daughters motivated, and I’m always amazed at how much I’m sweating after each lesson! Feel motivated by the instructors. Keep the gorgeous locations coming, too! Curious as to how expansive your music library is in the months to follow! Also, appreciate the low intensity workouts so keep those coming, too! 

Thanks Supernatural Team!"

2501,Cam,"May 16, 2020 at 4:51 AM",5,(Was) Kicking my BUTT!.. UPDATED,"Updates:

Ok.. something fixed it.. its working again.  They did a few updates so maybe that fixed it.  I would like it if they had levels that you could choose from.. hard, med, easy.  There are days where I really like the songs but they have it for an easy pace.. which just bores me.. hahaha. I'd love to be able to speed it up so I could get a better workout.

Not sure what happened to the tracking but mine gets lost all the time lately which totally slows down the game!  I can't even play now that its going so slow.  I can see my bat going thru the thing but its acting like its not hitting it and then the game slows it down for me.  I can't do anything with it going that slow!  Its been getting worse the more I play this.. it was really good at a first but now I get so frustrated that I have to stop the game and go play something else that makes me work out.  Hopefully you guys can fix this because I've re-calibrated this on my side and its not helping.

I'm having a blast with this!  I wanted something to give me a workout and this is doing it!  I haven't had any issues with it loading or playing.. its been great!  I really like the instructors working with you along the way.  I've never really done a Jazzercise class but this is how I am picturing how it would be.. haha. (besides hitting the things).   I was always more into weights and never really thought I could do this cardio thing but out in my own yard.. yeah baby!  I've really needed some cardio and this has hit the spot!  I've been doing it 2x/day for 40 min for the last 4 days and hopefully will continue till I go back to work in 30 days.  I can finally feel my endorphins!  My ratings for a good workout are: this first, then synthriders, beat saber and lastly, for me, boxing VR.   Not sure if I will pay the $19/month.. possibly $8  but for right now I'm having a blast!  You go Leanne!"
2502,kie,"Jun 15, 2020 at 2:09 AM",5,REVIEW FOR FITNESS ENTHUSIASTS,"SUMMARY OF PERSPECTIVE:
My review is primarily aimed at those who want insights into whether this service can help improve their fitness.

SUMMARY OF REVIEW:
Supernatural’s cost may make it worthwhile only for those interested in exercising regularly through a subscription service that {a} stresses the upper body through a full range of motion, {b} stresses the lower body through squats and lateral lunges, and {c} provides an evolving range of popular music.

SUMMARY OF MECHANICS/DIFFICULTY:
Supernatural’s “hard” is most analogous to Beat Saber’s “hard” and sometimes “expert” but almost never “expert+”. While Supernatural’s mechanics are similar to Beat Saber’s, it’s goals/focus as an exercise program is different from Beat Saber’s as a rhythm game. It does not try to stress mechanical dexterity through complex patterns or flashing speed; instead it tries to stress fitness through patterns that require {a} a full range of motion, {b} squats and lateral lunges, and {c} a full 360 degrees of rotation (your shoulders and quads may ache but your wrists should never be sore).

SUMMARY OF MUSIC:
Music is a mix of mostly contemporary music (pop, rock, hip hop, rap, etc) and some “ancient” music (classic rock, punk, etc). Of all the rhythm games available on VR, Supernatural seems to have the broadest selection of popular songs (hence its relatively high cost) and has been adding more weekly.

SUMMARY OF “GUIDED” SESSIONS:
Similar to BoxVR, Supernatural has coaches who introduce and “guide” the sessions. How much value the coaches add to the experience will depend on the individual. My experience ranged from neutral (i.e. commentary was just background noise) to slightly positive (i.e. commentary was interesting/encouraging).

SUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE:
I exercise extensively (2-3 hours daily) through a variety of rhythm games. I generally exercise through routines on the highest difficulty; consequently, my opinions may not be accurate for routines on lower difficulty."
2503,Sarachan,"May 10, 2020 at 10:25 PM",5,I love this!,"I do a Supernatural workout at least once a day, sometimes twice.  It is a great way to exercise with zero friction to get into it...  Just put on the Quest and go.  (Especially during Coronavirus, with gyms closed, this is very welcome!)  The first few times I had sore muscles and had trouble keeping up.  After getting used to it, my muscles are less sore, and I am better at keeping up with the patterns, but certainly am not perfect; there is still plenty of challenge.  I disagree with reviews that say this is a Beat Saber clone.  Although the mechanics are similar, Supernatural is much different and much more.  Beat Saber is a game.  If you miss a few targets, the round stops, whereas for Supernatural the goal is the workout.  The round does not stop if some targets are missed.  The addition of squats and lunges makes a tremendous difference in the cardio workout.  The Supernatural trainers emphasize using full body or full arms rather than just wrists.  The beautiful environments, familiar songs, and ""virtual"" personal trainers all make a big difference.  For me it makes a workout something I look forward to and that breaks up a working-from-home quarantine day.   (And frankly most of the songs in BS are not to my taste.)
Data speaks more than words.  I just ran through the Joy workout, using my Fitbit to measure heartrate.  Average level: 128, peak level: 156.  I don't think I get to these levels playing any VR games.
Would I pay the $20 / month subscription fee?  Yes, because I get something from Supernatural every day.
Wish list for future improvements:  Continued daily new workouts including new songs, Fitbit integration."
2504,Happy A,"Jul 5, 2020 at 9:57 PM",4,Love it but would like some improvement,"I am really enjoying this app as an addition to my other activities - tennis, weight training. Would love to be able to pause a workout so that it can be restarted later on in the day, or just do a partial workout. Perhaps these options are available , not sure. I would  also love to be able to select workouts based on the type of music as well, and the environment. For example, high intensity , rap and rock music, in Iceland, for instance . I really liked the meditation at the end of today’s workout, and would love to see more stretching and meditation sessions. Having lots of fun with it!"
2505,Francis Jonas Yap,"Jun 2, 2020 at 1:25 AM",4,Some bugs still but great,"I also need to quit and restart several times for the app to work.  The app also has issue with detecting floor level accurately.  So, it often makes you floating in mid-air until you restart the app again in order to fix this problem.  

It would be nice to show you a video/animation of what you need to do during the exercise.  Music column is a bit too soft for an exercise program.  

I sure hope they will improve it.  So far, it is getting tiring and boring pretty quickly.  The music used is not very motivating as well."
2506,FlyingWaffle,"Apr 27, 2020 at 6:43 PM",5,,"I've been doing all my workout in VR for over a year now, with Beat Saber (hard to make it a true workout, because it's really focused on scoring, not on form), Pistol Whip (good for the legs), and The Thrill of the Fight (this is one is very intense, but there's absolutely no guidance on how to do it right).

But Supernatural is the VR work out I've been waiting for.  
I've been doing it 4 days in a row now (since I signed up for the free trial), and I'm planning to do it every morning, after I wake up.
It's really intense without being stressful or frustrating. A single session is enough to leave me totally sweaty, out of breath, and in a good mood.
Hitting the orbs requires some real extension, you can't fake it by just drumming with the controllers (like in Beat Saber), it's not based on memorization either because each workout session is an unpredictable mix of tracks, and that keeps things very fresh and exciting each time.
The trainers are great at motivating me and remind me to focus on my breath, and they keep things very positive.
The scenery is awesome and varied.
I was happy to see that some of the tracks are pop classics (like ""Boogie Shoes"").

About pricing, to me it's okay - if I do it every day (and I probably will), one workout session is basically 0.67 $, less than the price of a small bag of potato chips from a vending machine.

On the negative side, occasionally the hits don't register when they should, although it's not as annoying as in other games because this is not about achieving perfection, it's about intensity. 
But this is probably a generic issue with Quest tracking limitations (present in pretty much all Quest games to some degree) that could be improved.

So, overall, I'm really happy this exists."
2507,Ian,"Apr 27, 2020 at 9:03 PM",5,Like Apple decided to make Beat Saber,"UPDATE: Still greatly enjoying this a few days later. Glad this is the case.

To be honest, when it comes to workout apps on VR, I feel like I had to choose between doing something fun or getting in a good workout. With Supernatural I don’t feel like I have to choose anymore. If you’re looking for more of a fitness app similar to exercise classes based on some rhythm (like Zumba), then this is perfect. It feels super polished and is one of the best workout apps on the Quest in my opinion. I was worried it would be just a reskinned Beat Saber, but Supernatural really is just a different experience altogether.

All in all, I really enjoyed it a lot. Now I know part of it is a novelty factor with it being new so I’ll have to see how I feel after playing the songs/courses after a few weeks, but I will say that this app has really hit it out of the park for me. My suggestion would be to give it a chance - it does have a 30-day free trial after all. If you don't feel like it's worth paying for then don't pay for it. But I think many people will be pleasantly surprised."
2508,Richard,"Jun 14, 2020 at 4:39 PM",5,Most fun you can have with clothes on,"Pros: 
actual full body workouts, cool relaxing locations, wide choice of music. 

Cons; 
controller tracking is occassinally rubbish enough to break you out of flow as it intermittently loses a controller; not sure if this is the dev's fault or the quest itself is somehow struggling with movement patterns that are both extreme and different in style from beat saber, but definitely worse tracking than beat sabre so they need to work with oculus on this.
Trainer feedback does not seem personalised to you which one might hope for given the price.

Price; contravertial but not unreasonable for the value it offers if they keep up the pace of new music and routines and improve trainer feedback personalisation. Despite the inevitable beat sabre comparison, you should think of this vs a pelaton sub, or gym membership rather than vs a game. If you find you use it daily, its worth it and its easy enough to find out with the 30 day trial. Only thing i find a bit cheap is the lack of family linked accounts on the same main device. Not going to pay twice for my wife, so just irritates by mixing up our data tracking."
2509,MrsFessel,"Apr 25, 2020 at 6:20 AM",5,Just a middle aged momma also a gamer!,"Amazing quick customer support. The ability to comment to other players. The leaderboard. It sync to your Apple Watch. Overall, this is an extremely well made game. $20 a month is not bad considering it adds workouts daily! No $9 fee to just get 4 new workouts on a game like another one... These are full body and engaging. For the person that needs a kick up and has got used to boxvr and beatsaber this is for you! I actually feel challenged!!!! My legs, core, and arms are sore from just 2 days. This is exactly what I needed! This game is going to far pass the other fitness games!!"
2510,jb,"May 31, 2020 at 10:15 PM",3,"Very cool, but $$$$","I agree with the other reviewers...overpriced but cool. 

Cool concept, good execution, not much content yet but I’m sure it will come. Apple Watch integration for the heart rate is very good... I got my heart rate up to the same as a 5k run. 

￼It does require a pretty good sized space and play area. Beat saber style play with better graphics and human coaching. 

The price is probably too steep for a startup. especially when compared to peloton and other apps. Unless they can get the price down to about $10 I’m probably out after the trial. 
Nice work though!"
2511,Easy Mac,"Apr 26, 2020 at 8:06 PM",5,Pricey but great quality,"So first thing I’ll say is I totally understand why people are upset about $20 a month. I think something like $10 a month is more reasonable. 

That being said I’ve tried multiple workout games on the quest and this is the first one I actually have gotten into. It’s great quality and actually pretty fun. My wife and I have done this every day since release. We will see if the workouts pay off, but personally if I continue to do this every day I think it will be worth it. Love the music selection, love the views, and love the gameplay. Actually break a sweat and have feel the burn. 

Would recommend to anyone just hoping they figure out the pricing."
2512,Mike S,"Jun 11, 2020 at 5:51 AM",5,Great start but must get more robust,"All well but definitely needs subsets of workouts. Have to get creative- planking, boxing, jump rope - needs lots more but an awesome beginning. If its same thing in a year- it wont be around."
2513,Kellric,"May 9, 2020 at 2:55 AM",5,Awesome,"Best workout on the Quest.  Definitely feeling burn in my muscles.  The coaches and music are great.

The key thing is this is not a game, it's a workout, like going to a class.  The coaches are there to guide and encourage like in a real exercise class.

The subscription is cheaper than a live class and there's way more variety

Only thing missing is support for more devices like Garmin and Fitbit."
2514,PACKAGEMAN17,"Apr 24, 2020 at 2:43 AM",1,Bitter Disappointment,"Wow, did they ever mess this app up. A cool idea ruined by a long list of shortcomings. To name a few: you can only pick workouts not songs, you can't mute the trainers' voices, you can't disable 360 motion, you can't change balloon colors, there is a warmup at the beginning of each workout, you can't change difficulty, and the maps are constantly repeated without selection options. And even if all of those things were perfect, IT'S A SUBSCRIPTION. An expensive one at that. What a joke. I'm a young guy with expendible income that loves to regularly play BeatSaber on expert and I've been eagerly waiting for this to be released based on the trailer. I was willing to pay a decent amount of money to buy it when it came out. Not only will I not be paying for their ludicrous subscription, I will be canceling my trial as it is not even worth my time."
2515,FPVgan,"Jun 13, 2020 at 6:44 AM",5,Excellent and worth the money for me,Obviously the monthly subscription is steep but the licensed music keeps me motivated and engaged. The instructors and environments are outstanding and it kicks my butt every time.
2516,VRruss2020,"Jul 8, 2020 at 8:41 PM",2,Would like if I could try more,"As I'm a uk user I wint give this a good review brought it to the uk with a decent pricing model. People in UK won't pay more than £4.99 a month for this.


Sort these 2 things out you will get a 5.

Also the training isn't enough of a taste of this gane I would include 1 or 2 workouts after training modules."
2517,Paradoxical,"Apr 26, 2020 at 1:52 AM",5,Amazing!,"Let’s be clear: this is not for everyone. This is much more of a fitness class or a discount personal trainer program than a game. If you already have a fitness routine that works for you or if you regularly attend classes at a gym, then you probably won’t value this. I’m at a point in my life where, due to work and kids, I find it very difficult to schedule fitness classes, go to the gym, or schedule personal trainer appointments. I mostly use my quest for exercise. I have trouble motivating myself to run or do traditional cardio. Supernatural is perfect for me. It is fun, much more so than competing vr exercise programs like boxvr. It is much better and more well rounded exercise than games like beatsaber. And it is so much cheaper than a personal trainer (when I had more time, I used to spend several hundred a month on personal training). This is not going to be as good exercise as a personal trainer or a good fitness class at a gym, but it is so much more convenient for those of us with excessively busy schedules. Time will tell if this will offer enough variety to keep me engaged in the long run. But, for now, this is my favorite new thing."
2518,yungus,"Apr 25, 2020 at 9:14 PM",5,5 Stars Across the Board,"This game has it all. The visuals are spectacular and the overall flow of the experience makes it quite addicting. The level of concentration mixed with the fun and engaging atmosphere will have you sweating and forgetting that you’re even working out. Your whole body will feel the burn after 20 minutes. For the people complaining about $19/mo, who cares? This is a commitment to health and fitness and if $240/year is not worth being your best, then spend it at a McDonald’s."
2519,Tpeapudeu,"Jul 21, 2020 at 7:02 PM",4,Great app but no monthly is better,This is a great exercise app. The visuals are outstanding. It's great to have a coach helping you along. The only problem I have is paying $20 monthly. It's not worth that cost. I would purchase it right out.
2520,Pox,"May 13, 2020 at 12:51 AM",5,Don't treat it like a game.,"Real talk, this isn't a game it's a fitness app. If you don't take it seriously or really make an effort to follow along with the trainer's instructions you're not going to get much out of it and you'll probably walk away thinking it's nothing more than another rhythm game. 

If you're balking at the price then consider this. You're not paying for a game, you're paying for a gym membership. I'd love for the developers to do more with weight/nutrition tracking via the companion app and have videos suggesting meal prep and other forms of physical fitness. Hell, even a scheduled class would be cool if people could compete with each other while the trainer is interacting with the group.

I'll update this in a month if/when I decide to buy in after my trial but for right now I'm a fan."
2521,Charles,"May 8, 2020 at 7:24 AM",5,I love the Workouts,"I am well into my trial and I love doing the workouts.  I   I am competing with two family members so that pushes me to do it everyday to stay on top the leaderboard.   I love the music, the workouts, and the trainers.    Of course I want it to be cheaper, but if the quality of the workouts stay on par with what I have done so far it might just be worth it.   

For those comparing the price to other games.  This is not a game.  It’s really like having a personal trainer.   You will sweat more than you ever did in Best Saber or Box VR.   If nothing else I totally recommend the trial.   If you don’t like it after that there is nothing loss in trying."
2522,Alex,"May 3, 2020 at 8:41 PM",5,Less then 0.67 cents per day,I 1st gave it one star because the app would not work I contacted the developers and with their help I got a start it. This is one of the best fitness apps for the Quest!. Alot of people are complaining about the $20.00 a month subscription its 0.65 cents per day and if you follow your trainer it well give you a great workout! Beat saber is a great game but doesn't come close to the workout you get from supernatural
2523,NMS,"May 4, 2020 at 9:44 AM",5,Love the full body work out,"I love this work out. I am in a full sweat when I am done. I feel the full body workout every time and in different areas. In the beginning I wasn’t fast enough to nail all targets but I keep doing it everyday and I became faster, stronger and am able to keep up now. For those of you who say you can’t hit the targets that well and blame the game it’s probably because you can’t handle it and you need to keep working hard. I think it’s worth the $19 a month and I plan on paying. For you people to say that paying it is laughable is disgusting. People work hard on these games and you wouldn’t have them if they didn’t.  I love VR and am willing to support these games any way I can. Everyone has to make a living. I can’t wait for more songs. You have a great variety and I feel like I can take on the day after a couple routines. Keep up the great work."
2524,bandit,"Apr 25, 2020 at 12:56 PM",5,Love it so far!,"I’ve played a lot of boxVR, beat saber and pistol whip over the last year - but this is a better workout for me.

I also really love the visual style, and I prefer the music to a lot of what is available in other games. I also like the trainer presence and surprisingly find them helpful (I thought that part might not be for me!).

I know a lot of people struggle with the idea, but the subscription model equates to a gym membership to me. And I really have never been able to drag myself into gyms, but beautiful landscapes? Yes please. So this is definitely worth it for me. 

As long as it means the team can add content, great music and keep it fresh then it makes sense to me. Good luck to the dev team!"
2525,DadaMax,"Aug 24, 2020 at 11:23 PM",3,Seems cool. Aint free though,Love it. However claiming it's free is quite misleading.
2526,znanney,"May 12, 2020 at 4:52 PM",5,Worth it! (For me),"This isn't a game so much as a solid workout app. Sure, we can compare to Beat Saber, BoxVR, or Synth Riders, but those are games. This app is very well polished and using a Garmin fitness tracker, Supernatural provides a much better workout than other VR games. The daily workouts, excellent tracks, beautiful environments, and the trainers in my ear really help with the motivation. I'm mostly sedentary and this app keeps me coming back daily for more. 

I see a lot of people talking about the $240 a year, but that's not what it is. You're not signing an annual contract and if there's a month where you're not feeling it, cancel and resume at a later date. 

This app is all about perspective and it's definitely not for everyone, just like not everyone enjoys the gym, not everyone subscribes to Peloton or Spotify. 

Do the free trial, see if it's for you, and move on. Regardless of how anyone feels about the subscription model, the app is so well done with top notch music it's worth experiencing and you've got a full 30 days to see what it's about. 

At this point in time, the app is worth it to me. Maybe later if I'm looking for more, that value will change, but I haven't spent a penny on it yet and it's one of the only apps I'm currently using on the Quest."
2527,megosoftwindows,"Jun 16, 2020 at 9:00 PM",4,Music,"I really love this workout app.  I am a 50 year old Mom who is pretty out of shape and fairly uncoordinated, but I can actually do the low intensity workouts! My main complaint is the lack of workouts that contain music that I want to work out to. The retrofits are great, but there are only 3 of them.  I'd love to find more workouts with classic rock or pop from the 60-90's."
2528,Spetka,"May 3, 2020 at 7:17 AM",5,"I’m horrible at it, but...","Here’s the thing. For a gamer, my hand eye coordination is pretty much trash. I cannot register which hand is which when they start throwing like a million of those things at me. I thought this would discourage me. I thought seeing myself at the bottom of a leader board over and over again would be the death of me. Something about this app is different though. Many of the exercises adjust to your pace without letting you tap the breaks completely. Instead of fighting my own ego, I’m setting goals of getting out of bronze. I am my own worst mental enemy, but the way this is set up, seriously negates that’s. I’m not even sure how. I am absolutely astounded that I’m more sore from this then I was from the gym. You think the first day, okay I did break a sweat, but come on. It has a way of working absolutely everything. You don’t even really realize till you start to feel sore. I thought, okay this is cool but how much can it really work all of my body. It just does. Go for it. As a person who has given up on my own fitness time and time again because I can’t meet my own ridiculous expectations, this is the medicine for that. It’s got a certain charm and incentive I haven’t found anywhere else (and I have sure as heck wasted the money trying). Kick in to the new wave of home fitness. I promise you’re muscles, whole body and mind won’t regret a thing.


All that being said. There are a few things I have to say are drawbacks.

-There is some inconsistency in hitting the targets. There are times, even on slow warm ups where I continually do the same thing and sometimes it hits, sometimes it doesn’t. Lighting up the room a lot is good for it, but this still happens quite consistently.
-I know I’m bad, but there needs to be a little give for people who are not great with registering targets close together and switching non stop. When you have three opening portals having you switch your way around non stop it just gets a bit overwhelming if you just kind of suck at it. I just focus on the things I can remember the most and the difficult adjusts overtime sometimes. But I start strong because sometimes they beginning pace is just perfect, then it cranks it up 10 notches and my solid pace turns into a panic. It takes a while for it to back off again, if it ever does. The dynamic difficulty is cool, but I think there needs to be a real push to target how much people can handle the rapid pace. Give a few more options for more controlled starts and work outs rather than just beginners only. I hate feeling like if I do well right out the gate, that means in about 20 seconds I’m gonna be overwhelmed by targets again. I want a strong experience all the way through for more of the workouts without redoing “beginners only”.
- The trainers are a bit much. It does an incredible job of syncing your hits to the beat, and hearing somewhat consistent talking through it is annoying. Sure I want some type of tips here and there, but there needs to be some way to adjust how often they talk, if at all. It seems nit-picky, but part of what really keeps me going is when I’ve got the words in my head, I’ve figured out the pattern and I just want to go for it.
- Some more explanation on the power stat would help a ton. I focus on it non stop to try and see what I’m doing to get it up. I like power. It really gives me more out of the workout, but an in game guided something to help you understand how it’s calculated and give you some calibrated feed back would be incredible. I don’t want to cheat the system. I just want the power to be accurate to the amount I can really do individually. I want to see where these numbers come from because while they kind of make sense now, I do believe this could be done better.
- The cool downs make little sense in game. I don’t want to rock back my head back and forth and do all that with my headset on, but maybe that’s just me. What I would love to see is a guided cool down once you take off the headset with the app. If you are tacking, have it after you hold stop tracking. If not, just have a little section that is populated given the workout(s) you completes that session. Then it can be longer and more targeted at what you did for the whole workout."
2529,dansker,"May 27, 2020 at 7:33 PM",4,Close to brilliant,"Rather pleased with my daily workouts in SuperNatural.

I'm not into crowd games,  the one-on-one experience suits me perfectly, and I have no doubt SuperNatural will help shed some of these pandemic pounds.

The Daily workout are awesome,  I love the feeling that there are a fresh flow of new content.

You all know this is a hit the balls and dodge obstacles game.. nuff said, but its well done on that part.. try it, the first 30 days are free, you can afford it.

I feel the levels can be hard to pick and the AUTO level - just not sensitive enough to make it fun.  I fit somewhere between light and medium.. and can handle a burst of high, if it drops back to light quickly LOL.  
I would like some light-medium 20-30min packages.  but thats just me.

Why is there not a power feedback, a tweak in sound if its a high power hit.?

The ""trainers"" need to go back and revisit the episodes,  We get ""Duck down on those triangles"" when there are no triangles..   ""ready for series of pairs"" when there are no series of anything pairs.. 

Feature requests.
SuperNatural to go,  let me download todays tape, or a couple of older workouts for a weekend trip. (or a week)

Option to loose the background for the quest cameras B&W background for exercising in the garden while having situational awareness. 

The ""OMG $20""  is just noise, I can't take it serious,  how can people get that disheveled over less than the cost of 4 latte's ?   and realistically,  just spring for the annual subscription which brings it to $13 a month,  you need to stay in shape longer than 30 days.

If you have not downloaded and tried SuperNatural yet.. you are missing out on a great VR workout."
2530,Mark,"Apr 28, 2020 at 5:00 AM",5,An actual workout,"I never write reviews but I felt I had to here. Anyone who is saying this is a beat saber clone or another music rhythm game is not understanding what this is. You aren’t hitting blocks in tune with music, you are doing a workout tailored to you individually. Difficulty ramps up based on how you’re doing, and the workouts are designed not to test your rhythm or accuracy but to make your entire body move the way it would in a real workout. 

It’s not a game. You can’t go into it expecting to play a game. Go into it the same way you would a spin class or a condition class. You won’t be disappointed."

2534,Unhedged,"May 11, 2020 at 10:18 PM",4,Good aerobics but...,"The concept and intent are excellent. Can certainly make aerobic exercise more interesting. Its definitely in its infancy in terms of its depth and breadth of offering. I can really see the potential when its fully realized, but it is not there for 19.95 per month. Putting Beat Saber on the higher difficulty gets 75% of the benefit.
Would i pay 240/year for nicer VR locales and some human coaching? Maybe if there were other forms of work out in the program, and it was shareable.
Its simply hard to imagine many people paying 40/month in order to allow ones partner to shate the Oculus and have their own user profile since right now only one allowed.
For an early stage beta concept with so e potential, 480/ year per couple is just not going to work. Other services, Peloton etc  offer workouts across multiple formats and in a myriad of ways.
Supernatural is essentially one exercise with different music. Thats not 40/month per couple. So...
My advice would be to price this at the beta level it is until there is to s more content and choice and it allows for at least 2 users
Great concept, looks good, but limited and overpriced for now. Fingers crossed."

What i would like from a workout perspective, is to have various categories sorted by the intensity of the workout and duration.  If i want a quick and easy workout or a long workout.  
Another great feature would be maybe a timer after each song finishes.  Knowing how long you got left or how many songs are left to completion.  
Finally the price is abit high as of now, Given the current amount of backdrops, sounds and workouts.  When the free month is over, we would expect a larger library, or cheaper price.

2540,Kristin,"May 21, 2020 at 4:41 AM",4,Great experience,"Here's my updated review after using the app for almost a month. 

1. Overall, it's an enjoyable experience. I often go in for one workout and stay for two. It's a great way to move if I haven't had time to get outside and do some ""real"" exercise. 

2. As far as exercise goes - it does get my heart rate up, but only to around 115 bpm. Unfortunately, my heart rate tracker (a Fitbit) isn't supported by the app, so I have to check my watch between songs. In comparison, I've gotten up to 130 bmp on Box VR. I wouldn't use the app to replace regular exercise, but it's definitely better than nothing. And, it's fun, so I'm motivated to use it.  

UPDATE: I actually got up to 155 bpm during my Supernatural workout yesterday. I find that the better I get at using the program, the better a workout I'm able to get.

3. I love the backgrounds! Some are so realistic that I practically feel like I could reach down and touch the water. Nearly each time I've played, there's been a new place to go. This variety and the beauty keeps me coming back, more so than any other exercise app. Really hope the company makes it a priority to keep adding new locations.  

4. I actually like the fact that I can't choose specific songs or places, just workouts. This means I'm basically in for a surprise and it takes away the stress of having to decide. 

5. The music, in my opinion, is not great. I'd like it if the workouts were organized by genre, so that I could at least select workouts that were more likely to have music I like. I'm in the process of trying to figure out if a particular coach has similar tastes in music to me. 

Is it worth $19 a month? That does seem expensive compared to other games, but on the other hand, it's way less than one dinner out and a lot healthier. I'm inclined to jump on the annual sale they're offering until the end of May, which makes the price a bit more palatable. I can't be sure it will still grab my attention months down the road, but I like what the company has done and want them to stay in business."
2541,sdeiuliis,"May 5, 2020 at 4:00 AM",5,I hated working out until Supernatural,"At one point in my life I enjoyed working out... but that was 10 years ago. I never thought I would actually enjoy working out again, and then I found Supernatural. I love the coaches, especially Ranier! I’ve have to say, the quality of Supernatural is not only superior to that of any other VR Fitness app, but I’d go as far as saying any VR app. It’s truly beautiful. I also highly respect that Supernatural is licensing the music from labels. The new workouts keep things fresh and exciting. I love that I can workout from home and I’m excited that I’ll be able to take it with me when I start to travel again!"
2542,Pruisim,"May 5, 2020 at 8:21 AM",5,Amazing App,"Fantastic app similar to beat saber but way different it is much more of a workout and I leave dripping sweat. You should be able to chose your workout by category easy, medium etc. because the dynamic learning mode is garbage and your half way through exhausted from all the lunges and squats but it doesn’t slow down for a second. So either you feel like your soul is crushed cause there is no way to catch up or your like me and just stand there till the feeling of throwing up subsides and you keep going. I also notice when I get tired my form gets horrible my lunges are off and my knee starts hurting but it doesn’t slow down. It should learn when your tired when you start missing the orbs and actually either slow down orrrr reduce how many squats you do till you can actually catch up. Another tip hand tracking would be great because sometimes the tracking gets lost on faster songs and you think you have a bat in your hand but it’s just floating there. Overall good app and if I truly lose fat you’ve got my $20 a month. Note: you should be able to pay for a full year at a discount up front.... you will probably get more subscribers that way."
2543,austin.chappell,"Apr 24, 2020 at 7:25 AM",5,This is a blast,"This game is probably the best one I’ve played so far. It’s entertaining, gets you moving, upbeat music, and great scenic environments. Speaking as a software developer and a musician, these guys nailed it."

Having trainers there definitely a good concept . Kudos to the designers and developers, but...., the price point is very steep. $200 for one year? You can’t help comparing the value with other apps that give comparable value for a fraction of that.  I think $5/month fee is reasonable. BTW, I talked with many people who tried it. Everybody liked it, but not one was enthusiastic enough to say yes I will subscribe."
2545,Barkin,"May 15, 2020 at 10:41 PM",5,Works for me!,"The only way this is worth the money is it gets you working out more than you would using other apps. So far for me, it has. I had tried to construct a workout out of Beat Saber and BoxVR but it didn't stick. 

Supernatural has a couple of things that has gotten me doing it every day. Better songs, I mean I like thumping techno actually, but this has way better variety. Human trainer, it might feel a touch gimmicky but it does genuinely help me come back. Variable difficulty, I'm still not sure how it works but from a heart rate perspective it does, it gets me into a good high heart rate zone and keeps me there for the workout. New playlists everyday, rather than have to think what I want to do, I just do the new playlist each day. EZ goals.

I'd say try the free 30 days, if you are actually using it, sub up and if not don't."
2546,AdmiralPatton,"Aug 3, 2020 at 12:47 AM",5,Perfect Workout,Very fun and challenging
2547,dylan.horowitz,"May 23, 2020 at 10:01 AM",2,I played this every day for 1 month...,"Tl;dr - this is a okay fitness game that they’re trying to sell as a gym substitute, which it isn’t, while also showing clear resentment for the very medium it’s being made in (games)


I’ve been using Supernatural via the free trial every day since I got it, which one day missed due to a headache causes by too much running. I want to like it, I really do, there’s clearly a lot of effort put into making this a good experience, but in the end it falls short for a number of reasons

PROS: 
 - Overall great workouts. I genuinely believe Supernatural will get you sweating in a way no other VR game currently available will. Yes it’s a beat saber clone but the changes made are very beneficial to the workout experience
 - the different environments for working out in are stunning and easy to get lost in while doing the routines. Can make you feel pretty cool
 - as time has gone by, many more workouts have been added so the early issue of having not that many options is mostly gone


CONS:
 - you get a score at the end based on accuracy and power, but there’s no clear metric for power. I often reach the end of a song, feeling like I put my all into it, and see “92%”. That lack of transparency makes me inclined to not try
 - while I didn’t mind the personal trainers too much (and get the feeling you can’t mute them for song licensing reasons), half the advice they give is useless. These workouts are NOT personalized, so they just randomly say stuff like “check your posture” where they’ve guessed your posture will be bad. If you need some handholding it’s fine, but just don’t expect what they say to line up to what you do because it almost never did with me
 - there is such a lack of balance in song variety. While it’s gotten better, almost every workout with rock or punk songs are low or sometimes medium intensity. If you want a difficult workout, I hope you love EDM or pop because very few have a large volume of anything else
 - this is directly to the production team: I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOUR RIDICULOUS SOCIAL MEDIA WANNABE APP! I like the idea of syncing up for the heart monitoring software but the fact that people can follow me and like my workouts is honestly disturbing and encourages me to stop working out rather than do more.
 - while the workouts are fantastic, some of the squats and lunges are just ... what? As in they’ll have huge triangles where the whole point is a minor lunge, but it’s so big you might as well not move at all. For about half of the higher intensity workouts, I don’t know what to do with my body half the time (examples in “Bad Romance”, “War”, “Are you Gonna Be My Girl”)
 - the rejection of gamification tactics. This game encourages you to ignore getting every target and focus on general power and technique instead. No one who owns a VR headset thinks that way. The whole point of a gamified workout is to add in incentives like video games use. Beat Saber works because you fail the track if you miss too many, but also because there are high scores for tracks, encouraging you to try harder next time. By hiding your score til the end and discouraging users to try and hit all the blocks, the game shows a lack of understanding for what its users want/how they think
 - this is it. The beat saber clone is the only workout on this. I was really hoping there’d be others that work out different body parts but no, this is all there is
 - the price. I was actually considering a 3-star for this game until I got the $149/yr notification. They charge $19/month or $149/yr, and they think they can do that because they consider themselves a premium exercise experience. The truth is that supernatural is a game. A game on a market where >$40 is considered steep. Premium gyms have tons of different classes and access to equipment, justifying the steep costs. Supernatural has one game and no actual accountability. You could have bad posture the entire time and it would still tell you you did a good job at the end of the workout.

Let’s be real: supernatural is NOT a premium experience. It’s in the same category as the nintendo switch’s ringfit adventure and the wii’s balance board, both of which were around $80, $90 USD. If this was sold for a flat $80, it would be steep but I’d honestly say it’s not a terrible investment for a decent workout game. I like the idea of this. I like the trainers, I like the workouts, I even like the not-customizable encouragement given. But in the end, this will never be worth a monthly subscription and whoever estimated the value of this company’s product needs to be fired. Try out the free trial but DO NOT GIVE THIS COMPANY YOUR MONEY!


To the team behind Supernatural:
I really hope you learn from all this and fix your mistakes because I do really want you guys to succeed. You’ve got a decent product on your hands that could become great, it would be a tragedy to see it ruined because of poor marketing/management decisions. Truly, though, the big thing is this: you have made a game, not a premium experience. Rather than distancing yourselves from this, embrace it, lean into it, and you’ll see the profits come pouring in"

With so many other subscriptions based services, I do wish this didn't follow that trend. Also understand why it might be that way if the coaches and content continues to grow. Still, $19/mo feels a little steep when you think of the long run.

I've heard reports that it feels like a rip-off of beat saber, but the visuals and twist of this game is so much more satisfying, especially for someone craving a workout since I'm stuck indoors. 

Overall I'm really happy with the game after being about 1 week in. I can already feel it paying off and had to skip yesterday with my legs being so sore. The coaches encouragement is awesome, and love that the companion app adds an extra dose of connection for those that want it."
2552,sccoaire,"Jun 12, 2020 at 10:59 PM",4,Going in the right direction,"Have had my Quest for almost a month now. My first VR experience. Mostly bought it because I had seen the promo for this exercise game. I'm in my 40s, overweight, and I could barely walk after the first workout because of the squatting and... I loved it. Now that I've played a dozen times...

Beginners: How there is only one workout labelled as beginner is beyond me. I tried some others, those that are marked as automatic or dynamic to your performance. Wayyyy too difficult. Hint to developpers: if I fail the beginning of the workout within 20 seconds, I'm frustrated and quit. 

6-12-20 Update: Thanks to the developer for responding. I did try the (L) low intensity workouts and it's incredible how music can make or break motivation. I didn't care for the music selection in those workouts and lacked the desire to do well and I just ended up quitting before reaching the end. 

Triangles. I've already brought this up on 2 various occasions, once directly with the company. First, give me the option to turn it off for a workout and second, make it obvious when you successfully go through one. The visual effect when you go through seems to be some sort of backward reverberation in the same white outline but with a fading effect. In my mind, that's the effect I would expect to see when you FAIL to go through. It's just confusing and I really don't know on occasion if I fail to go through them or not. 

Lastly, there should be a demonstration on how to tackle multiple side lunges. I know how to do them, but I don't know how to switch position quickly from a right side lunge to a left  within the space of 0.5 second. I would like to see how someone else does this so that I can learn from them because I don't get it. There are not too many of those in the Beginner workout but all the others are pushing this a lot and again, just frustrating."

I had a trainer for many years but between quarantine and moving I have yet to find a new gym and a trainer so this is a great substitute!

Some app ideas (or questions) - can you unlock special locations for leveling up or attaining certain streaks?  Also maybe work with film studio for fictional locations?

2554,jamseaz,"Jun 28, 2020 at 1:03 AM",4,A good start - more features needed,"I like this app for a quick cardio blast. You really have to pay attention to your form and putting real effort into smashing the targets. I’d like to see the developer make this a bit more challenging by adding in different movement patterns that don’t rely so much on squats and lunges. For example, you could add a section where you’re on the mat on your back and sit up or push up through a target. You could add planks, where you hold through a long target, etc. So far the free trial has been good. I really like Raneir’s workouts. Will I shell out the $179 annual fee? Probably. I can tel how much work the trainers have put into developing maps, and the music is light years better than BeatSaber, which I’m sure doesn’t come cheap."
2555,Landman,"Apr 25, 2020 at 3:07 AM",1,Knock-off Beatsaber,"This feels like beatsaber, but you’re constricted into doing exactly what the game wants you to do. I’d much rather play that for $30 and have custom songs than pay $20 a month for this. I pity the person who gets suckered into paying more than that once this “founders discount” is over. The free silicon liner is cool I guess. Don’t buy this past the free trial.

UPDATE:
I decided to give supernatural a chance for a workout, so I picked the “tough” option that was 25 minutes long. Wish there were longer options but whatever. It was just one off songs playing with the coach giving random advice that didn’t actually matter to me. After 3-4 songs, the app completely crashed and the workout was ruined. I needed up just finishing in beatsaber and had much more fun actually picking my songs. My opinion of this app has not changed. If you like this style of rhythm game, just get beatsaber."
2556,smith.rusty,"May 7, 2020 at 5:58 PM",5,A fantastic work out that's actually fun,"A lifelong 'gym rat', I've generally avoided at-home workout systems.  Those that I have tried, I have lost interest after just a few workouts (everything from dvds back in the day to more recently evolved streaming workouts).  But, I actually like these workouts a lot.  And the more I do them, the better I get.  Which has made them more fun for me.    

The landscapes are breathtaking and I love the music playlists.  But even better than that are the actual workouts.  They are really challenging in terms of speed and being accurate; which gives me something to work towards.  

The workouts are full-body and are similar to a HIIT class you'd take at a gym. I end up getting my heart rate as high or sometimes higher then I would on my own in a gym or even with a personal trainer.  And the workout is over before I know it.  

As a beta user I had tried Supernatural a few times at home and then, on a whim, threw my oculus in my bag for a business trip to NYC.  It's always difficult to workout on business trips so I thought I'd give this a try to see how it would work.

I set it up the space between two beds in my small NYC hotel room and ended up using it every day I was there, without breaking or hitting anything in the room.  It turned out to be a fantastic solution.

Since then I've been working out with Supernatural 3-4 times a week and still enjoy all the new workouts and trainers. 

Genuinely a challenging workout that is actually fun."
2557,supernova,"May 21, 2020 at 11:00 PM",1,SO MUCH unused potential,"I do enjoy playing this game for the most part. It’s (relatively) fun, has decent music, the environments are good, and is a great workout. I can burn about 11-12 calories per minute playing it. There are a few things that would make the game a lot better though.

Firstly, $20 a month for a VR game is insane considering it’s just over glorified Beat Saber with a bit of Google Earth. If the price were lowered to $10 I’d most likely play longer than the trial.

Second, the coaches are a good addition for motivation and all that. But the fact that they keep talking during every song is extremely distracting, especially on some of the faster/harder songs. If you go to the settings, you can only lower their volume to half. If you do that, they’re still sometimes louder than the song, even with music volume at 100%. There should be an option to either mute them during a song or mute them entirely.

Third, the songs. The songs are ok. Not my personal favorites but still pretty good. However, we should be able to play one song at a time instead of an entire workout and be able to choose any of the ones already in the game. It would not be hard to do, just make a separate menu for individual songs.

Fourth, the patterns. The patterns feel a bit awkward at times or not having a great flow. But the biggest problems with the patterns is sometimes there are so many orbs so close together that you would have to sacrifice accuracy for power. This is very frequent and typically ends with something like 95% accuracy and only 75% power.

Fifth, we need varying difficulty. I don’t mean intensity, I mean technical difficulty (triangles and orbs) we should be able to make the game easier from that standpoint.

Sixth, We should be able to make custom levels. I know that this would be very hard to pull off, maybe even impossible, but if we could it might just make the game worth it.

Seventh, a few quality of life improvements we should have are an option to disable 360 or have a small room mode, and we should be able to change the colors.

Thanks for reading. In conclusion, go play Beat Saber. It’s much cheaper, has more features and everything this game has if you mod it."
2558,Ydnew,"May 5, 2020 at 7:28 PM",5,just what i'd hoped it would be,"I was looking forward to this and it was exactly as advertised. Beautiful, immersive settings (curious to see if they'll be adding any ""fantasy worlds"" to it for variation), fun and current music, upbeat and friendly trainers. Hitting the targets were calibrated perfectly. In terms of the trainers, I fall into the camp of liking hearing them talking and doling out relevant bits of advice along the way (lower your shoulders, lighter on your feet, like that). I imagine after a while if you have favorite workouts that you want to return to, you'd want the option to turn the trainer companion off. Tip--although you are turning 360, the ends of the long ""bats"" that you're swinging seem to be what's triggering the guardian to pop up, not because you're actually close to it (you're only turning in a stationary circle). I will experiment with making the guardian larger than i normally would so that it doesn't pop up every time I swing, which broke the immersion a bit. Just have to remember to bring it back in before a different game! I love the apple watch/phone sync and seeing my heart rate on the screen that pops up in between workouts, everything about the app pairing process was easy and worked. Price-wise, I think the value in a subscription for you will depend on whether you're a gym person or not, and how consistent you want to be with your workouts. Not a gym person here, so i'm excited to try challenging myself to keep up with the daily workouts and I hope this concept takes off.

2559,RumHam,"May 1, 2020 at 11:59 PM",5,Amazing workout game,I have all most of the workout games on here and none have been as fun as supernatural . Love the backdrops and the excellent coaching and interactions with the player . Yes it has a subscription model but you really have to think about what this is . They are promising regular workout updates plus catering to a very niche market so I’d imagine that means a higher cost needed per player to maintain. I’m gonna try this trail out and get an idea of what kind of updates they deliver to see if the sub is worth keeping.                     Note on the gameplay: would love some feedback from the ones that have you follow the tail with your controller . I really can’t tell if I am following it as there is no visual or controller feedback to confirm it . This caused me to look at my hand time to time and get me distracted .
2560,AJ,"May 29, 2020 at 8:25 AM",2,Pretty sorry excuse for an exercise tool,"Let's ignore for a second that VR is not a good tool for exercise in general.

There are literally 2 things this app has you do: swing your arms and squat (or lunge). That doesn't do much of anything for your core.

My real problem is that it doesn't show you duration or calories burned. I don't care about my accuracy or score or ""power"" rating. I want to know how long I worked out and how much I burned."

People are honestly being way too critical and shortsighted for a wonderful feature that is just getting started. This workout game has wonderful graphics, features a great workout concept where your are working along choreographed moves with certified coaches, and allows for paired tracking of heart rate. All in all, a great buy for someone who wants to get into shape with a changing daily routine of workouts. And yes, it’s a subscription. Less than what most gyms will charge you, and you get something new from it every day."

2563,Sparkzzly,"Apr 24, 2020 at 10:25 AM",1,Way too costly,"This is just a copy of other music type games already available. Only difference is the environment and some trainer talking over the music that totally throws you out of the song and is just annoying. There is no reason this needs to be such a costly monthly subscription for something that already exists. I can do the exact same workout in beat saber or synth rider so this is not anything new. $20 each month...absolutely not. If it was $20 a year, maybe but still not convinced. The box vr games is marketed as a workout game having choreographed exercise routines and they add new routines from time to time. That game is only a one time payment of $30"
2564,dominhyde,"Apr 24, 2020 at 10:04 PM",1,What were you thinking?,"Every other 1 star review has said it all already. I understand the 20$ a month price goes towards paying licenses for the songs, the trainers and content creators. 

But let's be honest, who cares you have licensed music? Do you think everybody likes or wants to exercise to mainstream radio music? Also, do you think a virtual trainer adds anything valuable to your service? 

Fitness lovers are already a very low percentage of the overall VR users, and I think that 90% of such lovers would prefer to pay 20$/mo for a subscription to a real gym and not for a game. 

Not only, this game is a shameless clone of Beat Saber so I wouldn't be surprised if they sued you at some point.

I don't know what type of market research you have done before starting developing this idea, I am under the impression you haven't done any because the business model behind this product is just one big failure. What were you thinking?"

I love the trainer Leanne, I find myself smiling goofily back at her and remind myself how silly I must look. At first, I was bummed cuz I only saw one beginner workout. But then I noticed that for many workouts the difficulty level adjusts as you use it. And in a few workouts I can go beyond the beginner level. Boning up on beat saber probably helped my coordination with its campaign mode. Wish there was a similar training program that helps you intuitively get better quicker in this workout program. I also wish different kinds of workout-meditation, kickboxing, yoga were offered here-that would make it a fantastic fitness subscription. Maybe they’ll get there.definitely enjoy getting my heart rate up and looking like an idiot in my backyard on cloudy days playing this😉"
2567,Meta Sucks,"Jun 1, 2020 at 8:15 AM",2,Monthly price too expensive.,Seemed like a decent app but when I found out about the $20 a month subscription fee I just deleted it. I didn't even bother with the free month when I knew I was never going to pay the ridiculous cost. What an outrageous price tag. My gym membership doesn't even cost that. If you're looking for a good workout app that you only have to pay for once just stick with Beat Saber. It is every bit as good an aerobic workout. Don't bother with this.
2568,ShakedownVictim,"Jun 2, 2020 at 5:15 AM",1,A lot of potential,"EDIT: Based on the developer response, I will NOT be renewing after my 30 day trial period and updated my rating. Looks like the coaches are here to stay to annoy your workout and insult your intelligence ( I don't need to be reminded to breathe). Modded beatsaber (bsaber.com) and Thrill of the Fight continue to be the best workout combo for VR.
---

I'm currently on the 30 day trial deciding whether or not I will pay for this service.

I really enjoy the intensity of the workouts as well as the music selection. It's not as good of a workout as Thrill of the Fight but it's definitely better than beatsaber in that aspect.

I do have some issues though:

The trainers are useless outside of the initial tutorial. They are practically DJ's that will randomly annoy you throughout the workouts. There is no option to turn off their audio, just an option to reduce their volume by 50%. I don't need them to introduce every song and I don't need their encouragement during the workout. I want to work out and enjoy the music, not hear their voice. It's so annoying that it's almost a deal breaker for me.

The music volume seems capped.. especially compared to beatsaber. I play with headphones and it sounds like the song is playing at half volume with everything maxed out. This is probably to prevent the music from drowning out of the voice of the trainer.. which brings us back to the first point. Please give us an option to get rid of them.

I really do enjoy the full body workout I get from this game, but the low music volume and the trainers may keep me from renewing."
2569,matthewmoynihan32,"Apr 27, 2020 at 12:24 AM",5,,"I liked this workout VR game.  I like the integration with your Apple Watch which tracks your heart rate and your power statistics afterwards.   I also enjoyed the 360 range of motion with the game.  I played this game for three days and took on average three classes a day.  My heart averages around 134 to 136 beats per minute during a class. It is a beautifully designed game that tailored to your custom height and range.   

The music is great hopefully,  they will incorporate different types of music into the classes like Hard Rock or even Heavy Metal like Metallica.  

I understand people concerns about the $20.00 a month subscription, but if you play it everyday or even every other day it not that expensive.   It’s like a gym membership. If you use it everyday or at least three days a week well worth it otherwise it’s expensive and not worth cost."

However the ability for this app to auto adjust to your ability is just not there.  The objects flying around as the session ramps up is just dizzying.  Also the balance between upper and lower body just did not seem to be there.  And yes after trying to justify in multiple ways the monthly subscription just does not have a chance against the current market and choices in the quest already.  Hope its not over for these guys, its a good start but imo a failed execution on play and  price."

I can do this in the morning and 20 minutes flies by like nothing.   In the evening I workout to Synth Riders.  I would pay the $19 a month in a heartbeat but with one big ask!!! Music needs to be varied more.  I found myself really getting the best workout with Retrofit......because I know the music....it doesn't stop me from doing the other workouts and I find myself liking songs I didn't know existed but with that price --- you need to appeal to more folks.  It also wouldn't hurt that with Synth Riders each Sunday they do an event with others lead by one person.  So you get the feeling of being in a class but not driving there, have to park, then drive sweaty home.  Plus you are not comparing yourself to others.  It it just good comraderie.  I never write reviews, the only reason I am here is because I want to see this startup make it.

UPDATE:  I pulled the trigger and went for the yearly, after I noticed they have added more Retro play lists.  I love the workouts.  A simple 20 minutes in the morning and I am on my to work with no muss or fuss of gyms or missing formal class workouts.  I do think classifications of more beginner or intermediate type workouts would be good add.  Sometimes I feel like I am just flailing around but...I am moving and doing more than I would otherwise.  20 minute workouts just fly by...it is pretty amazing.  More Retro and more Rainier!!!"
2575,CaptainKW,"Apr 30, 2020 at 7:24 AM",5,Bad Romance kicked my as*,"I have played a lot of Beat Saber maps and VR archery workout games, but Supernatural really kicked my as*.  That featured workout today ""Dark Forces"" got dark real quick and I haven't feel this tired since the quarantine began, yet can't stop feeling awesome about the bad romance I just had (yah they actually licensed the full Lady Gaga song).  The hits were on beat and on point and I feel like a hip-hop dancer.  I took hip-hop classes when I was younger and living in Austin, TX and totally sucked at it.  But today I kicked as*.  Incredible workout."
2576,RealitySmith,"Apr 30, 2020 at 12:35 AM",5,"A great workout, and only getting better","I wanted to wait a few days to write my review, since I was a bit skeptical of Supernatural at first. I come from playing tons of Beat Saber at Expert+ level, and BoxVR/Pistol Whip for other exercise. I wasn’t too optimistic for this app after seeing that it would be a subscription service, but I wanted to try it anyway.

Let me start this review by saying that any other review that says the subscription price is ridiculous is completely ungrounded right now, because everyone that owns this experience is still on the 30 day free trial, so nobody has spent a penny. Despite that, we continue to get new workouts *every single day* and already several updates. There’s no reason to complain about the price yet when it’s free and they haven’t even been given a chance to deserve that subscription money.

Honestly, Supernatural is an amazing workout. I spent almost every day playing an hour of Beat Saber each morning, but was exhausted after only 30 minutes of Supernatural. The workouts are intense and dynamic to adapt to your skill, and the squats are brutal and make me work in ways that Best Saber never did. The emphasis in power and broad slashes with the bats are nice too, it works more of my arms and shoulders. Beat Saber tends to be more about wrist movement than large arm swings.

I think that Supernatural is also doing enough right now to differentiate it from experiences like Beat Saber. Sure, there are some similar core mechanics, but the scoring is completely different (power per hit is far more important), the dynamic difficulty is awesome, squats and lunges during workouts are unique, and the overall emphasis on fitness sets it apart.

Speaking of the emphasis on fitness, this is very clearly a fitness app, compared to beat saber which is very clearly a rhythm game with the benefit of fitness. Supernatural has coaches (and if you don’t like them, you can just turn their volume off) for every single workout, that constantly remind you of proper form and what to focus on. Scoring is based on workout quality, and the heart-rate tracking and post-workout stats are absolutely amazing. Not to mention the custom app ecosystem and competitive weekly leaderboards. 

Admittedly, this game still has a few bugs and issues, but they’re being addressed quickly. I sent an email with tons of feedback to the support team and received a fast reply addressing most of it, so it’s clear the team is already committed to constantly improving the app. And honestly, I’m willing to forgive a slightly unstable launch that gets better over time, because Supernatural is exactly the workout I was looking for while being stuck at home.

Again, there’s no reason to complain about the price right now since there’s a 30 day free trial, but I’ve already been impressed with the new and differentiated workouts each day. As much as I would love to have features like the ability to play individual songs and per-song leaderboards, I realize that I only want that because I’m so used to Beat Saber, and I think that Supernatural is really going all-in on being an exercise experience, which may just be exactly the right move."
2577,Loudfire,"Apr 29, 2020 at 7:22 PM",5,Sweating so hard! Loving the music,Big fan of oh shape and beat saber. This game Takes the Cake! I love all the coaches and the input they give as you move your body. It is spot-on. The music is great. Been a while since I've been pumping like this! Word of advice when you set up your workout station use a small yoga mat and line it up with the yoga mat on the ground in the workout. It will keep you tactically focused on the safe Zone area! Keeping this as a subscription definitely worth the $20 a month. I got a better workout than I do at my gym and I didn't have to wait or fight for equipment to do so!
2578,sleeprl,"Apr 30, 2020 at 5:15 AM",5,Loving the workout!,"I'm enjoying the daily workouts! It's fun and gives me something to look forward to everyday to de-stress. I love the environments that the workouts are set in to remind me of some of my travels. My heart rate is usually within 150-170 bpm each workout.

The difficulty setting sometimes was a bit off and it felt like I was flailing a bit, but I think they've since fixed the algorithm. It was also hard to get used to the black and white color balls and to see the direction 'arrows' to hit.

I enjoy playing to songs I recognize which help me get immersed into the game and I do like the trainer overlay, but I would occasionally like to turn this off.

The biggest con for me like everyone else is the subscription price; $19 is a bit steep. I'd be happy to pay $10—15 per month. Hopefully the price comes down a bit before the trial is over. I'd like to see this game succeed!

Overall, I'd give the game a 3.5 due to the minor issues and cost but rounding up to a 5 since I think some others have rated this a bit unfairly."
2579,NatasX,"Apr 29, 2020 at 9:49 PM",5,Excellent Workout App!!!,"I just finished my 3rd workout and I am really energized to continue. What I like the most is that this workout app actually feels like it has a soul. Between the new classes, beautiful scenery, and relevant music. It just feels like it is really being curated. Often the problem I have had with this kind of app is the constant repetition feels empty at a certain point. Which just kills my motivation.

I mention the scenery because one thing I hate about gyms is staring at that same wall all the time. So far I haven't had the same scenes come up to often. It's really exciting to see where you are going next. I've even had a fictional sci-fi theme come up.

Of course, I will reevaluate when the trial ends, but so far I see myself keep going with the subscription and see where this thing grows. Probably even going to buy a heart rate monitor to pair.

My only caution is based on the reviews I think some people were expecting more of a game than a workout app. This app is about working out first and foremost to help you achieve your fitness goals. If you're looking for a typical rhythm game this probably isn't for you. If you're looking for a workout. You've come to the right place.

If you have any doubts I do believe the tutorial is free without signing for an account or anything. That will definitely give you a good flavor for how the workouts in the app look and feel."
2580,liangyuan,"Apr 26, 2020 at 5:53 PM",5,great workout game,"a very good alternative to beat saber. good graphics background and tracking generally holds up. but the coaches audio can get distracting and there is no option to off it completely. 

the hit notes appear often at blind spots of oculus quest (directly below and above headset) causing tracking to be lost quite frequently. coupled with squats and trying to hit notes in the blindspots excacerbate the issue. (i play on expert+ in beatsaber and rarely loses tracking but i feel like the controllers lose tracking a whole lot more in supernatural even though the speed and number of notes are much lower compared to beatsaber) 

i love how the fitness coaches conduct warm up and cooldowns. However, please provide an option to switch off their audio during gameplay. pre-recorded messages of them going ""keep going!"" ""i love this song!"" ""feel the burn!"" and etc really breaks the rythme of the song and admiring the beautiful background."
2581,Joe,"Jun 10, 2020 at 7:03 PM",2,Good. Needs Improvement.,"I am not in the best shape to start with, but not a complete sloth either.  

I did the demo and it felt like a great workout.  So I signed up for the free trial.  I did it the workouts the first couple days - and they kicked my butt.   That's the good.  The bad is the workouts were frustratingly difficult.  I was missing 50% of the swings and forget about squatting through all the triangles.

They need to make the workouts adaptive.  If you are not keeping up, send fewer things to swing at and fewer triangles.   If you are keeping up, send more!

The music selection was not anything I ever heard before (Gen X'er - not that much into music), so that was  not as enjoyable as it could be.

If were $25 and I owned the game, I would not be disappointed.  The subscription model felt a like a health club membership I never used.   I canceled on the last day of the trial because I had not come back to it for a couple weeks.

I *have* become addicted to BeatSaber and play that almost every day.  Not exactly the same, but I started out on Easy, and progressed on some of the songs to Normal, to Advanced and when I am done with a song, my heartrate is definitely elevated."
2582,daniellessj,"Jun 25, 2020 at 7:51 AM",4,Love it but could be better,"I've completed my free 30-day trial and decided to go with a monthly membership. I would like to have an annual membership, but I am not sure if I could continuously play it for a whole year.  During the past 30 days, I almost played it every day. This app designed workouts in a smart way. Everyday we have different workouts so that we will not get bored day after day. In addition, for each workout, it also includes warm-up and cool down. The most attractive part of this app to me is that we could travel to beautiful scenery while doing excises. I love this app but have some suggestions: 

1. could we add more beautiful places of the world to the app? I am a little bit tired of seeing the same places day after day and would like to discover some new places. 

2. So far, almost all the workouts are less than 30 mins. Could we have some workouts for advanced level users? I plan to use this as a substitute for my gym and hope I could have a full workout with this app. Thanks!"

Pros:
+Great scenery
+Engaging workout
+The app is cool and I appreciate that it connects with the Apple Watch
Cons:
- Expensive... there are many other quest games that I use to get my daily workout in, all of them have a one time fee. I wouldnt mind paying like $5 a month, or even some nice annual subscription price, but $20/month is a bit much...
- I wish that there was some in-game score tracking system. It would be nice to see how well I am hitting the orbs during gameplay.
- No feedback from the ""tails"". Having some sort of vibration system to let you know that you are following the tails properly would be cool, kind of like Synthriders does.
- Sometimes, when I hit the orbs, it doesnt register that they've been hit, and I swear I'm hitting them lol. 

Thanks for taking the time to listen to my feedback! I will continue playing the free-trial period and update my review if necessary."
2584,Steven,"Apr 29, 2020 at 5:44 AM",5,Game changer with a few areas to improve,"I've been playing Supernatural for about a week now. Overall, I'm extremely impressed ... and slightly addicted. The landscapes are beautiful, although a bit grainy (as to be expected for real life images in VR). The gameplay is excellent and the challenging mix of squats and every-which-way saber chops makes it so enjoyable that time flys by. Although some other folks have complained about the trainer guidance, I personally enjoy it, as it can serve as a much needed boost in motivation or a simple reminder to breath and pay attention to your posture. I do have a few suggestions: 

1) More and varied music: I feel like the creators tried too hard to incorporate commercial pop music at the expense of greater variety. I'd rather listen to generic or lesser known electronic tracks than hear the same song over and over again. 
2) Longer workouts: My ideal workout at this intensity would last around 40 minutes. Obviously you can do two back-to-back workouts, but then you have to sit through the intro and cool down sessions (and your HR drops)
3) Better support for HR monitors: I have a Garmin watch that I tried to pair with the Android app with no luck. So I ended up purchasing the Polar HR monitor Supernatural sells on it's website. Still no luck. I contacted support and their response was ""well, you can track your HR on the Polar Android app."" So $80 bucks down the drain!

Overall, I'm still really enjoying the game and look forward to new content coming down the pipeline. Yes, $20 a month is a pretty penny, but if they add more music (and fast), I'll have no problem renewing that subscription!"
2585,Max,"Apr 29, 2020 at 3:51 AM",5,A great fitness app,"Provides a great workout, much better than Beat Saber Expert+. The experience is really well tailored to get you a good workout and I find myself getting really pumped up playing this.

I consider this a workout app first and game second which is why I understand some of the design decisions. For instance, I actually like the trainer, but hope their commentary is tailored specifically to your performance in the future.

At $19/month, you get really good maps and songs which may not be my favorites, but are very good for workout songs so I am pretty content with that.
I really think the subscription model is justified if they keep a good variety of licensed music, as it really is important to have a good amount of variety to get me into the workout.

Can be improved, but I definitely think it is in a very good state for a new release. Will likely be improved in the future to fuel subscriptions."
2586,AaronMJones2,"Apr 29, 2020 at 12:36 AM",5,This might be worth the cost?,"This was a lot of fun!! I just finished both of the Tutorial and Beginners workouts.  I’m definitely feeling the workout and I’m curious to see how I feel tomorrow.  The workout focuses on multiple muscle groups and is a real workout! The music is great and I like how the songs change throughout the workout... 

I’ve been playing around with it a bit, but I haven’t found a way for other family members to use it without messing up my progress.  Maybe each family member needs their own Companion App on their phone?  Hopefully, we don’t need to pay $20 per month for each family member..  

I think the person leading the workouts said something about being live on the workouts after the stay at home orders are lifted??    

I plan on doing this daily for the next 30 days and I can’t wait to see the results!!!  If this works out the way I plan and the family is able to use the app, then the $20 monthly cost is well worth it!  Maybe you all could add an annual discount offer at the end of 30days?"

Also would be lovely to have the option to interact live. Sign up for a class or something. Is there a way to add the fitness coach to the screen while we are working out? If not this would be a great addition. This would challenge a person more to complete the workouts."
2590,PopsNurgle,"May 19, 2020 at 11:07 PM",4,Surprised!,"After reading the reviews I expected to hate this app. But I didn’t. It’s actually really well done. I enjoyed the music, the trainers and the environments (which are stunning). I’m not sure if it’s the best workout but I was sweating hard after my first day (40 minutes) and I’m a very active person (or was before the plague).

I had a few concerns similar to those that I read in reviews:

1. The monthly fee. Just like everyone else, I’m not sold on this. I know this is the trend with at home workout services, but I didn’t buy into those and it would be a tough to sell me on this. I’d be a lot more comfortable with an up front fee. This is really the only thing keeping me from a 5 star review.

2. The trainers talking over the entire workout. I will tell you that it didn’t bother me the way that this bothered others. I will also tell you that I picked up ring fit adventure on release day and have done it every other day for 6 months. After listening to that annoying character for so long, these trainers were a breath of fresh air. 

I did see that there was now an option to turn trainer volume all the way down now. I don’t know if that was a recent update but it’s there if the trainers really are a problem.

3. I was concerned about using my quest as a workout tool (I’m sweaty), but I just got an email from supernatural letting me know that they are sending a complimentary sweat guard for my headset. That is really freaking cool.

I’m planning on giving this 30 days. I don’t think I will keep it up with the monthly fee, but I will give it an honest shot.

UPDATE:

I kept my word and gave this an honest shot and, honestly, really enjoyed it. I’m not changing my starred review because I do feel the app to be a solid 4. It works great, it’s got good music, the scenery is still stunning and I genuinely enjoyed most of the trainers. Bonus points for the Supernatural team sending me a free face guard for my oculus within a few days. That was super cool and super impressive. 

The cons are mostly minor. Sometimes I feel like the target placements don’t make sense and break the immersion. Or I just suck. Either way, extremely minor point.

The elephant in the room is obviously still the price. The developers are running a special for a deep discount right now and I was planning on picking it up. However, I’ve also just found out that my position was terminated due to the plague. So now I can’t. 

I genuinely like this app and recommend to anyone interested to give it a fair shot. You may really like what you find. I’m planning on jumping back in once I find a new job."
2591,emptyh,"Jun 4, 2020 at 7:43 PM",3,No flow,"Price aside, the app lacks the sense of flow you get in box vr.   Every 3-4 minutes (depending on song length) the screen blacks out, the new location loads, and the trainer gives some cheesy DJ intro about how awesome they think this next song is.  The end result is a good 30 seconds of down time every 3-4 minutes which leads to this being more like a game than a workout.  I also think the tracking is less accurate than box vr.  The problem might be the targets.  BoxVR has glowing bright targets against a dark background.  This app has white and black targets against varied backgrounds sometime white (like ice) sometime dark grey (like a stormy sky) so it is harder to pick them up.  They also spawn a lot closer than box vr, so I feel like I am just swatting them away vs seeing an incoming combo and mentally preparing to focus on my moves.  End result is a frustrating experience and not as good a workout as I feel I could have.  Potential, but needs some overhauling."
2592,Mahk,"May 25, 2020 at 12:00 PM",2,"Could be good, but not as it is now","This app DESPERATELY needs a ""beginner"" and ""intermediate"" level. It has some great upsides; like beautiful scenery and life-like in-game trainers, but it's difficulty to the beginning user is way too hard. 
      I will use two well-known apps to explain and compare: In BoxVR the difficulty lies in the physical effort to hit the targets with good form while in BeatSaber the difficulty lies in the speed, dexterity, and pattern memorization/anticipation needed to hit the targets. Supernatural combines both of these concepts BUT does so at the PRO level right from the start. Imagine picking up BeatSaber for the first time and playing five, back-to-back songs you've never heard before at ""Expert+ 360"" while trying to put serious force behind each swing. That is what Supernatural is. Complexity and pattern memorization detract from, not add-to, exercise. I highly suggest they allow users to play one song at a time, a-la BeatSaber, so they may gain confidence and gradually move up to multi-song sessions. 
     Music is subjective and some may like what the app offers. If the $20.00 per MONTH price is due to music-royalties I say skip them and use generic tracks. Or make the main-app a one-time purchase and sell artist-specific bonus packs like BeatSaber does. $20.00 per month is far too much for music I don't care about. 
     Finally, and this is again personal preference, I find it much more satisfying to punch a target with speed and force in BoxVR than I do hitting balloons with bats in Supernatural. I find the former to be more primal and satisfying, but that may be just me. Conversely BoxVR has no excuse for not upping their background visuals to match the great ones in Supernatural.
    In short the devs need to flatten the steep learning curve and drastically change the pay-structure if they want to appeal to the masses instead of a small, select group. Best of luck to them. Personally I won't be paying $20.00 a month for this."

2594,Moibuspm,"Apr 23, 2020 at 11:33 PM",2,LISTEN UP DEVELOPER,Are you wondering why you are getting such horrible review scores? Its because $20 a month is ridiculous!!! Thats $240 a year for 1 game! Ive never given such a bad review score before in 40 years of playing games but Im tired of game developers putting all these transactions and fees into games. I'll gladly pay $40 for your game  but never will I...and the looks of what I see people saying on the internet... pay outrageous fees for any game. Its a shame because the game itself is high quality. Again Id buy your game outright for $40 and give you 5 stars but with a dam $20 a month price???? No way.
2595,elfhug,"May 30, 2020 at 11:46 AM",3,"Good, but price not justifiable","I've enjoyed the workouts but the subscription model adopted only really caters for someone who is prepared to fully commit on a daily basis  And even then, in order to justify the price tag, it would need to be significantly better than anything else out in the market. And well....it just isn't.  The developer should therefore consider an additional option for the casual, more occasional user. 
A purchase price of $30 with perhaps 10 workouts and the option to purchase additional workout packs would significantly extend the user base and bring the product within the realms of mass acceptability. I'm convinced that ultimately this dual pricing approach wil generate more revenue than alienating all those who are not able/prepared to pay either $149 up front annually or $,20 monthly , though who would probably wish to continue with Supernatural. And to be pragmatic, over time , we really don't need a NEW workout every day. I'm pretty sure that if the developer were to check the corporate play metrics it would reveal that even at this formative stage, most folks tend to gravitate towards their favourite workouts anyway! 
So an alternative pricing option please for those who would like to use a few times a week as a component of a fitness regime and not it's main focus.
Thanks for listening"
2596,questin,"May 29, 2020 at 7:21 AM",4,"Really good, with potential","Update: a week and a half in and I'm adding a star. The sweat cover came and it's much better than the one I had!  

Also, I'm not sure if the algorithm caught up or what, but the maps are more doable now and still challenge me. The triangles are still tricky and I can't tell if I ""made"" it or not. Could continue to work on map flow and the triangle piece, but I'm overall happy with this game and would continue it after the trial period. Thanks!

...
This review doesn't take into account the cost, which has been covered ad nauseum by others. Frankly, I actually don't mind the cost so long as there's value.  The sweat liner is a great touch. The experience is great too. I am loving the scenery and the coaches. The gameplay is what I think could use the most improvement: (1) make the orbs stand out a little more (different color) because sometimes i have a hard time seeing them on certain backgrounds. (2) flow can be improved, there are some awkward movements (3) can you make the different triangles shapes more distinct? (Again, different colors, for different shapes?) I find it hard to tell them apart at the speeds they are going. Also how low do you need to go to make it through the triangle? (4) I find the ""reward"" of  making it through the triangle or hitting an orb to be lackluster. Can you make some sort of more emphasized feedback?  Today was my first day playing and I went into this completely willing to pay, but I just didn't have a ton of FUN after the awe of the scenery quickly wore off. I think with these very minor tweaks I would look forward to more sessions."

2602,Slick,"Apr 26, 2020 at 9:48 PM",1,Will never be worth 20 bucks a month.,"Start with the pros.
Nice presentation. Clean UI, stable framerate, good graphics for a quest game. The song selection could be worse, I guess. Connecting to a smart watch is a must for a fitness app, nice that functionality is there. Also a plus that there is a companion app.

Now the cons.
Hit detection is not great. Anyone with beatsaber experience will tell you that. I know song preference is subjective, but...meh. only the apple watch is supported. I assume support for other watches will be added later, but currently that doesn't help the majority of smart watch or heart rate monitor users. The fact that it always has to be online is also a big no no. In the event your connection gets interrupted, you have lost all progress. I had to repeat the last song of my workout 3 times before it finally stopped saying there was a connection error.

 I know they claim the reason they need to ask 20 bucks a month is because of the trainers and licensed music, but let's be honest, the vast majority of users will want to turn the trainers off, which there currently is no option for. Trainers are meant to demonstrate and correct form, the latter of which they do not do since it is not live. No one wants to hear some random person talk about how much they like the song that is playing. Pre-recorded small talk is incredibly stupid. If the reason for a subscription is something that most people will want to turn off, your model won't work. And just for comparison, this costs more than Netflix, Amazon prime, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon music, Xbox game pass ultimate, an annual pass to universal studios, a membership to planet fitness, the list goes on and on. If they think this provides even remotely the same value or content of any of those, they are out of their minds. The value is just not there, and never will be. On top of that, the nature of the service means if and when they have to shut down...that's it, it's just gone. No way to continue using it. All that money spent, just to not have access to it anymore.

No thanks.

Update: after using it for a few days I've run into several game breaking issues. While in the middle of a song, the connection issue overlay came up blocking the vast majority of the screen, while the track kept going, completely blocking my view of the blocks, until it decided to reconnect to the servers. This is completely unnecessary, and ruins the entire workout. There is also an issue with using passthrough, as twice when I stopped between songs to take a sip of water, while on the track review screen, it made me completely play the song over again. Until these issues are fixed, I wouldn't bother wasting your 30 day trial."
2603,AndrewTek,"Apr 26, 2020 at 8:05 PM",2,"Great idea, Offensive pricing scheme","This fitness app has a lot of potential. It takes good ideas from games like Beat Saber and Pistol Whip ... and focuses on fitness. The idea of regular influxes of new music, digital coaches and uninterrupted exercise seems great.

Big problem though. They want to charge $20 every month for this.

I have been reading the justifications in various forums. They fall flat. This pricing is offensive.

The coaches are not live with you. They are digital assets. Recorded beautifully, but still assets. They have algorithms that I expect they will update over time to keep their users motivated. But this is expected for an app these days.

Nintendo's Ring Fit Adventute has more fitness activites with actual resistance AND includes coaching AND you only have to pay once. 

If not for the pricing, this app would be a solid 3 or 4 stars. With typical app updates I could see it eventually being 4 or 5 stars. But as it is today, l will keep using other apps for my fitness goals.

UPDATE
----

Okay, so I have continued using this app to see how well it works. I really love using VR for exercise, so if this App works and the price comes into alignment with reality I could see it helping people.

But they need to fix a few problems:

1. This is not Beat Saber. It is a fitness app. The levels should be designed to keep you moving, but not in a way that has you missing blocks because the patterns get tricky. More repetition of shorter patterns would be better for this. 

2. This app supports my heart rate monitor (Polar H10) for about 5 minutes. Then it just reports the last number it got. The pairing with the Polar H10 was troublesome as well. If I have to use the companion app to restart monitoring every 5 minutes, that's not a good experience.

3. The collision detection is spotty. I frequently hit the target hard, but it doesn't register the hit. I literally swing through it. I play Beat Saber and get perfect songs, so I think there might be a bug here.

4. The signup process is painful! I did the intro before signing up. Then I signed up and had to so the intro again. Then, on the last step of the intro, the app couldn't load the next video and I had to restart. So, I got to do the intro again. This needs to be skippable. As a matter of fact, all talking and warmup/cooldown sessions should be skippable. 

The price is still a no-go for me, but I will continue to give this app a chance during their free trial. Hopefully at the end of the trial, they will have fixed some bugs and have a more compelling price."
2604,Adam,"Apr 27, 2020 at 1:40 AM",3,Needs work,"Update:
Things seem to have stabilized and I can now make it through a workout on my first try. 

My biggest issue is the ""dynamic difficulty"". I'm not sure how it works, but the effective difficulty is too high for a fitness app in my opinion. It feels like playing beat saber one level higher than I'm comfortable, and hitting orbs seems to be less forgiving with accuracy than a game like beat saber. This isn't what I want from a fitness app. I want to be able to focus on form and power, but instead I'm flailing desperately trying to keep up with the insane barrage of orbs. I regularly have to completely stop myself and reset in the middle of a song to try and get back in sync, it completely kills my workout. BoxVR does this very well by comparison, it's very physically challenging but rarely complex enough that I miss more than the occasional target. 

In contrast with other reviews, I like the trainers (as a fitness experience it makes sense). However the music seemed too quiet when the trainer wasn't speaking. Music and scenery were great in general.

Given the high recurring costs and issues mentioned above, I'll most likely stick with BoxVR for my VR workout until they refine this experience more. I hope they do!

Original:
Seems like they're having some major launch issues. I wasn't able to make it through the tutorial even after multiple hard resets. The trainers stutter and the experience freezes constantly. At one point I lost tracking one a controller completely. Another time the game started repeatedly launching a training video over and over in quick succession. Don't waste your time until they manage to stabilize their software. At least there wasn't an upfront cost..."

Most of my workouts happen in the gym, whether it be at my college or when I'm in my hometown for the holidays. Supernatural has given me a way to enjoy being at home while also achieving my goals of growing stronger and leaner. While it does have its hiccups here and here (it's a VR app, and a brand-new one at that, at the end of the day), it's been one of my greatest sources of entertainment in this quarantine. Big thanks to the Supernatural team for making home workouts great again :)"

It's not intended for beginners or people who get frustrated easily. Requires a lot of movement and regular use. I use it 3-4x week and can see difference in how much faster and more efficiently complete the exercises. I was doing game inside my house but had sweat on all the walls. You really sweat in this game. Moved to my garage which is much better. More space helps. I'd give it 5 stars if it was $10/month. But till I go back to my CorePower I'm sticking with Supernatural.

So maybe just consider adding maybe 4-6 free songs for each intensity.
2612,Tejas Shroff,"May 27, 2020 at 1:43 AM",3,Nails The Workout But Not The Fun,"First off, I really do appreciate the hard work this team has put in Supernatural, from the environments to maps.

I understand that Supernatural is not a game, and its promise lies in its ability to provide a workout where you don't feel like you are ""working out"". During my 30-day trail period, I definitely felt the intensity of the workout, and I did see some results physically, but it still felt like a workout to me. 

Other games like Thrill Of The Fight and Beat Saber nail the fun, and a decent workout is an added benefit. Those apps also have a one-time purchase payment method.

The argument that ""there are only so many ways to provide a rhythm experience"" feels cheap, and for $19 a month I expect something that other apps don't provide. I agree that it's difficult to innovate, but this app is sort of a Beat Saber clone, and doesn't really do anything extraordinary with the mechanics.

I do appreciate the focus on fitness, especially the different trainers, but as a result the app feels even more like a workout and doesn't provide enough fun.

TL;DR: The price justifies the team backing it, but the product doesn't fulfill its promise of a fun workout."
2613,GrumpyPants,"Apr 24, 2020 at 11:01 PM",1,Wanted to love it,"After install on both quest and mobile, took over twenty minutes to get into the initial workout. Never could get my polar HR monitor to be recognized. Possible conflict with YUR made YUR completely stop functioning.

But okay it's new and maybe the install process is in bed of help, let's get in a workout and see if it's good. Meh. Very short songs, extremely long pauses between them (heart rate never gets to a sustained good target) and after third song, it locked up on the loading screen and required a restart.

During the workout, instructor was obnoxious and could NOT shut up for more than 2 seconds. Do people like that?

I'm disappointed that internet is required at all times and you can't seem to preload the songs for a lesson. At the very least the program should be caching the next song while your in the current song, not wait until after.

I was set up to accept the idea of a $20/mo fee since I'm not paying a gym right now but not with this shameful execution.

The positive? Nice looking natural environments for a toned down bit of beat saber play. That's it, that's what you get. Definitely canceling. Shame."
2614,Andrew Ong,"May 26, 2020 at 4:23 PM",3,Needs drastic adjustments,"I have a Rift S. I bought a Quest JUST for this game. 
I played five workouts total. 

Like: 
* no fun-killing ""Level failed"" like in Beat Saber 
* Less focus on pointless high scores and combos, unlike Beat Saber where score and combo are the only thing the interface shows. 
* new first-party content every day,
* Beat maps have variety unlike the third party Beat Saber maps that tend to be repetitive 
* actual backgrounds instead of a Beat Saber neon temple. And some surreal backgrounds. 
* dynamic difficulty adjustment (on some levels —actually the devs said it’s on all the levels) 
* has squats like Beat Saber Fitbeat level. There are a little too many of them.   
* The notes come from really far away and don't spawn right in front of you like half of Beat Saber third-party maps 
* Comparison only to myself, not the top 10 players in the world. 
*  
Neutral: 
* Lack of wrist movement. Intuitive patterns. I hit 96% of the Supernatural targets. In Beat Saber I hit only 50% on most Expert+. On the hard Beat Saber maps, I only hit 21%. I actually like the wrist movement when its clear how to move my wrists and I still have to move my arms. Not when I'm flustered and confused. Not when I can get away with ONLY wrists.  Supernatural should have wrist AND arm movement but it only has arms. 
* I was going to buy a heart rate monitor specifically for this game, but it doesn’t affect gameplay so I don’t care. I’m just going to keep my Fitbit. 

Dislike: 
* I want more Monstercat, Porter Robinson and Madeon and electronic dance music. I only found one workout with EDM.  
Why is the “Genre” tab disabled? $20/month and I can’t even browse by genre? dealbreaker. 
* The volume was too low despite my maxing out the volume on the Oculus Quest. I use the same earphones with both headsets. I'm satisfied with 95% volume on Oculus Rift S, maybe because the songs are just louder. I 
* I cleared out a 6’x5’ space and I still smacked the wall at least once on each workout. Take a hint from Beat Saber and offer a 90 degree mode where I don’t have to move my feet so I stop destroying my controllers. That or add an explicit instruction to BUY a yoga mat to stand on. 
* According to my Fitbit, my heart rate only reached 105 average BPM across all of (2 ""medium"" workouts and one ""auto intensity"" workout). Same as Beat Saber. I wanted it to be higher. 
* The trainer needs to shut up and stop breaking my flow state.  Makes me feel like I'm in a sweaty gym instead of a cool Jedi. The trainer should only talk if my accuracy is falling to zero like an Expert+ Camellia Beat Saber song. 
* There is no evidence of the dynamic difficulty. Maybe that’s the point but I want to know how easy or hard it is. 
* The game feedback isn’t strong enough. There’s almost no difference between squatting a triangle and just taking it to the face (not squatting). And the controllers don’t vibrate when hitting something like they do in Beat Saber. The streams after the targets seem inconsequential
* Why is the “power” measurement normalized? I demand an absolute measurement in meters/second so I can see improvement. 
* The included sweat mask that the company shipped to me has nose flaps that pressed my nose in and prevented me from breathing. YES TRAINER ANTON, I’m trying to breathe but the nose flaps are suffocating me. 

I’m selling my Oculus Quest."

2618,Wicked11GSR,"May 23, 2020 at 6:52 AM",1,These devs are crazy.,"Content is nice, app is a buggy mess not even as good as BeatSaber was in early-release. App is a front for getting the cash flowing in and finishing the content and fixing the bugs later. Peloton fitness is $6 a month less and has live instructors. Local gyms for $20 offer free tanning, child care while you work out, classes, and interaction with a real person on how you are doing and how to improve. This app isn't full body tracking, it's just hands and head. There's no cameras to see your form. You might be getting a workout simply by doing it so fricken wrong it's work. The instructors/coaches constantly pep talk and never really shut up. Would be fine if it were targeting my actions with a response to do better at what I'm doing but it's not, it's an attaboy. Canned.

The app itself isn't bad, it's good. But the issue is the pricing. $20 a month is top of the fitness food chain for pricing without actually working with a personal trainer. App good, but business team needs to seek more investment capital and not try cash grabbing like this from a population forced to stay at home."
2619,CosmicCluster,"May 10, 2020 at 10:38 PM",1,"Good Idea, Poor Execution","First of all, you have to subscribe to this. As in nearly $20/month (as of May2020) which is more than buying a music pack for Beat Saber. Still, I liked the idea of mixing Beat Saber with a lower body workout. To start, the graphic locations were awesome.

Unfortunately, this app had a huge bug. The squat/lunge triangles kept getting smaller. Like, hurt myself smaller, requiring me to recalibrate constantly. Recallibration is a 2-3 minute tutorial you go through in the beginning of the game. So going through this EVERY time is obnoxious for something that takes 10 seconds (stand and hold buttons, right lunge and hold button, left side repeat, squat and hold buttons). 

I finally threw in the towel and quit the app when the triangles were shrinking in the middle of workouts. I contacted support when it was happening between back-to-back workouts about two weeks ago, but they had no advice and insisted someone else was using it (news flash, what did you not get when I said back-to-back workouts, as in no one touched the Oculus I still had on my head and I didn't get better at squats\lunges in 20 mins). Missing them comes with a hefty score penalty because they're worth more than hitting targets. For $19/month, it is not worth it.

Also nitpicking, their claim of having a vast mix of songs is a lie. In my time with the app, most of the workouts shared 6 songs. They were ok, but not my jams. Perhaps they'll add more later. The gameplay in Beat Saber is WAY better. The arrow sequence makes sense (typically have an up to a down, rarely have close up up, etc.) and I can change their colors to make it easier for me to differentiate left from right. Supernatural has neither of these. You may be hitting two ups in quick succession and the targets are black and white. I am an expert Beat Saber player, but on Supernatural I miss way more than I should..."

I wanted more of that and found out that this exists. Most of the songs have been fun too, and I know very few of them. That said, popular music can be very polarizing and the asking price of 20 bucks a month  is too inflexible for how high it is.

For music, I'd like to see groups or bands that no one has heard of. There's a ton of incredible undiscovered music out there that would fit really well with this game. A lot of popular music is already saturated to the point of exhaustion and its probably very expensive to license. The well known songs are a good selling point but there aren't a ton of popular songs I'm dying to hear more of. 

For price, I get it, it's much smarter to start where you want to be and scale down if you need to than to start low and then bring up the price, aggravating your active customers. This is however, a game on a gaming platform. Not many people are buying Quests FOR fitness, the fitness part is a bonus. A great bonus, but it shouldn't be confused for a Peloton. 

I will probably try at least a month of paid because I'm going to get at least that value out of the trial and it's extremely fun, but I think they should offer other plans in addition, such as letting you continue to access the game with a ""paused"" subscription for several months. Maybe pausing restricts the content, such as new workouts and new songs and expiring songs. When someone gets bored or want something new, they can unpause for however long. Whatever it may be, there is probably a way to bridge the gap of the people who want to enjoy this as an excellent rhythm/workout game, and the people who are inserting this into their lifestyle. I hope that balance can be found.

All of that out of the way, I have to say, these guys are on to something. For me, it's song for song more fun than beat saber, it gets me active and moving. I'm not as focused on hitting every note as I am making sure I'm using every muscle. Definitely looking forward to how this app grows moving forward."
2626,Jen,"May 15, 2020 at 10:10 PM",4,Great app but needs improvement,"I've been playing for a week and I am already a convert! 

Pros: 
* new workout every day - obviously this is a huge selling point to keep things from getting stale
* I love that it has a lower body component, this is a huge plus over Beat Saber
* I love the views - it's a great way to feel like I'm actually outside instead of stuck in the house all day
* The trainers are a nice personal touch, I like that they don't talk as much as your average gym instructor, just a bit from time to time to help me refocus
* Auto-intensity is a great way to keep the workout calibrated to my own fitness level

Cons:
* White orbs are sometimes difficult to see against clouds, snow, ice etc.
* Price point - $19/month is fairly steep for only 1 new workout a day. I locked myself in at the $149/yr rate but still I would like to see more varied content for that amount of money
* More focus on legs. I know it's hard to do anything without some sort of leg controller/band, but I would like something other than squats and lunges. I can see some form of jumping working - can you track the vertical position of the headset to see if the user is jumping over some sort of virtual obstacle? With the right obstacle & orb pattern you might be able to incorporate jumping jacks. 
* There are times when I find myself trying to keep up with a ton of orbs and then I forget to squat or my lunges have poor form. I get a better workout with fewer orbs in fewer complicated patterns, because then I don't have to focus on figuring out the next pattern and I can instead concentrate on proper form. If this is going to be a fitness app, the focus should be on getting a good workout not hitting as many orbs as possible. This isn't Squat Saber. Obviously this a challenge because part of the workout score is the number of orbs you hit correctly. Maybe incorporate an accuracy measure that gives you a higher score if you hit the orb right in the center of the target as opposed to slightly off center?"
2627,Fire,"Apr 25, 2020 at 4:45 AM",2,"Great App, Buuuuut......","I'm a professional boxer and agree that the work out experience is great and fun. It's visually nice as well. I will continue to use the free month trial but will immediately cancel the ridiculous subscription of $20 month. Are you kidding me?... I get the same fun work out with BoxVR and Beat Saber. However if it was a flat rate like all the other games, I would definitely buy it for $29. I would even consider $40. Now I'm guessing the reason they are trying to game us for that rate is because of the unnecessary trainers they are paying to be a part of the program. WE DON'T NEED THEM! Leave them for one purpose, the tutorial or an introduction on how to move and hit the objects, etc. That's it! We don't need to hear them say the same thing over and over if I wanted to choose the same program because I really like the song being played. This is why you're making us pay every month? Keep the programs and lose the trainers. Take a page from BoxVR. They've done it right. I know you may want to be different from them but it really is already unique with and without the trainers. I love the fact that you can continue to play with out losing if you miss to many objects unlike in Beat Saber whereas I can focus on getting a workout. Also if you feel you MUST keep the trainers... make it optional for us to SKIP them or to use them at all. Some of us don't want or need the warm up. Let us skip it if we want. Add more workouts. There's not much offered. With all that said, I love the workout part, it's absolutely fun but I will be passing on it once my trial is done. Too bad."

Dance while playing beatsaber and youre good

*update* devs tell me try the free trial, i didnt even see one, it was tutorial then straight to a *YOU CANT PLAY UNLESS YOU PAY*

This is literally not worth the money i advise all to seriously get a free workout outside in the sun, just implement the lunges with punches and arm swings outside in the sun


If youre going to do subscriptions, YOU BETTER BE A WELL KNOWN DEV THAT PPL CAN TRUST SO WE KNOW YOU WILL BE ON IT WHEN THERES AN ISSUE, FOR 19 A MONTH YALL BETTER BE CONSTANTLY ADDING NEW MUSIC, CUSTOM MUSIC, NEW ENVIRONMENTS, etc



Unless these devs are foolish and stubborn, all their hardwork is going to burn to the ground, atleast from my observations in video games and ive been playing games since 1990 (5yrs old) 


ITS QUARANTINE TOO!  LOT OF FINANCIAL ISSUES RN ARE YOU GUYS FOOLS? BAD TIME TO MAKE PPL PAY FOR A WORKOUT WHEN THEY NEED BASIC NEEDS FIRST


If there is something to make this  “game” worth it, it would be an online coop type workout together mode with multiple ppl, dont know how itll work, but something where you can interact with live ppl



Us players do not give a rats anus where the devs money goes to, using that to settle us down doesnt work, shouldve thought it out better instead of trying to create some silly authoritarian style training that has to be paid for, i heard theres no muting of trainers, no music choices, warm ups before every play, no options no diffculty of choice on music, just how they want to you play"
2630,Piotr Szymański,"Apr 24, 2020 at 8:21 PM",1,Honest review,"I have tried the game, so I think I have the right to put my review here. Especially that it is not paid review;)

If it was Beat Saber 2 I would pay 30 $ at one time and give 5/5.

Everything here is prettier than in Beat Saber. But the creators are lying. There is nothing more here. Playability is the same. Cubes turned into rocks. Blocks in triangles. It's also 360 degrees here. Workouts are all talk during the song. Daily new workouts are equivalent to custom songs at Beat Saber. Only that licensed. The only advantage Supernatural is appearance. It's very nice. The setting is great.

But you can't call it Beat Saber 2 because they are other creators. I am surprised that the creators of Beat Saber do not react.

The game is 5/5 the same as Beat Saber, but 1/5 for copying all the mechanics.

These workouts are simply songs with added motivational commentary. A well-done map in the Beat Saber editor will give you the same. Only without saying a word.

Give the opportunity to buy once for $ 30 I will buy. Unless Beat Saber sues you sooner. However, subscribing is not worth it.

I would think about $ 5 a month. More is crazy. $ 20 is theft. The information that 20 $ is a promotional price is insane.

To sum up - the game is beautiful, but in mechanics it's Beat Saber. It is worth installing and playing for a free month. However, I do not believe that the subscription model will work. This game is not worth it."
2631,Amante,"Apr 24, 2020 at 9:31 PM",1,Great Gag :-( Not Free Not Cool :-(,"Not only is it not free as it states (just to get you to download), but they want $20 a month to go any further after the introduction, very disappointing. All kinds of cheaper VR games to get the same body movements/work out moves, and if you are looking for a excellent workout with trainers to show you how, use YouTube search Planet Fitness, there are plenty of other workout videos on YouTube also, but Planet Fitness has a great lineup for different style (what they call Work-ins) free and you can join them on Facebook for their live work-ins @4 pm PT (not sure if this is free, I work during this time). I didn't and don't have a membership with them, but when this Covid-19 is over, I will most definitely will be joining them. They have went way out of their way to help us stay healthy during these horrific times :-) !!! I know this review is VR vs Video Workout, but for the price you are wanting to charge and deception of stating free, I will stick with video trainers."
2632,Kavorca,"Jun 11, 2020 at 10:08 PM",1,"Great workout, poorly executed","I've really enjoyed my time using Supernatural. The workouts are solid and the trainers are good. That being said, I've never had so many issues with a game losing track of the controllers. 

I am constantly having the right bat lock into place and I'm unable to move it because the game lost track of it. It has only happened once with the black bat but it's every session with the right one. Yes, fresh batteries and a fully charged headset. That's not the issue. It's the only game I've ever had tracking issues with.

The other thing is the targets themselves. I see why they call it Supernatural because you have to be a mythical creature with four elbows to hit some of them. Some tracks are great while other are ridiculous. I've noticed since the last two patches tracking has gotten worse and I am getting standing targets way out of reach too low or too high. No, it's not during a lunge or when the portals change positions. I'm talking about targets dead on coming towards you and being out of reach.

I ran through the calibration three times now and still have issues. I'm the only one that uses it.

Oh, and when you sign up they say they'll send you a silicone face cover for you headset. Still holding my breath on that."
2633,Danni,"Apr 24, 2020 at 4:44 PM",4,"It’s a 5 ⭐️ experience, but...","It’s great, I actually love the experience, really really love it 😍. It’s worth paying for I think.... $4.99 - $7.99.... sure a month? sure! Even $9.99 if you include fantasy environments and go boldly with how SUPERNATURAL you get, Just not $19 a month. Please make more fantastic environments and not just “realistic” ones, make those orb things ghost 👻 and make the environment a graveyard and play thriller and heads will role... that would all be worth a monthly investment! I really think you can do this... go crazy with it and we will buy it... I might pay extra for “Fantasy trainers” 

(Update!) Day 2 there was nice “Off planet” environment! Cool! Also... please add not 360 workouts and some easier workouts... I’m enjoying it but it get TOO intense on EVERY workout... you have some with limited mobility and can’t access all the motions as quick. Don’t neuter them all, add some more less intense flow type exercises."
2634,Andy,"Jun 17, 2020 at 1:32 AM",4,Fun!,"I really like the workouts and I don't mind the price but I would love to see more retro and 80's music...or to just be able to pick a genre. Music is a big part of my workouts and if I don't like the music, it's not as motivating. Thanks for the work that has been put into this!"
2635,Aeternitatix,"Jun 13, 2020 at 9:44 PM",2,Should add a simple feature: solo songs,"The biggest problem with this game is that it forces you to play in a single, restrictive way: you can only select from fixed playlists, which require you to play multiple songs in a row with no break in between and which have mandatory personal trainer commentary throughout.  This would be a much better product if it also included the ability to play individual songs separately with no (or optional) personal trainer commentary.  If this feature alone is added, I would change this to a 4-star rating; and if the developer continues to refine and add more features, it could easily warrant 5 stars.  The core experience (maps, songs, backgrounds) is solid, but the whole package is too limited and restrictive at this point.  (I even like the personal trainers, and would still use them; but there are also times I just want to enjoy a single song/map with no commentary.)

One other, more minor issue: Follow-the-trail parts should have some sort of in-game feedback to convey if you're hitting the mark or not.  The rocks explode if you hit them correctly or bounce off if you use the wrong bat, the triangles pulsate in different ways to show hits/misses, but there appears to be no feedback at all for the trails."
2636,Martin,"Apr 27, 2020 at 12:02 AM",5,Great workout /litle frustrating,"Its great work out I sweat a lot, but it frustrating when you dont hit couple targets and you loose temp because if it, its really hard for start, today was my first workout.

I will continue for 30 days but i don’t thing i will pay subscription after"
2637,peanutbutterspice,"May 12, 2020 at 3:49 AM",4,Probably the best VR workout app,"I would write a long-form review but I’m using my phone. 

For the Pros:
1. The workouts are full 360 degree experiences. They encourage a full range of body movements and emphasize hitting targets harder rather than throwing a million targets at you at once (i.e., Beat Saber Expert or Expert+)
2. Integration with heat rate tracking monitors and the like. Supernatural also displays the heart rate zones you were in while you worked out. 
3. Graphs of your heart rate, accuracy, and hitting power over time

Neutral:
1. The song selection is hit or miss.., but that is largely fine. I’ve done a lot of cardio and training sessions to music I didn’t particularly care for
2. The difficulty scaling seems to be a bit wonky. I was a bit out of practice my first workout since I hadn’t played Beat Saber and the like for a couple of months. Man, it was absolutely killer. At times it felt unrelenting. It didn’t hinder me, I just kept going and focused on getting what I could, but I could see it becoming a big problem for newcomers. 
3. The price. This one is a bit up in the air at the moment since it hinges on what they bring to the table for each month. The number of workouts available right now is fine. They’ll need to provide more if they want to keep a subscription model though. 

The Bad:
1. Stretching periods after workouts are laughably short. If you do a 25 minute workout a 30 second stretching session is absolutely inadequate. I would like to see an option to select a stretching period. I.E., selecting 5 or 10 minute stretching periods. Make them guided by instructors. 
2. No workouts currently exist that are longer than ~25 minutes. 

Over all it is probably the best VR workout app available IMO. I’ll likely keep using it, even after the trial ends as long as they keep adding workouts and improve what is there 

I would also like a larger variety of music. Put in some metal tracks for those sessions focused on strength and power. Add ambiance based tracks (Think Tycho, etc.,) for more relaxing sessions. Electronic music (Com Truise, FM-84, Timecop, etc.,) would also be a great candidate for workouts. That is just my two cents."
2638,Slavik,"Apr 25, 2020 at 1:28 AM",1,This service is very buggy.,"When I install it and play first hour, I was exited how good is it, but then I was disconnected after one of song, I start training anew but after next song I was disconnected again. Next day I even can't start any training, it constantly show message about connection problem, with ""try again"" button. It is impossible to use it, I very disappointed. I have no connection problem with other apps and video on my Quest, you should fix your server side."
2639,ZVRMaster,"Apr 23, 2020 at 11:38 PM",3,Beautiful surroundings; play inaccurate,"I anxiously awaited this app's debut. Unfortunately, after my son and I spent about 30 minutes in the app, we're really disappointed. The locations are beautiful, and I enjoyed the music. However, the play is awkward and inaccurate. It seems that the app is having trouble calibrating properly because the objects are so high you can't reach them or the app isn't recognizing when you hit the objects that are at the correct height. And speaking of hitting objects ... if you're a Beat Saber player, the movements seem to be the exact opposite of those in Beat Saber. Very confusing!

The subscription price of $20 a month is a little too high for what this app offers. I don't even know if I would be comfortable paying $5/month. 

Pros
Aesthetically beautiful (images and objects)
Cool music
Interesting concept

Cons
Calibration is wonky
Monthly subscription is costly
Doesn't seem to have an option for more than one player"

2644,Clover,"Apr 24, 2020 at 6:46 AM",3,"Great gameplay & concept, but expensive.","Supernatural is a game which truly wears out the body, it's wonderful music is something you don't see in other games, really gets you to move, and straight to the point. I love that you can pair your watch to track heart rate and getting instructed by a pre-recorded trainer, but... The cost is worrisome, and I'll, unfortunately, be cancelling my membership. I'll still be playing, though! The cost is around 6 USD more than Peloton, which has live instructors instead of pre-recorded. Heck, we even have a quite good gym here in the city that's 15 CAD per month, making it the cheapest out of these two when converted to USD. 25 CAD a month is a huge yikes, and Supernatural will most definitely have to change to compete with it's competitors; either adding enough content and features for the subscription to have great value for it's price, or the price is lowered. 9.99 USD a month sounds like something I would pay at most."

Loved the first workout...standing in those stunning landscapes from all over the world is simply out of the world. I will get membership, I was sure. 

I was a 2-hour a day gym person(fairly fit) and was enjoying it. My heart rate was going up, living the scenery, smashing the orbs. But wait, what just happened here? There are orbs coming from everywhere, going everywhere, no rhyme or rhythm to them. Am I supposed to focus on amazing squats and smashing power and stretching or is it a puzzle game now where I have to confusingly flail here and there without any sense? Who teaches that kind of workout? At least maintain a pattern for 15-20 seconds. 

Soon I get so frustrated I just quit and go to Beat Saber (which has easy, normal and higher levels. I play hard level in most songs but they’re easier than any Supernatural workout...and that’s not a compliment). Maybe have workouts at different levels..some where you can actually focus on breathing and power and heart rate, and other where people who just want to flail their arms can do that. Or have different levels for each workout like BS. Tried a few different workouts and same problem with each after a few minutes. I think I’m done with this game."

I want to be better, but I need to be eased into things and this just throws it all at you at once. It’s almost so much that you get disheartened. I can never really tell if I am hitting targets even though I appear to be on the beat. It says it adjusts to your level but ya, no?  How many times do I have to miss targets and stand through 30 lunges in a row before that kicks in?  I love the concept. Love the songs that I have played so far but want to focus on form and that is hard to do when everything comes at you at once and there is no way to say EASY!!!!  I can do lunges and squats that fast in a row or I can hit targets that fast. Both at the same time is just a recipe for failure. I hope they fix this for old and out of shape folk who want to change a lifestyle."
2647,Micael Carvalho,"Jun 7, 2020 at 10:49 AM",3,Nice at first; disappointing after,"The game is subscription-based. Understandable, since they're paying people to ""pretend to be workout coaches"", and also use paid songs. But the price is too high for the problems in the following

1. No recentering. I was hitting my lamp in full swings, so I pressed the Oculus button to recenter and the app crashed. Had to go through the entire menu + warmup before getting back to where I was, no resume possible. Feels like an alpha release

2. Coaches are 2D videos. Move around, there is no depth, their centering in the mat is off, they slide away when you move. Doesn't even look like a dual camera recording

3. No feedback on the player. Coach kept saying ""very good"", ""excellent"", and I wasn't moving at all. This is only voice, no video; why not record a separate voice track saying something motivational for players lagging behind? Pause the game and play a message! You are charging a hefty price that is higher than a single game purchase per month, act like it

4. No way to adjust the level. A newbie would miss on half or more of the workouts because even for me they cannot be fully completed; I play expert++ in other games and I cannot deal with some here (??)

5. Sometimes impossible to get right. This Saturday's workout had some swings that are physically impossible to accomplish: my controllers would shatter from the speed, or it required my arms to cross each other without touching. How can such a level be released without anyone testing that a 100% score is possible? I got so demotivatedthat I abandoned the game — closed it and went to play something else

6. Swing detection is garbage. I cannot stress this enough. Sometimes the swing is perfect, and visually your bat went the right way and touched the target, but and the game doesn't recognize it, target passes the bat like it was invisible and misses it

7. Haptic feedback on bad swings is even worse — only a ""plop"" sound from the balloon going away, no vibration or anything. Feels extremely unnatural"

The only time I sweat this much at the gym is full court basketball. The views are great, the motions all make sense from an exercise standpoint, and it really pushes you.  I’m sure more content will come in time so I have no gripe there - it’s early.  The main issues I’ve personally had are with the hit tracking being unresponsive at times and the pacing.  It feels like at times it’s unrealistic to be able to make all the hits no matter how fit and quick you are.  Definitely recommend this app, especially during this quarantine.  I do agree with others that the price is a bit steep for what it is right now.  As the title says, good, not quite great yet."

2651,JT,"Apr 24, 2020 at 7:06 PM",3,Still needs work...,"I sort of wanted to rate this two stars, but I am trying to not be mean just because I was so frustrated with the game & app. I liked the concept & tracking and it does get your heart rate up, but the play and bugs were super frustrating. Add the monthly cost in and I really don't know if this is a keeper. I get an equally good workout playing Beat Sabers and I have better control of the difficulty. Maybe at $10 a month I might not hesitate since there are some part of the play that I do like better than Beat Sabers as a workout game.

I almost uninstalled the game because you can not exit out of the tutorial. If you can exit it was not working for me. I pushed every button, held every button and ended up having to sit through the tutorial four times to get to the main menu because I mistakenly restarted the tutorial three times. Clicking too fast and stuff I guess. The only option I could figure out was to completely exit and restart. It did not seem to remember that I had done the tutorial for a couple times. When it did, I found the wording a bit confusing and ended up doing the tutorial again. It should say something like ""Start tutorial!"" and not just ""Get Started"" or what ever it said. Guess I'm a bit slow and click too fast, but when a game makes me feel stupid I think the game is stupid, just being honest. It is a workout for goodness sake, not brain teaser. If I do this right after getting up I really don't want to have to think too much. Nit picking, I know. 

In the tutorial and workout it kept losing tracking of the hand units. Loading was slow and some times the play was jerky. Might be misunderstanding dynamic, but this game did not seem to adapt for me. I did the morning work out and the game play was too hard but the activity level was fine. Like to see difficulty better indicator or a way to set the difficultly. For now, I would say Beat Sabers is a better buy, but if they drop the cost and fix the bug maybe."
2652,Robert,"Apr 24, 2020 at 4:14 AM",4,A Fantastic Foundation For A Fitness App,"This is a day one review and I am sure Supernatural will continue to improve over time.  I want to thank the developers for working on this program.  I really enjoy the foundation of the experience.  

Let's start with the major gripe. The subscription seems to be a major issue for people... and it is up to you to see the value.  I see value in the subscription so far because I like the coaching and it feels like it was designed to be a fitness app from the ground up. It offers relevant tips and I find the coaching encouraging.

None of the other VR programs really feel like a fitness program.  They always feel like rhythm games that you can use to get some good cardio ETC.  This feel much more like a fitness program where I am being coached through the process.  I feel better about pushing myself because I can follow their tips and worry less about injuring myself because of bad form.  One example was the trainer said ""Don't forget to relax the tension in your jaw.""  She was right I was tense and it did help... its a small touch but it goes a LONG way to make me feel like I am really working out versus playing a game. 

I took one star off because there is some room for improvement.  I would like to see different color options for the targets.  Black and White is good and looks clean, but when your looking at the sky or into the sun in the environment it blends into much and you can't read the targets.  

The timing of swinging could be tweaked just a little.  The timing of when you hit the targets feels a bit off. It seems weird and slightly off. it registers better when you hit the target with the  handle of the bat and less with the tip...   It feels like I am punching not swinging a bat.  If you swing through like your playing tennis it helps.

Small gripe but I wish the bats had some feeling of interaction when they tapped against each other. It would help immersion if they did.  

I look forward to seeing how the developers and the trainers improve over time."
2653,WeatherWimp,"Apr 24, 2020 at 5:32 AM",4,"Very promising, and very different","I have many of the apps some compare this to, and Supernatural is very different. I also think it has a lot of potential. 
 
+ Apple watch (and iphone and Android phones too I think) integration is great. While it may seem silly, tracking my workouts in a dedicated zones app (along with the supernatural app) is motivating. 

+ I believe the difficulty of the blocks/triangles having you swing, lunge or squat alter with your performance while you are actually doing the workout. I’m pretty sure I read this, and even noticed it when I was tired and the triangles didn’t seem to have me lunging quite as deeply. 

+ The bigger, sweeping movements seem better thought out than other games

+ The instructors are a big plust for me, and I don’t know why. I’ve never been able to get into fitness videos or apps that are instructor led before, but for some reason the encouraging to be on my heels during a squat, you can do this type attitude helps a lot in this game.

- The one knitpick I have is I’m not sure how all the scoring for rewards works. Yes, it counts up how hard you hit stuff, how many you hit or squat/lunge in triangles, but it looks like there are brone / gold / etcl awards too. Do I need to move up if I’m getting gold medals? Do a different workout if I’m only getting bronze? Are these just given out based on your supernatural score? 

Obviously the other negative would be the fitness app level pricing for a subscripiton, but that is just what it is, and not uncommon it seems in the fitness industry. the key will be what they provide for that subscription. 

If the content / workouts updated daily make this keep feeling fresh and keeps more motivated to use the app most days of the month they’ll get mey money...easily. If not, I’ll go back to some non-subscription games."

The mapping isn't quite as well done, the tracking is a little off, but the experience is one of the best workouts I've had in VR. I do have a couple of suggestions: let us choose whether we want the warmup and cooldown, as it breaks my flow. Let us turn off the trainers completely if we want, I've never been one for workout guru platitudes. Let us string the workouts together into longer sessions, maybe a survival mode or something that just continues until failure. To the people complaining about the subscription, consider this: would you still be playing Beatsaber if you couldn't mod it and use legally questionable material? Other apps don't have this ability; Beatsaber was lucky enough to exist before VR went mainstream, and as of yet artists aren't enforcing copyright. For an app to remain fresh without this black market they MUST charge a subscription, it's the only way to stay afloat. This app is pioneering a new model, we'll see if it works."

2658,Momofflowers,"Apr 24, 2020 at 9:06 PM",3,Tried it wasn’t impressed,"So I’ll start with saying I’m probably not their target demographic. There is no way that I would give that much monthly to play a game. Not gonna happen. I understand they are trying to market as a home gym thing but the gyms around me are as much per month as this game and offer different equipment and real life instructors. 
Now for the gameplay. The surroundings were beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous. The music was good. I don’t know if it’s supposed to be like this but I found myself looking down at the instructors and floating several feet from the platform which meant that in order to fit in any of the lunge or squat triangles I would have had to practically do the splits. And some of the low swings would require me to squat/duck/lean down to hit them. That seems like a crucial misstep in calibration. I even jumped back to the home to make sure my guardian floor was set correctly. It was. 
There was no feedback to the arcs or trails. And very little feedback to the actual orbs and triangles making me wonder did I make any of them , the end results said yes. 
I also didn’t like that it needs a whole nother separate app on my phone. 
Having an instructor is great but at the same time wouldn’t it be better to have the option to just jive away with the music instead of the constant barrage of good get low keep those hips open keep your spine straight blah blah what’s the point of having good music if your going to talk over it the entire time. You’d be better off using indie stuff and not paying licensing at that rate. 
I have gave up halfway through the workout frustrated and disappointed. 
I really think they’re going to have to rethink their subscription plan and work on the game mechanics a bit more. If they worked on better calibration I might try it again as a 30 or 40 one time purchase. As it is I’m uninstalling."

2662,anime_reference,"Jun 7, 2020 at 10:23 AM",2,there are better alternatives,"There's no way I can recommend this game, given the price tag, when its ""fun"" competitors have *significantly* better hit tracking. 
Like, if you're playing a game where you swipe towards oncoming blocks in certain directions, you probably want the game to be able to track when you hit those blocks. This one doesn't do that reliably.

Also, there's absolutely no warning in the tutorial, but this is a 360 degree experience. I punched several things in my room that'd normally be safe behind me

EDIT: I forgot to mention the fact that you CANNOT re-center the view by holding the oculus home button.

Problem is, I think the execution doesn't really add up. The biggest issue I found its that there is no flow. It's hard too to compare to Beat Saber. In Beat Saber you can get into a fun flow and feel the music in your movements. In Supernatural though everything feels erratic and random. Also, the backgrounds are pretty locations but they quickly become uninteresting once you're focused on the workout and the background isn't dynamic. I do like the music overall and the coaches encouragement is good. I hope they are able to update it and fix the for issues. I think the price needs to be closer to $10 also.

2668,Evan,"May 6, 2020 at 5:49 AM",3,Curated Beat Saber + Photogrammetry,"After playing the free trial for a few days, I doubt I'll be paying for the monthly subscription. I'm not opposed to that business model, it's just that what I've seen so far doesn't live up to its promise. 

The ideal version of this would be great - carefully curated songs and well-designed maps that use the slash-targets mechanic to get you moving and work different muscles, all compressed into 20 minute workout playlists - this could be perfect for someone who'd like to put on a headset and get a quick workout with fresh songs every day, knowing that the selections would actually make you move your body and raise your heart rate. And some of the workouts I've tried do this very well. The best maps seem to be tailored to encourage wide, open-arm movements with sweeping follow-through, and the targets are placed in a way to encourage room-scale movement, including turns, squats, and lunges, and most maps seem designed to work your lower body. However, some of the faster tracks fall into the ""wrist flicking"" category with targets coming so fast that full-body movement is not possible. This could be fixed by more careful mapping, of course, but it's disappointing to see this type of map in the first few workouts I've tried. 

I understand why the app focuses on curated workouts, and won't give you a full song list (I imagine this has to do with music licensing as well), but it would be nice to have a practice or song-select mode.

The photogrammetry backgrounds are nice, though there seem to be a fairly limited number of them, and the coaches voiceover is actually helpful rather than annoying as I'd feared. 

Ultimately it'll only be worth a subscription to me if they can dial-in the mapping better and avoid the beat-saber-expert-plus wrist-flicking in favor of maps that encourage smoother movement.

Update: going to cancel before they can charge me; the last couple workouts I've tried have just compounded my complaints above."
2669,moses,"May 31, 2020 at 7:28 PM",3,Nice Start - needs more development imo,"I love the sceneries, I think the mapping is great most of the time. I wish I could mute the trainers at times because when I’m in a flow I seem to mess up when the trainer starts talking about form or endurance and my thoughts shift to those things as balls are flying at me and suddenly I’m missing the targets. 

Most importantly I don’t feel I’ve worked out after a workout. I feel I’ve succeeded in striking targets. 
I do however get my cardio in so I guess we can count that as a workout? 

There has to be something for me to gage how powerful my strikes are along the way because honestly I don’t know. In BoxVR I can see point values and green points for more precise/powerful strikes. In RacketNX I am rewarded with hard strikes as I see the direct influence I have by the visual and audio effect directly related to my hit. I need feedback and not at the end of the session. This can be a feature to toggle on/off as desired. 

I am not a fan on most of the music on this app and that also affects my workout. I have to deal with songs that I’m coming to loathe from hearing again and again. Songs I never liked in the first place. Being able to use our own purchased songs would be lovely. 

I think the trainers are wonderful and full of life and good vibes- I wish them all well and hope this app will morph into something everyone will come to love and enjoy on a daily basis. I think I will give it another month and see if any changes are made.

I also enjoy the scoreboard as it encourages me to keep working out (although I feel I’m just striking targets). I’m not sore after a workout on here but I am sore after boxing or playing RacketNX."
2670,Mark,"May 8, 2020 at 4:56 AM",2,A good start,"The ""Personalized dynamic difficulty"" doesn't seem to be working and there is no way to make things a little slower. Ususally the workout starts at an ok pace and then speed up but by the time it gets to maximum the speed is way too fast. Obviously this varies from person to person but right now the higest speed leads me to exit the app in frustration.

There needs to be a way to turn the ""coaches"" off. Right now you can lower the volume but not turn them off. Their comments are not useful and so they are just annoying.

For me personally I would like to keep working out in the same location for the whole workout and not keep changing after every song, again it is a disruption. Changing to a new location for each session is great. It might also reduce the load time between songs."

2672,liquidbuffet,"Apr 30, 2020 at 11:14 PM",3,Could be good,"I like the idea of the app.  There are beautiful locations, the trainers are generally good, and it is an enjoyable workout.  However, the app seems to be at odds with the message.  This is supposed to be a workout that focuses on form and power, as is stressed in the intro.  However, many of the songs just fill the screen with targets and create a situation where you are just trying to hit all of the targets.  This leads to a “Beat Saber” type situation where you feel sweating because you are flailing your arms, but you are not getting a good work out.  For instance, in today's work “Perfect Day” one of the first songs had limited targets and a cool rhythm section that forced you to slam the bats up and down and allowed me to focus on power, which caused my heart rate to jump into zone 5.  The next few songs contrasted that with a whole lot of targets and a whole lot of arm flailing, leading me to drop my heart rate to zone 4.  I get that there is this dynamic difficulty setting, but I don’t want this to be “Beat Saber”  I want it to be more like “Box VR,” where you have time to focus on hitting targets and power.  Unfortunately, although I like the polish of this, and it can be fun, I am going to go back to “Box VR” for its core dynamics and cost."

I can feel the workout in my legs which is good but the game is just not fun, beat saber managed to get people moving without them realising it.  The scenery is nice, trainers models could do with a bit more work as their heads seem to be on a long neck that kind of comes towards you.  I'd like to see rectangles come into the game like beat saber has as I think they are better than the triangles that this game went with.  Focus less on the music and getting licensed tracks and more on game play, get your own licensed music like beat saber did and put some EDM in to really get people moving."
2675,Mark,"May 5, 2020 at 5:27 AM",2,Dissapointing,"My wife and I both tried out the tutorial.  We were both really disappointed. It was kind of boring and the movement felt very unnatural and awkward.  The non-stop “coaching” was a bit annoying too.  We much prefer a few rounds of BoxVR, Pistol Whip and Beat Saber for our VR workouts.  I don’t think we would be willing to pay a monthly fee, but I’m really disappointed that they wouldn’t at least include 2 or 3 levels in the tutorial.  Maybe it gets better, but based on the limited tutorial I’m really not interested in this game, even if it was $20 flat instead of a monthly fee."
2676,StickymonkeyJam,"May 7, 2020 at 3:51 AM",2,Great workout.....except for ONE thing,"This is the best full body VR workout that I’ve tried. The movements are natural and make sense, the environments are very detailed and the music choices fit the workouts. The thing that really sets it apart are the trainers. Having a real human encouraging you and reminding you to use correct form is what transforms this into a real workout................but I can’t recommend it for one reason, the load times in between songs are terrible. It sometimes takes 3-4 minutes to load the next song and by that time you’ve completely cooled down from the previous song. That’s about 40% of your workout time JUST STANDING THERE WAITING. I “worked out” for 30 minutes and only got through 3 songs. They need to add longer songs (10 -15 minutes each) or improve the loading times, then I would definitely subscribe. Until then it’s near worthless for a good workout."
2677,AbominableK,"Apr 30, 2020 at 5:00 AM",2,Dynamic difficulty sucks,"I've done a few sessions with the app and feel there is a lot of potential but I can't see continuing with it as it currently is.  My biggest issue is the dynamic difficulty in the work outs that ramps up way too hard to the point where I'll just give up until things calm back down.  This is not supposed to be beat saber.  I'm looking for a good workout with controlled movements not widely swinging my arms around.  The best workout I actually got was on the only Easy workout in the game because I could actually focus on the movements and power.  

I've actually rage quit from a workout because I was overwhelmed with the difficulty.  Not how I want to feel after a workout.

I'll not touch on the price issue because that has been well discussed in other reviews already.

Maybe in future updates the dev will fix this and I'll be happy to update this review."
2678,ShippingMammals,"Apr 28, 2020 at 9:44 PM",3,"Meh, uninstalled/cancled in 15 minutes.","I decided to give this go after the buzz.  To start the game technically looks and works just fine. The visuals are nice etc., the mechanics work fine... the problem is it's just BeatSaber on steroids... and I don't like BS.  If you like BS then you'll likely like this if you're also into the fitness aspect of VR.  While I thought BS was initially ok, it quickly became boring. Once I found PistolWhip, and then TotF, BoxVR, & Creed I have not touched it since. It simply doesn't give me the work out I'm looking for, and neither does this. I know I only played it 15 minutes, but I didn't see the point after noping out of the one song. It's BeatSaber in a different skin.  That being said I can't fault it on it's execution on what it is doing.  It is clearly a well designed game, with beautiful visuals, but I found the following things deal breakers very early on outside of the boring beatsaber mechanic:

1. The unchangeable list of top 40 tripe they're calling music.  You can't choose the songs to listen to, so have have whatever forced on you.  Sure there were a couple I didn't -mind-, but I started a work out and the very first song after warm up I just noped out of because it was making me angry.   I understand you can't just drop a song in and keep the beat mechanic in tact, but.. just ugh...

2.  Someone else noted this - but they need change or up the sound made when missing a sphere.  It is hard to tell at times if you hit the target or not and I found myself turning my head to check quite often.

3. Never ending chatter from Trainers & inability to mute them.  VERY distracting and caused me to miss targets very frequently.

4. The cost. You -have- to be kidding me.  Now 20 bucks is not much to me, I'll spend twice that on lunch 3 times a week, but it's a cost vs. value thing, and they  don't equal out. 5 dollars would ok, 10 is pushing it.  I understand they went high - the music cost, trainer etc., but I think setting it at 20 is a strategically fatal mistake."
2679,brettsvergara,"Apr 25, 2020 at 12:38 AM",3,"Great concept, incredibly buggy","I’m really rooting for this app as I can see its potential to be an incredible and game changing VR fitness experience. I’m not even as bothered by the $20/m price point as other reviewers seem to be if the app is reliable with new content/songs/workouts regularly.

However, the reliability is really the Achilles Heel of this app. My major complaint is the game crashes near constantly (usually gets stuck in a loading screen) to the point it’s impossible to get through a complete workout. Even with multiple restarts of the app, it usually only takes about 5 minutes of gameplay for me to get stuck somewhere and needing to close out. That makes this app essentially unusable until this is fixed, hopefully ASAP.

Two other notes - the tracking isn’t 100% accurate to the point there’s just something that’ll feel ‘off’ with some targets you’re hitting and missing. That combined with really needing a ton of confident 360 degree space around you. Because of those two factors I found myself not being as bold in my movements as I could/should be - it’d be great if a 180 degree mode/ option were introduced so the core swings could still be there without needing the full 360.

Rooting for this app but I’m hoping these reliability fixes are made ASAP, otherwise I’ll be jumping ship after the trial.

EDIT 1: An additional note - there seems to be something off with how the game syncs with Apple Watch, I’m still having calories counting and I closed out of the game hours ago – pretty sure I didn’t burn 2,000 calories today..."

The trainings are very well made and I can see a lot of potential in this app. I cannot wait to see how it evolve on a day to day basis but I can't see how it will make me want to spend 20usd$ (I'm Canadian so about 30$) monthly.

Bad: 
Some of the orbs are off. I know i hit them, but it doesn't register. I've noticed that it's mostly peripheral ones. Also some of the orbs are unrealistic. If I'm swinging from right to left in a long arc because the white orb is on my left, how am i supposed to hit the the very next orb with the same color on the right side of my body in the same direction.
In the breathe exercise, she's talking about getting low into the triangles when there's no triangles. Either she's not doing it with us, or the a audio is off track.
There's no way to turn the coach audio off...
The price had been talked about already. Maybe $20-30 to buy and pay for each additional exercise is a better way? As it is, it's more expensive than a gym membership.
New exercises every day... Doesn't seem like a good idea. Once a week seems like a better plan otherwise there no reason to have leaderboards. It takes a few run throughs to get a good swing on the rhythms especially if you don't know the music (like me) and not everyone can do 20 min exercises several times a day.
Pairing to my phone. I don't understand why i had to do this. My fitness tracker is a whoop, and not on the list. Seems like the companion app should be optional.

Good:
Coaches are enthusiastic. 
Scenery is beautiful.
Exercises are on point and flow well.

I could see myself using this daily but not with new exercises daily. Sometimes you need a comforting routine that you know you can smash."
2682,Stephen,"Apr 24, 2020 at 11:32 AM",4,So good BUT....,"Come on, subscription? Better to do pay as you go DLC workouts. I don’t need fresh workouts at $19 a month. I think you should really rethink this because you have a really great product here. But we are not all made of money. The country’s in a huge recession. Not your fault, but maybe pivot like we all have had to do. At least until you have WAY more content available. 

pros: Made me sweat big time, polished game. Graphics are A+ for sure!

Need to be able to mute trainer if you so choose, as well as pick the songs you want. The lack of customization at this price point, well another ‘con’ IMO.  

Music, good and bad, but not everyone is into working out to songs that don’t vibe with them. That is were customizable workouts are needed (and maybe that is coming). 

Audioshield is a basic game in comparison, but i get almost the same intensity of workout and it sends the targets at me synced to any custom mp3 I want. Box VR, is really really good too and not monthly subscription either. I know its apples and oranges but there are some things to take away from their value as well. 

Loose the monthly fee and charge me for DLC and I will be ALL IN! I truly did have fun, and atmosphere is refreshing and spacious. Love the design of the targets and they feel perfect when you hit them. Squats are top notch. Much too love and much to miss when my trial runs out."

2) no samsung watches support, it's a huge drawback 

3)impossible to install app on android wear moto sport 360

4) no ability to sync forward\backward your fitnes progress with other apps such as google fit, samsung health etc.

5) trainers definatly lack an ability to be silence sometimes. I gues possibility to choose how often they will motivate the player will be good option. 

6)really missing boxing workouts, boxvr still is the best

7) price is a bit high. I suggest introducing two pay subscriptions, basic around 10 per month, and extended 20 per month. also 3 month, half-year plans with around 30-40 discounts need to be present

2687,CristyBen,"Apr 28, 2020 at 4:34 PM",4,Good Workout,"I’ve used the app for five days now. I really like it, and I’m definitely getting a workout. My heart rate is climbing up into the 170 range. Sometimes it says I miss balloons when I’m hitting them right on, as others have said but it will get better. 

It’s unrealistic to think that songs won’t ever be repeated and I like the music that’s being used so far, but I can’t wait for a wider variety of songs. 

Some people have said they don’t like the coach’s talking during the workout, but I like it. It keeps me going and focusing on what I should be doing. 

I have three suggestions:
1. Have a length option for each day:
- While I like that there is a new workout everyday and appreciate how difficult it is to create, it would be nice having a choice for a 20, 30, or 40 minute workout each day. I know I can always do a second workout, but then I’m going through a cool down then another warmup when I’d like to keep my heart rate up. 

2. More movement:
- I love the squats and the movement. While I know the bread and butter is hitting the balloons, I think the movement is amazing and would love to have more, even if that means sacrificing a some balloons. (Today’s workout was better than previous ones.)

3. Show where you are in the workout:
- When I’m working out, I forget how many songs there are for the playlist because I’m engaged in the workout. That’s a great thing!  It would be nice if at the start of the next song, or the end of the song you see where you are in the workout. 

Overall, it’s a great concept and I look forward to seeing how it improves (and how I get fit playing video games)."
2688,budderz67976,"May 2, 2020 at 7:00 PM",1,Not enough content for the money $$$,"Not only are there not enough workouts for anyone to be happy with, but it seems like all the current workouts are designed for VR experts who are already in great shape. I understand that they're supposed to be dynamic difficulty but it does not work well enough. For me the workouts range from really intense to deadly.

The game feels much less smooth and instinctual then games like beat saber or box VR. Hitting the notes properly just feels off somehow.

Don't get me wrong this would be an amazing game if the monthly subscription was $10 or less more workouts were added and there was options for less intensity."
2689,Quantum-mechanic,"May 13, 2020 at 8:38 PM",2,"It's cool, but doesn't really deliver","After trying out Supernatural for a few weeks, I have to say that I love the concept, but that I do not find that the application delivers on everything.

On their website, they feature six selling points: full body workouts, expert coaching, travel the world (cool locations), the best music, intelligent & personalized, and tracking progress. I find that they deliver on about half of these.

The locations and music are phenomenal, the fact that they are pushing out daily workouts is awesome, and their app does track your workouts.

But when it comes to the actual workout (or gameplay) Supernatural leaves a bit to be desired. One of the selling features is that ""workouts dynamically calibrate and respond to your body and effort"". After trying it out for a few weeks, I found that the application doesn't feel like it calibrates or responds to my body or my effort. In my experience, the dynamic workouts will ramp up to a difficulty level that is too high for me, and it doesn't ramp down when I start missing a lot of the targets. I personally find this very frustrating and that it gets in the way of me focusing on doing my best and having a good workout. This means that whenever a daily workout comes out and it uses the dynamic difficulty, I know that I am not in for a good time.

The trainers also do not feel super personalized. It feels like a pre-recorded track that doesn't actually respond to anything you are doing. The trainers are more similar to a video/TV workout and less similar to a trainer that you would see in a class setting.

Since the application/workouts do not feel like they respond to me, that the trainers feel like they are just pre-recorded and non-responsive, and that these things get in the way of a good workout, I don't see how I am able to justify the cost of the application. Had I felt they delivered on everything, I would have readily signed up for the annual membership for that $13/month price."
2690,DrFeelGood,"Apr 26, 2020 at 5:22 PM",1,Good and Bad - But $240/year is too much,"Okay here is the good:

The actual workout decent - you definitely get your heart rate up and quickly. In fact I would say this is the most intense workout app yet on Quest. The trainer talking can provide some motivation and help keep you on track. Seeing your heart rate pattern throughout the workout from your Apple Watch after your done is cool.

Scenery is great and I do enjoy that. Music is top 40 hits during your workout.

Okay now for the bad:

This is the worst rated app on Quest for a reason. If you signed up day one you’ll notice there are hardly any workouts. This is because they are developed daily for some reason and constantly updated. Cool concept but poorly thought out. What this creates is little content up front and potentially too much content down the road. Once you have 100 workouts in your library using the same game mechanics why do I need more?

The Apple Watch integration is cool, but the app is constantly opening when it shouldn’t and is battery draining in a noticeable way. This is upsetting because it’s one of my favourite features of the app.

The game mechanics are basically Beat Sabre in 360 mode. The beginner workout is great, but once it starts to pickup the pace it becomes very hard to keep up, if you don’t enjoy BS on expert mode you probably won’t enjoy this either. Also 360 can cause motion sickness. One of the things I like about BoxVR is I never have to worry about which hand to punch a target with, a workout app shouldn’t involve gaming skills IMHO.

Workout lengths are short so far, so if you are used to an app like BoxVR where you can pick your own length of workout you will be disappointed again, but that may change in the future as more workouts are added.

The music is top 40, so if you enjoy that then great. But unlike every other exercise app on Quest you cannot select your own songs to workout to.

The live trainers as a concept falls flat because I can’t see the person working out to see their forum or technique to ensure I am doing an exercise properly. Not really a live trainer as much as a voice actor talking throughout the workout.

Overall I would probably buy this for the scenery and workout intensity to add variety to my Quest workout routine, but at $240 a year I can’t justify making this my primary workout app with all the glaring flaws."
2691,Jeff.Wright,"Apr 27, 2020 at 11:51 PM",2,Not accommodating for those new to VR,"After spending the last few days try Supernatural as a fitness routine, I canceled my membership. I know it is a new app but only the Beginner lesson is any fun. The remainder quickly start going to fast to keep up with. 

Some pros for the app/service:
Integrates with HealthKit and Apple Watch
Positive reinforcement from instructors

Cons:
No ability to modify your workout
Majority of workouts require an advanced understanding and performance of the moves required. 

Overall I did start sweating while using the app, but the level of frustration I feel at only being able to hit half the targets is more than even the praises from the virtual coach could overcome."
2692,NonnaB,"May 2, 2020 at 9:04 PM",4,In my opinion.....,"First of all let me start off with I am new to the VR world, but have experiemented with MULTIPLE games/apps/programs over the last few weeks. I love my quest and its abilities so much we now have 3 total in our home. This is a lengthy review, but it touches on all points made in other reviews I read before I downloaded & tried this app.... I gave it 4 ☆ because the ""trial"" alone is worth the time!

This program should not be compared to BeatSaber, Synth Ryders or Box VR bc this is not a game (I have all of them). It IS a virtual fitness program with live personal trainers. You will have them in your ear & face throughout your work out/training, so not to mess up concentration, but to keep you on track and motivate you to push harder. You cannot mute them in person, lol.  They are there to assist to make sure you are using the right ""form"". As anyone who exercises, you know if you do not have the proper form you are not getting the most out of your work out and you could injure yourself. 

Imagery: Stunning is an understatement. I have not seen more life like images so real that you want to actually jump in and swim in the Galapagos Islands! Wander doesn't even have the crystal clear images that this app has - LOVE the serenity of the images. Even the volcano's seem relaxing when they should be terrifying 🤣!

Accuracy: 
As for accuracy in Striking, I do understand what everyone is talking about. I have noticed that my bat disappears occasionally once I pick up speed and have multiple cones. I have also missed the target when I know I should have hit it, although it was not during a ""standing"" position. I do not know yet, if it is in my own calibration at the beginning and/or a ""glitch"" in the program. Would be a good idea for the developers to look into. I restarted the ""training"" and set my calibrations a little bit further out and another a little less. The calibration seems to be the key. When you are setting calibration - you set your extension levels. Setting up calibrations and doing the actual work out are different. You are reaching, squatting and twisting in the workouts, when you calibrate - its just standing still... 

Finally, I take a deep sigh here as the topic of price is mentioned A LOT! Hell yes that is a steep price. Whether you have a family or are a single person, this monthly cost is too high. Now, I am older, with children & a grandchild. I also run a licensed daycare 12 hours a day, 5 days a week and have my own family after that. I also understand the costs of what goes into these programs, paying for licensing, paying the trainers and the royalty costs... BUT there are gyms (even with trainers) that charge $9.99/month that have major, continuous overhead charges such as equipment, maintenance/replacement on equipment, cleaning, building rentals and the employees, insurance etc... The ""Beach Body"" program is $100/year but they also have live interaction with coaches, meal plans etc. The goal in these types of programs are meant to aim at fitness & health, especially during the covid-19 pandemic. The cost of eating junk is much lower and the cost of getting & staying healthy is discouraging to busy, real life people & families who need accessibility to programs like this without adding stress of another bill. You can sell a few @20/month or hundreds of thousands for fraction of the price - a 3rd grade math student can see that makes more money! Hell disney plus charges $6.99/month to sit on your rear and get fat. 

#1 suggestion: Developers need to work on calibration techniques to account for quick movement and turns as a persons reach can go further or stop shorter with quick movement depending on speed.  

#2 I agree on the trainers talking, that once you get to pro and you have it down, there should be an option to either silence or at least adjust the volume on the trainer. 

#3 Change the monthly cost. Either one time charge or a drastically lower monthly cost. The VR is pricey enough, especially when you have more than one VR headset as I have 3... to purchase these programs PER headset is beyond ridiculous. The developers have the opportunity to get FAMILIES healthy & do it together with teaching/learning good habits that get passed on! Its a win win situation on every level: you make money, people gain more common ground with each other and focus less on social media gossip because they are too busy & happy to focus on negativity!"
2693,LROD,"Jun 3, 2020 at 4:45 AM",3,It’s ok,"I like the songs and how you hit the targets with the rhythm of the music. 
Sadly, sometimes there’s way to much spinning when following the targets, it makes me dizzy. I may just use through the free trial and most likely won’t be subscribing to the annual offer."
2694,TuRish93,"May 10, 2020 at 11:57 PM",4,"Great concept, very steep price point","Started using the free trial right on the day this app was launched. You definitely get a lot of upper body (specifically arms, shoulders and upper back) exertion but not enough lower body to call it a full body workout. Some tracks do a good job at making you squat or lunge repetitively but most focus on the speed and agility of your upper body. The heart rate during the workout comes close to when I am doing my regular HIIT bodyweight workout. However, I feel it is too expensive at $19/month especially when my HIIT bodyweight training app charges me $75/year for a premium full body workout subscription.
Don’t agree with some people mentioning the coach voices are disturbing. You can simply turn down their voice volume or honestly just let them be. It is very similar to if you were to train at a gym with a trainer or train at any sport. I’ve not known one trainer that keeps quiet and doesn’t push you constantly throughout your training.
Overall, worth a 30 day free trial and 4⭐️ but needs some more thought.

For the devs:
Some issues do need correction, for example, the controllers temporarily lose spatial calibration and appear floating at a random point. When it is a fast paced song, it is impossible to pause the workout and restart it to resolve the issue without missing a huge number of targets, not to mention that messes up the pace and the rhythm."

2700,BlakeD,"Apr 25, 2020 at 3:48 AM",4,Surprisingly good VR workout,"Getting past that sweating in a headset is a bit gross, this is a pretty good workout, and it does 360 songs better than beat saber, that are top 100 hits at that. The environments are fairly well done, and the personalized feeling sessions with volumetric captured trainers add the peloton feel. 

Biggest issue is that $29 is a steep price for having one type of workout even if it’s cheaper than a gym membership. I’ll play through the month as part of my routine, but will not renew due to price."
2701,MooMooKind,"Apr 25, 2020 at 6:16 PM",4,Awesome but tons of room for improvement,"I’m a huge Beat Saber fan and also love creative fitness ideas, so this was right up my alley! This review comes only after the initial intro and one training session (I’m in the 30 day evaluation). My first 15 min workout absolutely left me feeling like I got a solid workout. I was even sweating. Sadly my Apple Watch was charging so I didn’t get to pair it but I will next workout. The music and how it’s synced to the targets is excellent. 

Improvements: 
1.) I was super bummed to see the lack of social media sharing of a completed workout. Not only would this help spread the word of Supernatural but it shows social media friends that people are using it and having a great time doing so. I feel like this is a launch day failure. 
2.) Since the goal of a workout is fitness and not “failing a level” like in beat saber, I think the app needs to account for a larger target hitting area. I found that while I was super accurate it wouldn’t register some hits. That alone (by not feeling the shake of the controller) through off my next couple hits. 
3.) Price. This remains to be seen with the amount of content added. The trainers (as of this review) are nothing more than a voice over during a session. That being said I feel like the price is very high right now and I’ll likely cancel after 30 days if I don’t see more workouts and more trainer motivation. 
4.) target colors. We should have the option to change left/right target colors. The grey and black I found blended in a bit much to the background. 
5.) IPhone App. I feel like there needs more substance in the app. I also found a bug if you click add description and don’t add one that it doesn’t let you add it again. 


Overall it’s a good start. People are going to compare to Beat Saber but I think there is potential here. The price will need tweaking based on my comments above. You have me for at least 30 days to make an impression."
2702,XG,"Apr 25, 2020 at 7:58 AM",4,So much potentials,"Truly, I wanted to give it 3.5 stars but alas, here we are. After this long review, I will put my opinion on whether it is worth 19.99$/mo. 

Is it fun? Yes it is. It's like 360 degree beat saber plus some box vr with squats and lateral lunges. 

Is it a workout: yes. It definitely is a workout. It got me sweating after a few minutes.

Does the app itself work? I do think the tracking for my controllers isn't completely there, i.e: if I move my hands/controllers too far back. However, that's an Oculus issue I feel like, not the developer issue. 

Sceneries: the sceneries are beautiful I must say. 

Space: you do need bigger space than, for example, beat saber, because you will be moving 360 and be able to do later lunges in all those directions. 

What are these trainers? I echo everyone else's concern with these trainers being kinda annoying. I feel like there should be a built in feature to mute them if for example, I'm just not the type of person to want to listen to someone tell me to squat. 

NOW MOT: Is it worth $19.99/Mo? At this point? Definitely not. There's only 7 (or 8?) Workouts available. I sure hope more features will be added, like multiplayer, more songs, short and longer workouts and more functions... But until those features are added, I unfortunately don't think will be continuing after the trial. I will try this out for the month duration of course, and update as I go."
2703,Thermal,"May 9, 2020 at 7:12 PM",4,"Amazing, fun fitness","Supernatural puts you in breathtaking environments with wonderful trainers and music in a Beat Saber-like workout experience. Most auto/high intensity workouts have me working up a massive sweat and have me tired by the end. It's an amazing fitness/workout app.

A lot of people have said that $20/month is steep, and I agree somewhat. It's hard to recommend to people who want to get fit and workout casually, however for those who are dedicated to working out in VR, this is an amazing value! If you aren't sure, they do offer a free trial on their website. If you're interested but aren't sure about the price/value I'd recommend participating in said trial. (Also, they send you a sweat-proof headset liner/cover, free of charge!)"

First workout left my inner quads sore. Not being able to download my workout beforehand kills it for me, though. Sometimes takes over 5 minutes to download a track, or the game just crashes. I feel like there could be more forgiveness in the ball timing. I also wish there was a way to mute the trainers.

All in all, if your internet speed is good, it's a GREAT FUN workout. Even got my kid sweating and he never does anything that makes him sweat."

The automatic difficulty needs to go. I am very good at beat saber type games to this thinks I'm able to handle alot more than my body can take. Also the voice overs do not match each difficulty. They will talk about getting low yet.. no triangles. Also telling me your doing it with me is a flat out lie so just please take it out or actually do it while coaching. 

The price is steep for what we get. The coaching is not tailored to each difficulty and can be way off on the guidance. So I would hope they just make a easy,med,hard and have 3 different voice overs. 

Again I am really enjoying it just wish I could set my own difficulty and not have it be based off of how well I do with hitting the icons."
2707,chucklas,"May 1, 2020 at 1:11 AM",4,Much better workout app than expected,"I feel as though this was designed as an exercise app that has game elements and not the other way around.  Apps like beat saber are designed to be games first with the side benefit of exercise.  Supernatural is an exercise app with gaming elements.  They put the exercise first which is why the exercise routines are far superior to any workout you will find from any other quest app.  

I dropped it a star because it needs to be more customizable.  You cannot set difficulty on the workouts and I found myself almost stopping halfway through some of the songs.  I know the difficulty is supposed to adapt to your skill, bit I have not really felt that while playing.  Certain map designs just seem almost impossible for me and it can be discouraging.  In the tutorial the trainer mentioned pro vs novice or something like that, bit I could not find anything like it.

I love the trainers as it makes the workout feel like I am at a gym.  For me this is extremely helpful.  At the end of a routine, seeing my percentages is a nice gaming element that helps me compete against myself.  I also love that there are new routines each day and that I will not be repeating the same songs over and over like I do in beat saber.

TL/DR, if you want a workout, supernatural is great.  If you want a game, play beat saber."
2708,Outrunner,"Apr 24, 2020 at 1:18 AM",4,Good workout but pricey subscription,"The basics of the app including the interface, the graphics and sound are all very good. Everything is simple and easily accessible.

The 360 degree workout environments look good and it is cool to see the different geographic locations.

The songs so far that are part of the workouts are just o.k. They are geared toward 18-25 year olds it seems. Id like to see a bit more variety going forward as someone who is in their mid thirties.

As for the workout factor, they have done a great job. As a relatively in shape person, I started with a harder workout and i was breathing heavy by the end of the first song.

Now the problem i see is that $20 per month might be a bit more than most will want to spend. While this could certainly replace a gym membership, I’m just not sure the general population will go for it. 

Things i would like to see are some slower but squat heavy workouts."
2709,CloudTurtle27,"Apr 24, 2020 at 3:49 AM",2,Interesting concept poorly executed,"Interesting concept but falls short in execution. This game is basically beat saber with a personal trainer motivating you in the backround. The trainer is a nice touch not to mention the breath taking landscapes, but the game still falls behind on the most important element, gameplay. The gameplay itself is unoriginal, uninspiring and isnt challenging. When I strike a target there should be tactile feedback and a impactful noise to acompany it. Unfortunately all the music games (except for Audica) suffer from this. The subscription model is ridiculous considering you can buy a better game with all DLC content for a fraction of the price. To sum it up -

Pros-
Beautiful landscapes
Feels like you're actually working alongside a personal trainer

2710,Lundyman,"Apr 24, 2020 at 2:45 AM",2,First thoughts- not so good,"First off I was SUPER excited for the release of this game. I am very much into fitness games and have been playing a combo of Box VR, BeatSaber and Thrill of the Fight. I believe in fitness games for VR and have been seeing the benefits of them!! 
I will give this game several more attempts, but on the first couple tries here’s what I experienced:

CONS:
- I feel it is very strange in regards to the mechanics and hitting the orbs. Kept missing them and not a fan of them coming from all different ways. With fitness games, I’m not so interested in the challenge of high scores, like beat saber. I’m interested in getting a good focused work out that is fun, engaging and heart pumping.  
- i’m not a fan of the coaches talking (and breathing hard??) throughout the exercises. 
- some of the squats required you to hit orbs while squatting. This just felt awkward￼ (and again, takes away from the focus of doing it right)

PROS:
- The graphics were beautiful and amazing. I wish box VR had environments like this. 
- integration with Apple Watch
- I like the triangle version of squatting (vs a bar that just comes at you)

FINAL THOUGHTS:
- The bats and targets just seem awkward to hit. I almost wish they could just blend the awesome environments and graphics with box VR’s style of (shadow boxing) work out￼. I plan to keep playing the trial and update my review accordingly. ￼
** when it comes to the $20 subscription that everybody is (understandably) up in arms about – I would seriously consider investing in it if I felt the workout and gameplay was worth it. As of now, it’s not even close."
2711,MrTesla,"Apr 30, 2020 at 9:31 PM",3,Really great app but 2 major cons,"Love the app the work outs are great and do get my heart rate up. I am not even doing the pro level workout. It says the workout adjusts based on how well I am doing which I am not sure about as I have only used it 3 times so far. One feature suggestion would be I would like to see the trainer in a side window doing the workout. 

Cons
Like everyone says 20 dollars is way too much. I would be ok if there are no new locations that need scanning just songs should be fine.

There is no family plan which means I will have to sign up and pay for 6 different accounts and login and log off every time to switch accounts which is not very practical or affordable. 

For now if you are single and are the only user for your VR system and just use this app instead of a gym membership than it would make sense to pay 20 a month."

2716,MrAdun,"Apr 26, 2020 at 9:05 PM",2,Good Concept but ...,"This was a good concept. We play Beat Saber and BoxVR so thought that this would be good to try. 

- The tracking and calibration seems a little off. The bat doesn’t register hits, particularly when you start turning (i.e. not facing the “front”
- The trainers are really annoying and they don’t stop talking throughout your entire workout, which really mutes the music and rhythm as well as detracts from the overall visuals and landscape
- While you are set in some beautiful locations, there is a lack of crispness and detail in the views so it comes off kind of blurry

Beat Saber and BoxVR do not have these above problems. 

For the price point, it’s definitely not worth paying $20/month."
2717,Jens Ingvarsson,"May 5, 2020 at 7:15 AM",1,Mixed feelings.,"UPDATE from 5/4/20.
I’ve tried the app for 11 days and have been working out almost daily, doing 2-3 workouts every time. While it’s great for sweating, the problem with the bad mapping of the orbs and often weird movement patterns seems to be getting worse with some of the workouts. Namely, there’s a trainer named Leanne Pedante, and her latest workouts are noticeably worse in terms of non-intuitive movements - especially transitioning from lunges to swings. So it might be that it varies from trainer to trainer. There is no way it’s feasible to transition from left lunge to right and then immediately change your feet position and squat while swinging diagonally - it’s simply ridiculous. If I’m wrong - then please make a video with one of the trainers actually showing the proper form doing one of those movements - because I’ve already almost twisted my kneecaps several times while doing the Pros Only workout. Speaking of which, I’m doing this workout pretty much every time, and if I hear one more time how Leanne went to Kendrick Lamar’s concert in LA, I’m going to flip. The fact that every other reviewer brought up the issue of the trainers constantly talking, and how there’s still no way to mute them, deserves an adjusted rating of 1 star.



Initial review:

Was really excited about this one, after seeing the trailer. 

The visual part is beautiful, clean and stylish - a great mix of amazing natural landscapes and minimalist aesthetic. 

The idea with using the trainers was probably a big hit with the game designers. Not with me though - the trainers basically never stop talking, constantly distracting you from the music and the rhythm. The first thing I tried to do is turn them off - but wow - you can only slightly lower their volume, that’s it! 
From calibrating your height to every last beat of every song - there is constant talking and talking. You almost feel a condescending tone coming from them and I felt annoyed quite a few times. 

I wish the same amount of work was put into the actual gameplay. The workouts are pretty good and exhausting, but the mapping on the spheres is pretty bad - it always felt like my controllers were low on battery - tried replacing them and nothing changed. I’m playing Beat Saber on Expert level confidently, and the orbs and bats felt somewhat weird and non-intuitive at times. 

The game crashed my headset several times, and the trainer videos froze every other time. That should be fixed asap.

The music selection in playlists was random at best. 

Overall, what I really liked is the visuals here - really helps to have the beautiful landscapes like Iceland. The minimalist aesthetic also looks great and fresh. 

What I didn’t like the most is that the game never lets you feel like a bada$$. You know the feeling in Beat Saber or BoxVr, when you’re doing a new track, and it’s tough but also really intuitive, and you somehow manage to hit the blocks perfectly, feeling entranced while the dopamine hits. Never happened here so far. You always doubt if your next orb hit will register, while the trainer just keeps doing their obligatory pre-recorded pep talk thing...

And don’t even get me started on the $19/month subscription - this is just laughable. As much as I love and support VR, this idea gets a big NO from me."
2718,Sindred,"Apr 25, 2020 at 7:06 PM",4,Constructive Criticism,"Ok. So I do like this and as someone who misses the gym, I recognize that you guys did a great job with this. I definitely feel it during this stay at home down time.

But here is my problem. This is not supposed to be a game like Best Saber. It's a work out app in VR. I consider myself good at Beat Saber but no where near great. So when the arrows come at you inches from one another in crazy directions, the app doesn't fail you for not hitting them, but I feel defeated. And this was the sunrise work out that wasn't supposed to be THAT bad. I get it. Maybe I just suck. But if there isn't an option for middle difficulty at least, then I'm never going to return to this work out and probably not return to the app. 

I feel I get a great workout with repetition, and that's a lot of what my old kickboxing classes were. But with the beat saber approach and the black and white arrows coming from different angles at once, I feel like I'm struggling more than getting a workout. 

I'd recommend a medium difficulty, where maybe every other beat is a hit but the cadence and motions remain the same. If that's even possible. Otherwise Beat Saber gets the job done just fine and I don't have to pay every month. But if you guys can make it accessible to various skill levels for what's expected in hitting the arrows, then I don't mind the price. Especially because it supplements the gym."
2719,pondfrogs,"Apr 30, 2020 at 12:28 AM",1,dissappointed,i got this for exercise and enjoyment of the settings. the gameplay is similar to beat saber where swing at the targets. the triangles that u r supposed to squat in to i found confusing. the scenes are nice but i expected to see animals or birds...something besides the  landscapes. it is free for 30 days n then $20 a month which is way too much for this. i tried it for a few days and am going to delete it. ill stick with beat saber and other active games that you dont have to pay for every month and are just as fun/good.

2722,Josh,"May 6, 2020 at 4:31 PM",2,Don't try to be Beat Saber!,"I did my second workout morning, actually second partial workout because they are challenging which is not a bad thing. 

But I was frustrated when I tried Dark Forces by Jared Rodriguez. Why do you incorporate these ultra fast segments requiring you to switch arms back and forth like you are trying out a song on Expert+ in Beat Saber? 

Supernatural is clearly not Beat Saber, it's trying to create and fill a niche VR concept like Peloton. A lot of the elements are there and at first impression I think Supernatural might pull it off. At first impression I really, really like it actually.

But you can't be both a video game and a classy, well developed workout. If I want to whip my arm side to side to catch an orbs at nearly impossible rates I already have Beat Saber for that. 

I want to get in a flow and get a great workout. I was getting that up until these super fast sections came along and busted my rhythm and just pissed me off. I totally lost my place in what was happening and couldn't get back into it. 

Keep in mind, I just clicked today's workout to get this workout. It was in the left pane for Wednesday. It can be argued that there's a place for some challenging workouts and some people may want these super quick, challenging segments that will have to whipping your arms like crazy. But I didn't ask for it, I didn't go to a menu and pick a challenge. I didn't get so much as a ""How do you do?"" before this game started railing me.

Edit: I tried this a few more times and the way they chose to manage difficulty is ridiculous. I noticed a lot of the songs say [Dynamic Difficulty] so it's entirely possible that the difficulty is scaling up automatically and far too quickly. I'm not sure, but whatever it is it's idiotic. I lose interest every time it ramps up and overewhelms me with orbs. 

These are 15 to 20 minute workouts and 5 minutes in it goes into the equivalent of Hard/Expert on Beat Saber. Every workout I tried.

The workouts need to stay easy until you complete them. Period. Then, ask the user if they want to step it up for the NEXT workout. This really isn't complicated, I can't believe the Supernatural team thought it made more sense to implement a more difficult to code Dynamic Difficulty at the risk of pissing off a user mid workout.

I'm uninstalling and unsubscribing before I'm billed."
2723,TehWez,"May 20, 2020 at 7:11 AM",4,Great fitness app - niche market,"I love this game, the asthetic, and the taking of the beat saber model and tailor it to fitness model.  The work outs truly have me out of breath and I'm a moderately fit 30 year old. Being able to see a trainer is super cool too, really wish they would do more with that.

I find this as an excellent addition to my workout routine, especially at the end of the day to get in an extra cardio routine. It's motivating and engaging.

I will say that the game is excellent for the intersection of people who love VR and fitness, it truly feels like it was made just for me. But I will also say that is a narrow window, once again, I truly feel like it was made JUST for me. And it's even narrower when you consider who's willing to pay $20 a month for that. That's twice my gym payment. I'm not going to knock of a star off for the pricing, but I will say something closer to $5 -$10 would have me subscribing during this mandatory home workout period.

Critiques keeping it form 5 stars;
- Sometimes the tracking is off when I hit a target just out of range of the headset. 
- a visual cue would be nice when targets are on the opposite side of your body (beat saber shows you the blocks switching from left to right in the distance as they approach)
- a calorie counter / fitness app (Google fit ,Lose It, etc) integration seems logical and needed"
2724,Nathan Typh,"May 1, 2020 at 4:15 AM",2,"Not a Beat Saber ripoff, but not as good","I learned about this game through a Facebook ad, and as a regular Beat Saber player it caught my eye. I'm not the only one who thought this was another Beat Saber ripoff, but as a rhythm game fan I felt compelled by curiosity to try it anyways. Now that I've completed the first ""pros only"" workout, I'm confident I can make a fair review.

Supernatural is not a ripoff. This game has genuine production quality. The UI is sleek and effective, the photoscanned environments look great, and I appreciate the daily content additions. This game is trying hard to be it's own thing, but the saber-slash-notes VR rhythm genre is narrow and is already satisfied by Beat Saber.

Unfortunately, the core gameplay of slashing notes simply isn't as good as Beat Saber. The notes are frustratingly difficult to hit and the levels don't flow well. The black and white notes blend into the background environment (this was really bad during the arctic level in the pros only workout). And sometimes noted are tucked behind the opaque triangles, so you don't see them until they fly past your head.

This game's fitness spin isn't enough to draw me away from Beat Saber, which is a more satisfying rhythm experience in every way. Plus Beat Saber is just as much of a workout as Supernatural (or more so, because its levels are faster and more complex), and with free mods you can track your workout all the same.

And then there's the pricing. $20 a month is nuts. That's $240 a year! Even if this game was equally good as Beat Saber, I still wouldn't buy Supernatural. Not only is Beat Saber far cheaper in the not-so-long-run, it has an active modding community that pumps out tons of quality content for free.

I do not recommend Supernatural in its current state. It does not offer enough original content to  justify its crazy high price. And its core gameplay is a complete downgrade of a superior game."

Cons: Monthy fee to high."
2726,NephalemReaper,"May 9, 2020 at 3:31 AM",2,"Just like everyone says, its too pricey","All in honesty, I loved the experience, I was hooked up in the thought I was going to actually get fit while enjoying this game, until I saw the monthly fee. I haven't ever paid for a gym because I believe they are too expensive, even with all the benefits of once a month haircut, massage, actual expensive machines and weights, and others things that they offer for that price, imagine me paying for a game, that yes, its fun, and its aware of enhancing the body with each movement, but I am not willing to pay for that amount, a month. 

I mean, in real live, the developers have to pay the assistant once to do one session,  record it, and create the game sessions with the songs, and -thousands- of people will benefit from that one session. Why not have a lower monthly fee?  How about the purchase of in game packages of 5 songs or so, instead of a monthly fee? I would pay $10 for 5 or 10 songs feeling its fair, and when I get bored of the same songs, knowing the game has actually helped, I would highly probable buy another package. This gives me the feeling of ownership, that I know if I don't buy the next package, I can still use the application. 

Harsh truth, this game motivated me to buy beat saber instead (which I ignored for a long time), still, I am actually hoping for a change in pricing of this game so I can buy.

In my opinion, its a great game, 5 stars no doubt, but the pricing is 1 star."

2728,junkDNA,"Apr 26, 2020 at 1:58 AM",2,"Could be great, but needs a lot of work","The game is a good mix of Beat Saber and Box VR, and is a good workout with nice looking scenery - when it actually works. Unfortunately there are a lot of bugs and annoying features. 

The workouts start with an unnecessary description by the trainer - I selected the workout so I already read the description and list of songs, I don't need this. The trainers also appear to be leaning forward towards you at an unnatural angle through a platform that I assume they're supposed to be standing on. Throughout the workout the trainer talks nearly constantly, ironically telling you to feel the music, which I have a hard time doing because of all the talking. Additionally, between each section of the workout there is an extremely long loading time, sometimes up to several minutes. The game would also freeze and have glitches where the trainers showed up with the menu embedded through them.

The necessary play area is also much larger than needed for most other games, so it makes it very limited where you can play.

This could be a great game/workout if the developers fixed all the bugs, offered more that a few very limited workouts and brought the monthly cost down considerably. I haven't heard of or don't like most of the songs so that is not a selling point to justify the price.

After finishing the first workout (which included an extra 10 minutes of waiting for sections of the workout to load) I got an alert that other users were requesting to follow me. Forcing users to enter their full name and then making it default to publicly display my name, profile, and workout details is a pretty serious problem in my book, so I hope that feature is removed for privacy and safety."

Literally. Add squats, lunges, natural environments and licensed music with a monthly subscription or annual option.

You could download their app and use a fitbit if you want.. .I guess. 

I do appreciate what the devs are trying, that there is a trial and liked that it incorporated some light 80s fitness vibes. Would be better if it did more of that. Coaches are actually great too, problem is that there is a VERY similar option still available at less than 50% the total cost of this app that is still actively updated. 

Played on quest but the headset is still a bit too heavy for it to be practical for workout application. Gonna pass for now."

2733,Clare Nailo,"May 2, 2020 at 9:08 PM",3,Great concept with flawed execution,"I wanted to love this app and was prepared to subscribe for $19/month if it delivered to me what it promises. While it has beautiful graphics and gets my heart rate up, it isn’t working well enough for me in its current form. My main complaint is that this app does not reliably induce a flow state – unlike, say, Beat Saber, SynthRiders, or Pistol Whip. I LOVE the idea of an app that dynamically adjusts difficulty to keep me at the edge of my comfort zone. However, the dynamic adjustment of Supernatural does not work very well for me; it spends way too much time in the “so difficult it’s frustrating” zone. The maps seem overly complex for the kind of workout it’s guiding me through. 

I would much rather if the difficulty/complexity started out very low and slowly ramped up – something I can easily achieve in Beat Saber by manually choosing difficulty level and modifiers. If Supernatural allowed manual adjustment of difficulty and tweaking with modifers in the way Beat Saber does, it would probably be much more appealing to me. 

I also wish I could turn off the voiceover of the fitness instructors. Sometimes I enjoy hearing their instructions, and other times I would like to just concentrate on the workout as guided by the structure of the game itself. However you can only reduce the volume of the voiceover to 50%. 

It’s possible that Supernatural will evolve into an app I would find appealing and worth $19/month (or that someone else will create a fitness app that actually delivers on what this promises. As it is I would spend maybe $5/month on it at most. 

All that said, I would encourage anyone to give this a try for the free month and decide if it’s worth it for you. The concept behind it is great, the visuals are gorgeous, and it will give you an intense workout. The execution doesn’t work well for me, but your mileage may vary."

However, a couple of constructive thoughts.
First, the monthly pricing is a bit high for was is really just a game. A full gym membership would be more affordable. Although, if there were the option to have multiple profiles with one paid membership it would be more bearable.
Second, it would be really great if there were a way to modify the intensity level of the workouts; either by a manual selection of difficulty or dynamically with how well you're doing."

2737,Joe,"May 21, 2020 at 2:20 AM",1,"Not for gamers, for exercise class users","First the good:. The app gives you a free trial so you can see if it is for you. Also, I think it will give a decent workout, so if you want an exercise class app, this is for you.

On the other hand, if you are a gamer like me, looking for an app that provides exercise as a bonus, this is not it.

The bad:. This is supposed to be so fun you don't notice it being a workout. As a gamer, I consider that goal an epic fail.  First, I did not find the interface intuitive at all, and the ""adaptive"" feature that is supposed to speed up or slow things down to match your was not noticeable.  It came across more like a mind problem for me than a fun workout as you have to really think about what the various symbols want you to do. Definitely not intuitive like Beat Saber.  I got so frustrated trying to figure out how I was supposed to move that I just gave up the first time I tried it.  Other reviewers have stated they thought it was fun which is what drew me in.,  Fun is not what I would call my experience.  After giving it a second try, I realized part of my problem is I have never been in a workout class in my life, so I had no idea what a side lunge is, and that is a big part of the app.  I did do a tiny bit better the second night, but once things sped up I couldn't help thinking of it as a pale imitation of Beat Saber.  In fact, both times I tried this app I ended up doing Beat Saber for a half hour afterwards so I could have some FUN exercise  In my opinion, this app totally failed at the supposed purpose of making a workout fun. It is a workout, but it wasn't fun.  Also, if today's top 40 music is not your cup of tea, you're out of luck. Some ability to change music to fit varying tastes would be nice. Hard for me to get excited about a workout to songs I really don't like.  Please note that the primary claim for behind price is so they can have access two lots of night new none of which I personally like.  So like just about everybody else who reviewed the game oh, the price point doesn't work for me. If you are 18 you may feel differently.  

I don't do exercise classes at all. So, if you are looking for a substitute for exercise class, this review may not be applicable to you.  One last thing, supposedly, one gets an email link once you sign up to get a free sweat free cover for your Quest.  The site even mentions you are free to keep it just for trying the app... Except I never got an email with my link for the free item. Not a big deal to me as I already canceled, but broken promises right from the start are typically a good predictor of what kind of support to expect from this exercise app (please do not think of it as a game).  After reading some absolutely glowing reviews for this app that really build it up I was incredibly disappointed in it. My guess is that those who like exercise class might be the ones who think this is fun but if you like to play games and like to get some exercise without that being the only point, this is not for you."
2738,Brad,"Apr 30, 2020 at 8:42 PM",3,"Good and Sweaty, but...","I want to love this ""game"". It's like Beat Saber, where when you really get swinging you sweat a lot. Unlike BS, it just doesn't seem to do it right.

What I like:
- The coaching is great! I love the fact they'r in your ear encouraging, and reminding you to breath, and strike harder (I doubt it has any real correlation though)
- The music is not my style, but is appropriate for the atmosphere and does what it needs to. Truthfully better than a lot of the generic EDM in BS.
- The visuals are great. Love the backgrounds, they make it feel open and big.
- It really does make you sweat and get a great cardio workout. I think I might try some wrist weights soon.
- Option to demo it to another person. Great idea, especially when it's (sort of) customized to you.

What I don't like:
- Like one of the other reviewers said. The mapping is pretty bad. They're all over the place. Some spheres are tuned ok to the song, but then you have some that are almost impossible to hit coming from the previous ones.
- There is either a lot of processing lag, or something is off with the timing. Again like the other reviewer, a lot of my swings aren't connecting even though I know I'm on it. You can even see it during gameplay. My arm swings, and the bat lags behind. That's a dealbreaker to me.
- I would like to see some customization. I'd like to be able to change the sphere colors to something that my brain is more accustomed to swinging at (Red & Blue)
- I wish there was a difficulty level option. Maybe I'm missing it, but all I've seen is Varying Difficulty. That does not help me for my current mood.
- The price is way too high. I understand there's a lot of work in the background, and you're paying trainers and licensing for music. But $19 p/m is more than my gym membership. That's just plain crazy!

At this point with these issues (especially mapping and tracking), I don't think I'll be continuing after the 30 days."

You could most likely get close to the exact same thing from beatsaber and it's only one payment.

I did 3 workouts and I lost my connection to the white bat only once but quickly corrected itself.   I do still have issues with balloons not reacting when I hit so not sure if it is calibration thing or still same old glitch problem.  I will continue to monitor to see how it goes and hopefully up the stars because I really do enjoy the workout part of it so have high hopes.  It's the competitive part of the app (ie accuracy and power) that has me on pause.  Stay tuned!


 I was absolutely loving this app! The workout was amazing and Used it everyday but After a while I just could not handle the glitches anymore.  As my friend list grew I got more and more competitive and losing points because my white bat decides to float out of no where, black bat momentarily disappears or suddenly swiping the balloons but they wouldn’t pop made me so mad that I started to cry and just canceled and deactivated my account even though I had it for free til May 25th.

For whatever reason, that experience made me feel sad and empty. The tutorial for this game brought me back to that feeling. While I know that some people (usually young adults with high incomes) like this sort of workout experience, it is absolutely cringeworthy for me. Working out for me is either pounding weights, running, or more recently playing Thrill of the Fight or Pistol Whip. This app and type of workout experience was 100% not made for me, and I suspect, not made for the main demographic which has an Oculus Quest (given the initial reviews). Nice try, but I either want to be tricked into exercising with a super fun game, or just go do the old fashioned thing. I can not recommend this to anyone although I suspect once the Peloton crowd eventually gets into VR, they’ll like this."
2742,lillyfield,"May 19, 2020 at 10:22 PM",2,"Cool concept, but lacking content","I like how intense the workout is, especially with the squatting, but there is a steep learning curve. The coordination between the hands goes from simple to hard with a 360 rotation you cannot opt out of. Add to this no speed control and lack of short song/workouts to ramp a user up *and* a monthly subscription seems a bit much. I get that there are more humans making the workouts, but I think this might be better as a freemium app; there are simple basic levels that are free with the option to either purchase a monthly unlimited or a pay per workout scheme.

The tethered app bull. It gives an overview when you want to drill down."

I'm not a big fan of beastsaber in 360, so I really didn't enjoy the 360-degree rotation aspect of Supernatural. I prefer everything coming at me straight on. The monthly subscription price is not unreasonable if you plan to submerge yourself in this program. Having said that, I think this app would be much more successful if they charged $0.99, or a $1.99 per lesson. People could purchase what they want and keep it forever. I think they would probably make more money and keep people interested in the app if they could purchase individual workout sessions rather than having to pay a very high monthly subscription. $20 per month is what most people will pay for a game. For me, I lost interest 10 minutes in, and then played pistol whip and beat saber for an hour and a half. I felt like I got a better workout with those two programs because I typically play most songs in expert mode and I stay away from from the 360-degree songs because I don't like them. I think this is a really good product, it's just not for me. I wish the developer lots of luck!"

That said I won't be renewing after the trial because the trainers make me want to rip the headset off. I very much want to see an option where you can pick a workout but have them never appear or hear their audio. I don't want someone yelling at me about how this is their favorite song over and over again. Honestly the feedback is limited to encouragement because they can't actually see you and help you with form, etc. I'm not a huge fan of the music either but that's personal and I'm not a top 40 radio type of guy. Nothing personal against the trainers, they seem like nice people. but I'm an introvert and you are way too much in my personal space.

In a perfect world I would love to see a version that removes the licensed songs and the trainers (I assume this is their biggest running expenses) for a lower monthly price. The sweet spot using this app for me has been to shut off the audio completely and use my bluetooth headphones to exercise to my own music.

2747,Tad,"May 15, 2020 at 9:02 AM",3,"Interesting concept, fundamental issues","The idea of combining rhythmic slashing, squatting, and 360 motion to music sounds wonderful.  Add beautiful backgrounds, heart monitoring tracking (app and monitor required), and coaching should make this an unbeatable concept.... However....

1.  The content right now is lacking - one workout added per day.  With a monthly/yearly subscription, the price is steep
2.  The music taste for the workout is not for everyone.  Each workout has a “theme” with the music - so, if you do not like the music, you will not like the workout.  (Suggestion, same workout but customize genre of music).
3.  The tracking is off.  How the game registers hits are off at times, especially the corners (upper right for example).  Like others, hard to tell how well targets are hit.  I think the diagonal direction targets are slightly misaligned 
4.  The backgrounds are really static.  Some animation to the water, but it quickly becomes “cartoonish” and some locations the color is over saturated or blurry.
5.  The targets pattern are not combined very well.  There are times when I turn sideways all I see are black/white targets all over.  Easy to get out of rhythm- do instead of deliberate motions, it becomes haphazard.
6.  No way to practice the routine.  For one, I would not mind being able to slow it down to get a better idea what the pattern is.  That way, when trying again - I could concentrate on the moves.  Hard levels would frustrate beginners very easily.
7.  The moves are very repetitive- slashing and squatting.  Fun for a bit, but then gets boring quickly.  Maybe more content or hire practiced map/pattern builders.  Not sure how the dynamic detection works at all.
8.  Glitchy - times when “portals” show up (meaning targets should come out), but nothing appears
9.  Easy to get used to the same motions - so the level of working out diminishes over time
10.  The pauses between songs are too long, would suggest option of continuous play
11.  Some locations have backgrounds that make the white targets hard to see at times.

I imagine this exercise would be fun a few times a week, but then put aside after pattern fatigue."

This game is like the devs thought about “hey how can we get recurring income from copying beat saber” and thought of this.

Rather than earning my money on *new* content this game wants to charge me $19.99 a month for the privilege of replaying old content?"
2749,Brandon,"May 15, 2020 at 9:11 AM",2,"Bugs issues, at this price?","Game is good. You get a good workout in as long as you put in the effort and will only be as good as you strive it to be. 

The reason for two stars... bugs lately have cause major loading issues. To the point where some games won’t even start... or it will just stop loading when switching to the next stage, therefore ending your workout short. Quite frustrating. I get it’s in continuous development, but if you’re going to charge a subscription fee where two months will basically pay off the entire game for most high quality games, there shouldn’t be an issue as like this. Taking off two stars for each the price and bugs, and an extra star for that reason. With the price being paid, I don’t want my workout ending short or not even be able to play it. 

I’ll renew but if the issue persists, definitely cancelling."

Don’t get me wrong, I think it would be a great workout but I’m just not into the whole swinging the bats at a ball to the beat of music. I’m not that coordinated. Another thing is the price. $19.99 
/month is just way too much. $10.00/month would be reasonable I think. I understand that it’s a totally customized experience with coaching and everything but at the end of the day, it’s a game. I’ll stick with BoxVR for now."

2754,Meiica,"May 14, 2020 at 2:21 AM",3,Good with frustrations.,"Negatives:
-1/2 star: This is subjective but as many have said it's too pricey. The cost of a gym membership is about the same or less than this, which makes its value diminished.

-1/2 star: No way to turn off 360 movement. While this may not be an issue for some, my space is limited so whenever it would have me turn and lunge I was constantly worried I would hit something that took me out of the experience.
Admittedly the 360 does provide a bit better workout it would be nice if it had a front facing only option for those limited in space.

-1/2 star: Trails (follow the colored trail with your arm) originally I thought they were neat but they ruined them by making notes of the same color randomly in the middle of the trail you are supposed to follow completely defeating the purpose of the trail.

-1/2 star: Some of the more intense workouts feel more like beat Saber on expert or expert+ while some may like that, I personally have beat Saber so don't want to be trying to do complicated patterns in this that just add to frustration and not the workout, hard should be hard because of the movement and being physically challenging not because of complicated timing of the things you hit. 

Nuetral: Tracking is decent but not as good as in beat saber, at times it didn't notice some of the faster movements but for the most part it is acceptable.

The Good:
You will sweat your butt off, and if you are looking to shed some weight..if you keep at this and eat healthy this will definitely do the trick. I Personally love lounging back and fourth for whatever reason and as long as your not concerned with with getting a perfect score like beat saber and just enjoy the work you will really enjoy the encouragement from the trainers and the music.

It has adaptive difficulties and set difficulties, the adaptive ones might feel off for you at first but should match up better the more data it has."
2755,3rdRhino,"May 14, 2020 at 2:09 AM",2,"Reasonable workout, overpriced, defects","The one good thing: It is a good workout. A better workout, in fact, then Beat Saber that it is an obvious knockoff of. It works you harder, more areas of the body, and the structure of a timed workout is useful if you are using it (as intended) for exercise.

Lots and lots of weaknesses:
1. Everyone knows it is massively overpriced, especially for what it really is. I am unlikely to pay for it after the first 30 days and I absolutely will not pay for it after the pandemic lets me get back to the gym.
2. The music sucks. I mean, some people like really sucky music, but I don't and it is annoying. The music on Beat Saber is nothing I would listen to on its own, but it is inoffensive and appropriate to the them. Supernatural's music (which I assume they are paying a lot for) outright sucks.
3. The natural backgrounds, which are part of its main gimmick, can be moderately pleasant, but also very distracting. I have some acrophobia, so the peak of a volcano is not actually where I would like to be swinging my arms around. It is stupid that they cannot personalize your landscape preferences.
4. The ""instructors"" are straight, low effort bots, and kind of annoying ones at that. If they are tailoring what they say to the individual it is not apparent, or it is at least within a very narrow range. Most of what they say is also really mind numbing self-actualization stuff. I find myself saying stfu, and fu quit a lot, even though I know they are bots.
5. Its really not personalized at all. If it were you would have more options to choose landscapes, music that doesn't suck, and perhaps bot instructors that you find less annoying.

If you want a free workout thing I would say its reasonable to try. Its not anywhere near worth the price, if it is worth paying for at all."
2756,Peacey,"Apr 24, 2020 at 7:58 PM",2,Beautiful but not worth the price.,"I was super excited when I saw this coming out for the quest. This was exactly what I was looking for. A pretty game where I get a workout while feeling like a boss. The fitness tracker was just a huge bonus.

However, that $20 usd+ tax is just way too steep for a huge amount of people. My wife compared it to the price meaning it was for ""rich white mom's"". While inappropriate and made me wince, I get her point. 

Instead of feeling like a boss I felt like I was at the gym mostly because of the coach talking all the time. I tried to ignore it but I couldn't.

The graphics were stunning and I really enjoyed what the game was trying to do... But no way for $240 a year. Like others. A one time price of 40 or even maaaaybe 50 ... But that's pushing it.

Love what you guys tried to do here. But as it currently stands, this is sadly a miss.

Guess I'll go back to pistol whip and beat saber for my workouts. :("
2757,Soleoblues,"Apr 24, 2020 at 5:25 AM",2,Where to start...,"Maybe at the beginning, because this app apparently forgot that some folks are beginners. 

I mean, dang—I play expert mode on BS on the regular, but not in 360. Would have been nice to have been able to jump in at a lower level versus just being thrown in at an advanced level. 

And the lack of haptic feedback sucks. As does the random wooshing/missed trackers — all you folks commenting on how the ones with tails are especially bad at not recognizing when they’ve been hit are spot-on. I mean, I missed some, but not that many (I assume — really hard to tell with no haptic feedback).

The tails aren’t great either—they don’t always match to where your bat should be, despite what the game claims. 

And seeing the trackers/balls/whatever they’re called on some backgrounds is surprisingly hard. 



Oh! OHHH. And that Apple Watch tracking? Sure hope you aren’t trying to run the workout app on your watch, because it’ll turn off your workout—without warning you. 

*edit: i got this part wrong—it does quit the current workout you were doing, but it creates a new one called “fitness gaming” — a heads up would have been nice, but now y’all know*



Sure hope you’re not in a competition when you find _that_ out. 

And Lordy, not a single workout below 15 minutes? Sometimes I just want to play a quick round while on break—I was seriously hoping for the ability to hop on for ten minutes and do some moving in a lovely environment—that’s not happening. 

As is? Not worth $20/mo. Not even close. This is still in beta form, very much so. 

I really wanted to recommend this. I can’t. Wait for a few updates, when they’ve done more QA."
2758,NivkePA,"Apr 28, 2020 at 9:19 AM",3,"I really want to love it, but I don’t","I am an avid BoxVR user, and I was all set to switch to this 100% as it has all the right elements (on paper) 1. Beautiful Graphics - Check; 2. Heart Rate Monitor integration - Check; 3. Fresh daily content and trainers - Check.  But it is just not satisfying and is missing something to justify my $19 a month:  A.  The hits do not feel right or satisfying, unlike BeatSaber or BoxVR, you feel completely disconnected (even something as simple as if you hit the bats together there is no haptic feedback); B. The choice of Black and White targets is a complete fail, half the time they blend with the background (especially when you get some fog on the glasses); C. The targets come too close and too fast (even at beginner) — I play Beatsaber well on expert regularly but I just find this frustrating (especially the random and overused switches between left and right (black and white) bats/targets or the trails with absolutely no haptic feedback); D. I did not see any calorie estimator — with the heart rate was hoping this would be present; and E. Did I mention it is $19 a month (discounted).

Again, I want to love this as it has all the right boxes checked— but you would be better off (and have more fun) playing Beatsaber for 20 minutes and then 30+minutes of Box VR.   It may not be as polished, but it is more satisfying and you sweat all the same.

Clearly they really tried to make a good program, but if the Supernatural folks would just have put a little more effort into this to capture not just polish (but the spark that makes the apps I mentioned so great) it would have been a grand slam home run, but right now it is a double at best.  Please improve the flaws and you will have a customer!"
2759,Vaelis,"Apr 28, 2020 at 6:27 PM",3,Not for tall players,"I really like the concept of this app, but it doesn’t seem to be tuned for 5’10 and above with longer arms (or beginners of this height).  The balloons come at you too fast for you to have long, powerful movements with follow through, so you have to either choose to do small movements with just your wrists for accuracy or choose to miss blocks and therefore not get the full workout. With better difficulty scaling or height adjustment this wouldn’t be a problem."
2760,Adam,"Apr 27, 2020 at 12:48 AM",4,Peloton for nerds,"This game intrigues me. 

First off, it’s a *great* workout. I’ve played quite a few rhythm-based games that could be considered moderate exercise (Beat Saber, Pistol Whip, BoxVR) and this game kicked my butt. 

Contrary to most other games of the genre, it makes full use of a 360 degree space. This feels like it encourages you to think about where your feet are at all times and reminds you to engage your whole body. 

I could see how the voice of the trainer could be off-putting for some,but I found it to be encouraging when my energy was flagging, and there is a real emphasis on mindfulness and positivity that I found refreshing.

I’m eager to see how this game continues to develop in coming weeks."
2761,Scarepro,"May 13, 2020 at 5:57 AM",3,Just one flaw,"As a 44 year old power athlete and ex- functional fitness trainer, I really respect the design, execution and polish of the concept. The yearly membership price is completely fair given the model and constant content feed. I'm generally a ""pick heavy things up and move/push them around"" guy, and steady state cardio activities bore the hell out of me, so the Quest has given me several great options to keep me engaged while pushing cardio... Supernatural is now at the top of the list. The movements flow well, music is appropriately curated, and you are rewarded for speed and follow-through (unlike BS, Synthriders, etc), and you move your body a LOT in the 360 degree space.
So why not 5 stars? One glaring issue that has been mentioned before and one area of improvement that can make this even more next-level:
Give us the option to turn OFF the trainer voices during workouts. Period. I know I can turn them DOWN, but let us turn them off. Some people like them, I get it- it's a primary sell point that sets the product apart. But for those of us who just want to fall in the zone without the distraction, it's a dealbreaker. I will GLADLY pay the yearly subscription fee if I can just choose when and whether to hear trainer voices. 
Point of improvement- allow for adjustable play area size. In other physical rhythm games, this is an easy way to make people need to sidestep and get more lateral movement to hit targets etc. Speaking of which, some simple side-to-side obstacles like every other similar game has would make for fun flow variations (as opposed to them all essentially requiring some lunge/squat)
You're almost there. Full 0-100 control on that trainer audio slider and I'll revise to 5 stars.

PS why does it sometimes seem to take a full 2+ min for the game to log in and pull up menu after clicking profile name? Some sort of status/connection message there would be great, because I thought the game was just hanging/freezing the first 10 times I tried to get in..."
2762,Seige,"May 13, 2020 at 5:04 AM",3,,"Really enjoying the premise from the high-def real-world backgrounds to the trainers to the movement structure.  I am pretty fit – workout 5+ a week, cardio, wrestle, dance, etc – and it gets me sweaty and my heart rate going.  I play Beat Saber regularly, expert only and get almost all As and Ss and still find myself challenged a bit here and there on this app (though that may be due to hit detection issues).
The dynamic difficulty seems to be working.  I started at triple plat and now get single and double plat.  Feels about right.
The hit detection needs work.  The bats are visually presented longer than it seems the hit detection reads them to be.  Plus, I’m pretty sure I’m hitting targets but not getting consistent vibration feedback – perhaps because I’m not swinging hard enough?  Either way, the combination of these two issues makes me constantly questioning that rather than focusing on movement, form, breathing, or routine.  This, imo, should not be the case for app like this.  Even if you need to make the hit detection more technically lenient, I would do so.  It feels off and distracting.
The music needs way more diversity.  What’s here is great, but what’s not here disappoints.
I don’t mind paying for a monthly sub – I’ve paid thousands to MMOs over the years – but this price is way too high.  It needs to be at least half as much.  Compared to the content/price ratio of other games, subscriptions, and apps, I cannot see how this one cost this much.  I do appreciate the free sweat guard, though!"
2763,Mermonkey,"May 13, 2020 at 4:26 PM",3,More like 2.5 stars,"1st, thank you for the liner, it is a great item & will help preserve my Quest.
Unfortunately, I really feel the following criticism is needed. 
End User Experience may be the number 1 factor that truly differentiates 1 product from another, & this is where I would focus some of your budget.
I have used SuperNatural for a few weeks now, & what started as a cool way to challenge myself & improve, is now an exercise in patience with issue after issue.
1) The heart monitor aspect sucks. I have Google Fit that works flawlessly with other heart monitor apps. I am either struggling to get it recognized by the software, it does not keep track at all when recognized, or does not take readings correctly. It is to the point that I no longer use that feature within SuperNatural, rather I use Google Fit to do so. The headache & time wasted trying to get it to work was not worth dealing with.
2) Many times when I start the software, it does not place me correctly within the designated area. The platform will appear several feet under my floor, or the placement for the room is not correct. Several times, I have to exit the software,  reset the display without any adjustment & then start again & most times it will be correct.
3) Today I started a work out, no targets, no squats, just music and the lead talking. This occurred after I had already had to restart to reset the view. The frustration from all of that has driven the energy needed to write this lengthy review. This is not how I want to increase my heart rate.
I see a lot of features lacking as well, I am sure you have plans for later releases that will include some of those.
After reading several reviews, I have to agree that your business model may be in question, and it leaves you vulnerable to competition. I get the licensing issue, but I would suggest you sell a base & then sell add ons that include those license fees. As it is, this is for to narrow of an audience to be viable.
Just my 2 cents worth. Good luck!"
2764,Radiopol,"Apr 28, 2020 at 11:45 AM",2,Only as good or less of a workout,"Looks great but doesn't offer any more of a workout than I get from other fitness apps, (no, Beat Saber is not a fitness app), and in a couple cases it is less of a workout. Why would I pay a monthly fee for an equal or lesser workout? Trainers and licensed popular music aren't enough selling points for me.

Also, the 360° rotation adds very little to the exercise level so some workouts tailored more to a unidirectional space would definitely make this program more convenient and effective in some situations (due to not having to reposition yourself cautiously in your physical space)."
2765,my name is jeff,"May 13, 2020 at 6:17 AM",2,“Dynamic” difficulty,"Please, please... I mean please! Allow me to tinker with the difficulty of these workouts even a little bit. I’m no novice to VR. Can hold my own in Beat Saber, preordered by Quest, etc., but I spend 90% of my workout frustrated and unmotivated because the difficulty is bare minimum 15% over my ability the whole time. This is ok for a Beat Saber-type game where score and accuracy and improving those things are everything, but for a game that is built principally around momentum, movement and motivation, not providing your users a little more control over their destiny feels unnecessarily prescriptive and rather smug from a development standpoint. Providing your users the ability to move and increase their heart rate while feeling good and in-control about their workout feels like a no-brainer. I’m on a free trial right now, and currently have no intention of paying for this once I’m forced to. Truthfully I have little to complain about otherwise, the app is polished and well-executed in every other way, but this “dynamic difficulty” thing needs tweaking, because it ruins an otherwise great concept. Perhaps something like choosing between an easy, medium, or hard workout? Maybe with a second parameter where you could choose intensity? Like, if I could dial in an easy, high-intensity workout, I’d be on this every day. Skill shouldn’t be a necessary component to an app that should just be trying to get their users motivated about moving."

Supernatural just added an annual subscription that now cost you roughly $13.?? a month.

Supernatural is a great VR Workout. Your surroundings and Coaches are fantastic BUT WHEN I GET TO THE PRICE. 
MY BALLS SUDDENLY DROP!

I get why a subscription might be needed but why are you asking users for a YEARLY GRAND TOTAL to pay roughly $240 a year! $19 a month seems a bit much. Even now with an Annual subscription of $13.?? a month. It'll still cost you well over $100 
(roughly $156) a year. 

For $19.99 each month. 
3 YEARS: $719.??
5 YEARS: $1,199.??

For$13 Each Month(Annual Subscription)
3 YEARS: $468
5 YEARS: $780

As you can see $13.?? over the course of 5 years still adds up to a whopping $780. I don't know who figured out the pricing but I think they better go over it again (AGAIN). 

AND FOR THAT REASON. I'M still OUT!"

Wish we could have the option of playing through individual workout segments, maybe even compile our own workouts from segments in existing workouts that we liked. But that’s an ask, not a flaw with the design as it stands. Really, the only complaint is that, at $20 per month, you lose most of the convenience of an in-home workout. At that price point, there are numerous other competitors that are cheaper and comparable in quality that I’ll be willing to explore when the trial expires."

I think the devs should consider a one-time purchase option that comes with pre-loaded core exercises, and then include add-ons for additional cost. I think daily updates are impractical because of the associated price and the fact that I would not use this as a substitution workout, but as a supplement to my exercise regimen. I do LOVE the graphics, guided workouts, and choreography and would be happy to purchase if they decide to steer away from the subscription model."

There is no time to look around you before, during, or after the workout. Maybe the user can click to start the workout once inside the environment. The environment is a big draw for me but I don’t get enough time with it. 2. Can you place in modifiers for injuries? I have knee and back injuries and the songs are all lunges and squats. So it’s painful and I know eventually I won’t show up and turn off my subscription if I associate the workout with pain. I would like to reduce or turn off the level of squats and lunges and work my way up. I also think there’s no way an average beginner could hit the volume and velocity of objects. Maybe this can be modified too and people can work their way up levels. 3. Can we have an option to turn off the trainer during song? I was sweating, but in pain, and it’s short of being fun.

Unlike beat saber but like BoxVr you don’t die when you miss a bunch so that’s good for exercise aspect. All boils down to why would anyone pay for a subscription over one time charge?

2781,Kat,"May 9, 2020 at 3:55 AM",3,Initial thoughts...The jury is still out,"Supernatural is a great title which will really get your heart rate maxed in no time.

I just signed up for the free trial and started playing some of the unlocked training sessions. Here are the issues:

There appears to be only 1 beginner level of difficulty which is clearly titled as such. However, all other trainings have no level of difficulty so I have to guess and so far have been overwhelmed by the difficulty level. Ii am sure I will improve to handle these levels - however, most other similarly styled exercise games have a level of difficulty. The user should not have to identify them by trial and error as that wastes time.

Next, there is no clear exit game option.

Next, I have a pretty mainstream heart rate tracker/smart watch (Fitbit versa) that does not have problems pairing via Bluetooth. Unfortunately I cannot pair with it in the Supernatural app. The ability to have the app paired to my HR tracking was a big motivator for me to consider the monthly cost of this. Since I cannot have my training adjust to my HR, I am not sure I will continue after the trial which is a darn shame as I did like this title. While training in Supernatural, my HR tracker has reached the peak zone very easily. So  being able to pair to the app would really help my training.

Next, if you need to calibrate, you have to hear the entire introduction part again which is a pain! There should be a condensed version of the calibration.

Finally I feel 20$ a month is really high to charge on a monthly basis. Considering the above HR tracking issue, I am not sure if it is worth keeping.

Right now, I will keep exploring the title as it is very pretty and is effective enough. I hope development worked to correct the HR tracker issue, along with the other issues and perhaps I will keep my membership!

May 8 update:
Supernatural update actually added a couple classes, 1 being a clearly labeled lower level class, and 1 clearly labeled high level class. I was pleased to see this. More beginner classes would also be great in the future.

Still, I am not able to connect my Fitbit versa to the supernatural Android app - it just will not detect it when the Fitbit is in discovery mode. I really wish this issue were addressed.

I will keep playing with my trial and add to this if any new issues or improvements are made!

Thanks!"

Maybe I just suck (I don’t think so) but it pissed me off."
2783,wasikranch,"May 9, 2020 at 1:01 AM",2,"Good concept, but not for me","Well, I tried it for a few days, and it had potential but to many things were irritating.  Let me be up front, I'm over 60 and I'm pretty self motivated so I don't need the instructor's voice at all and, at least for me, it took away from the experience.  I wrote to the developers and they told me to turn the sound down.  I tried it.  But...it bothers me to pay for something and only get a piece of it.  Also, I don't recognize any of the music because, well, as I've explained, I'm over 60 so it was hard to get motivated with any of the music.  Yes, I know, turn it down.  Again, I tried it just to get rid of both the instructors voice and the music.  I can get the same workout with a couple of other programs on the Quest and no monthly fee but, alas, the same music.  Also, when you get older you loose some coordination.  There is very little in the way of adjusting the workouts like you can on Beat saber, and work your way up.  But I loved the scenery, the concept is a good one and if they get to the point where you can eliminate the instructor, change the music for us old farts (classic rock is great) and adjust the program so you can build up speed and coordination at your own rate, I'll certainly try it out again."

Tried doing pro and found it very intense and challenging which was great! Feel like boxing could also be integrated into this alongside the beat type of workout which would make it more worth the 20 dollars as well.
Update: at first I gave this a 5/5 but after 2 weeks of playing this I am rather disappointed by the number of times the songs are recycled as well as the face that the difficulty seems to be decreasing every day. I hope this gets fixed as it currently not worth my money"
2787,Jenn,"Apr 27, 2020 at 5:05 PM",2,Just ok. Not worth 20 bucks a month.,I am an avid player of Beat Saber and Synth Riders and other movement based games. I just found this game more of a annoying chore than fun. It didn’t have very many workouts to select from and hearing the trainer’s voice while working out is more of a distraction to me than assistance. I really wanted the option to turn off the trainer and just workout to the music. The movements just added a left and right lunge to movements you already do playing other games. It had nice environments but overall it isn’t worth the investment when other games and adventures on my rift can keep my heart rate up without an annoying voiceover or subscription.
2788,Bwampo,"May 7, 2020 at 6:30 PM",2,"Great concept, terrible pricing model","To sum up Supernatural in one sentence? It's a fitness-focused Beat Saber with beautiful landscapes at twice the monthly cost of Netflix.

There is so much great potential for this game, but I'm afraid that if the pricing model isn't adjusted, it's not going to last. The music selection has been ok so far. A couple great songs and a lot of songs with general appeal to go with the high energy, challenging and fun gameplay.

With the first month being a free trial, I've integrated it into my regular exercise schedule, as it really gives you a good work out and leaves you looking forward to the next time around. 

Sadly, it will only be a part of my exercising habits for the free trial month. At $20/month, I cannot see what sets it apart from other music rhythm games that warrants this price tag.

Sure, it tracks some stats from song to song and they release a new custom 15-20min workout session every day, however it appears that there's a very limited number of songs that they use in the daily sessions, so you will hear the same one multiple times in a week.  As such, I don't know why they need to charge everyone that much per month. If I'm going to be paying to hear the virtual instructors tell me to swing harder or tighten my core, I'd much rather just pay the $30 for Beat Saber or one of the other rhythm-based fitness games.

The devs have an uphill battle to show why people should be paying $20/mo. This isn't a live, in-person fitness class of 20 people per instructor that includes the cost of equipment. This is thousands of people with a recording of an instructor and each person has to pay $500 for their own equipment.

If it was $5/month, I would have been praising this game and recommending it to everyone, and I'm sure many others would be doing the same. Hopefully they rethink their pricing model down the line or at least bring in tiered pricing."
2789,Jedi Joe,"Apr 26, 2020 at 6:19 PM",2,Nice visuals,"At first I didn’t understand the reviews that complained about missing the targets. They felt solid to me. Then about 1/2 through the first “song” a few targets did not register at all as I passed a bat right through them. I did not get the color wrong on these. They just went right through with no haptic feed back. But that is a minor issue that I’m sure they will fix soon. 
The big issue is the absolutely ridiculous price. $19.99/month! Are you kidding me?! The game might be worth $20, plus a few bucks for some dlc. But nearly $240 per year! I don’t know a game worth that and this certainly isn’t it. If the company ever stops smoking crack, and adopts a reasonable pricing strategy, I will consider giving this game another try. But until then I’ll stick with the many other fitness games available."

2794,Darken,"May 5, 2020 at 4:51 AM",4,Beautiful and fun way to exercise,"Been looking for better ways to workout when at home and wanted something that pushed me more than Box VR and Beat Saber. Supernatural combines aspects of both of these and then pushes even further. Beautiful scenery, with trainers that help keep me focused. I don't mind the monthly fee as long as the workouts are kept up to date and new music is rotated in. Only issue was my wife who is afraid of heights couldn't deal with the elevated platforms. Hopefully a grounded mode is added later."
2795,Reginald,"May 5, 2020 at 8:13 PM",2,MAKE ME FEEL GOOD PLEASE!!,"My biggest problem with this is that I constantly feel defeated midway through the first song of the workout. Not because I’m exhausted (I do CrossFit), but because the movements are not intuitive AT ALL! I also choreograph, and these movements just do not flow well. The purpose of the movement being to the music is so that your natural movement to the music helps you hit the targets. Several times I turned off the app because I got frustrated with the movement being so odd and taking me out of my groove. Every now and then on Beat Saber, you may run into part of a map that is a bit challenging, but you have the option to go and practice it over and over. However, I play Beat Saber to feel like a ninja with a sword, not workout. From a workout app, I want REPETITIVE, INTUITIVE, FULL BODY movement that makes me feel confident. And if the workout app has music that I am supposed to move to, then I want to feel like I’m dancing as well. BoxVr is very simple and I like it! Even though it’s just jabs and hooks, I still can get into a groove to the music, moving my hips and rocking to the beat.

This app can be much better. For $20 a month I should finish the workout feeling like a BEAST! I should feel like I hit almost every target, completed every squat and lunge, and worked my full body to the max. 

Not sure if this bothered anyone else but I also don’t think the controller vibrates enough when you hit the orb. I want to feel like I shattered a solid orb with a bat, not popped a balloon with a needle. I want to break something!"
2796,Zacc,"Apr 29, 2020 at 6:56 AM",2,Okay truth time,"I’ve seen enough reviews talking about the price. Yes. It’s too high. But the bigger problem to me is the presentation. The balls and directions could definitely be more intuitive. The triangles are not very well thought out. It takes a minute to realize whether or not it’s a squat or a lunge. Yes, that can be learned with time and concentration. But it should be mindless so I can just do it in one fluid movement without any question whether I’m doing the right thing. Next is the hit boxes. Dear developers, fix this first. The hit boxes are so bad I quit. I understand that hitting these balls isn’t as important as with other games with the whole workout aspect but seriously the unresponsive nature of these balls is just infuriating. Finally the music. Who cares about any of these tracks. Get some throw away tracks, it’s a workout app not a radio channel (See Box VR for reference)

TLDR: price is high. Not intuitive. Awful hit boxes. Drop the licensed music 🤦🏻‍♂️"
2797,Dalmane,"May 9, 2020 at 8:58 AM",2,"Overpriced, Inferior to Beat Saber","There's little to recommend Supernatural vs Beat Saber.  Supernatural's songs are mostly pop songs with whiney vocals and anaemic beats.  There very few exceptions to this.  The workout playlists are chosen for you.  So, I was always stuck with songs I didn't like.  The backgrounds aren't that great.   They're distracting and some of the, actually make the white balls harder to see.  I'm focusing on hitting the balls while largely ignoring the scenery.

There's no feedback during the song to tell you how much power is in your swing.  At least Beat Saber gives you a score on each hit.  It seems Supernatural  wants you to do full arm swings.  However, if you do well the balls come in patters that are impossible to hit with full arm swings.  Either you miss on purpose or you wrist flick.  Neither is fun.

Unless the Supernatural devs work behind the scenes to kill custom songs on Beat Saber, there's no reason to pay $20 a month for songs you don't want.  Personally, I think it'd be pretty despicable if the Supernatural team tried petition the legal system to remove custom Beat Saber songs.  Especially since at least one of the head devs of Supernatural was one of the best Beat Saber mappers in existence, and wouldn't have been able to develop Supernatural without the experience gained from making custom maps."
2798,Gonzalo Gil,"Apr 24, 2020 at 6:19 AM",2,"Not bad, but too pricey","Nice visuals, fun workout, but definitely not worth $20/mo, I’ll stick to beat saber. Make a non subscription version, even if it’s $40 with a couple of workouts, then subscription or song packs."
2799,Daniel,"May 3, 2020 at 8:04 PM",3,I didn't expect to like it,I honestly only tired this game because of the free Sweat guard they were giving away for the trail. I like it a lot more than I expected to but there are problems. Tracking is definitely an issue. I can play beat saber on expect and it feels good but supernatural seems to have trouble keeping up. I says I miss a lot more than I agree with. It is definitely a good work out and it is a lot of fun but I don't know if it's worth $20/month/user. It means that for me and my wife to play this game would be $40/month.  For that price I can get a membership to a real gym. I will definitely be playing though the trail but I don't know if I will continue after. They need to make it cheaper and include some type of family bundle. ￼
2800,Keven or Catherine,"May 2, 2020 at 7:49 AM",4,"Mixed result so far, a few suggestions.","I've been enjoying most of the daily workouts, but some of the song choices seriously make me pause to turn off audio and it's a very boring game muted. I'm going to stick with it for a few weeks and then determine if it's better than the box vr I've been using. Currently the game is definitely more beautiful and 1/2 the songs are better, but the odd really overplayed (lady gaga!) is full on cringe, and the one time cost vs the $240/year cost is a tough sell at that. 
Other notes:
1. It's difficult to determine if you're supposed to be rotating at waist to strike targets coming at angles or turning with your feet. That could be made clearer.
2. With all the rotating and lunging, it would be good to put an audio orientation to keep you centered in your mat. If the music were coming from an invisible speaker at center you could easier find your way back to center before lunging into your sofa.
3. The instructions are to follow the trails that sometimes appear, but sometimes those trails go past one or more balls of the same colour! Not sure what to do with those.
4. Please support Samsung gear for heart rate."
2801,Betsyg,"May 2, 2020 at 6:08 PM",4,Good but could be better,"I'm glad to know the developers are reading these reviews. I like a lot of things about this--I like the encouragement from the coaches--but as I play it I feel it could be better. I love Beat Saber and loved the fitness song Fitbeat and hoped to have an experience a little bit more like that with Supernatural. I like the song lists but the choreography is, simply put, not fun. You never get that feeling like you are dancing or grooving. I also agree that there is a bit too much of a game-like challenge in some of the courses...I'd rather see choreography that is challenging because of the fitness element--not the hand-eye coordination element. For that I will play Beat Saber! Very promising, though, and I am playing it and sweating in it every day. 

One other thing which is I think you could make better use of the coaches. The cool downs are way too short, and it wouldn't be a bad idea to have some stretches to start as well. You're paying the coaches; they should do more! 

Thanks for listening."
2802,Leeloo,"May 2, 2020 at 7:32 AM",4,Updated: Really loving it!,"Editing my original review: Now that the initial glitches seem to be fixed with an update, this game is a great workout! I’m by no means in shape. I’m a healthy weight due to a naturally good metabolism, but that’s all. The first workout was intense and I will definitely be doing more. When you add in the lunges and the power strikes, this does so much more for a workout than games like beat saber.

The only reason that I am leaving 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is no option for profiles for other household members. The ability to have profiles for different household members would be important, so that their progress does affect your stats. I know I’m not the only person that shares a headset with at least 1 other person.

Also, I received my free sweatproof liner for the headset today. It is very comfortable, slips on easily, and will definitely help cleanliness since I share my headset with someone else."

2806,Kevin Kolendo,"May 5, 2020 at 7:32 AM",3,"Interesting, but not enough to judge.","I’m a Peloton owner with a fully equipped home gym.  I’m no stranger to high priced exercise equipment, expensive hardware and monthly sub fees. This app has promise and looks like it was going for a mash-up of Peloton and Beat Saber, arguably the leaders in their respective niches.  The problem is, there just isn’t enough content to judge without subscribing.  

After a beginner’s tutorial and example workout, you can’t sample any real guided workouts without agreeing to the “free” trial.  We all know what that’s like and I’m loathe to agree to a free trial without knowing more, lest I must jump through 10 hoops to cancel if I change my mind.  These things can be like  trying to leave the mob!  So you have no idea about the quality of the instructors, numbers of environments, available music, and variety of workouts.  That’s just not going to work for me.

For $20 a month, you have to show me more steak with that sizzle.  If you have a great product, stand behind it with confidence and let it close the deal with a taste I can’t get enough of.  

On a technical perspective, it’s pretty polished but still needs some adjustments.  The balloons seem airy with somewhat wonky collision detection.  You’ll miss when you know you hit the target, which never happens in Beat Saber.  You can barely hear the sound when you hit them, only adding to the sensation you are striking air.  On Quest the resolution needs some improvement as well.  There isn’t a lot of animation going on here.  Really no excuse for that with more polished graphics already executed in other titles.  

All in all, it piqued my curiosity, but unfortunately not enough for me to take a stab at the free trial.  I could see this charging MAYBE $10/mo if the content is kept fresh, but $20 is on the high side. Maybe I’ll give it another try when it comes down in price."
2807,TXTN,"May 5, 2020 at 5:49 PM",3,"Good idea, needs refinement","I wouldn’t mind the subscription cost, but the onboarding is brutal. Takes FOREVER and if you didn’t register the first time (Most people wouldn’t if they’re just trying to explore to see if they like it), they make you go through the entire on boarding again. It’s at least 15 minutes and there’s no way to skip it. Once you finally do get to choose workouts, the descriptors are so confusing you have no idea what type of workout you’re about to get. Once that starts, you’re spending another couple minutes with the trainers talking to you. Too much trainer screen time, too much talking. Totally takes you out of the experience. I also agree with others about the hit targets aren’t quite right and the sound/feedback for hitting them is less satisfying than comparable experiences.

In the future I would like to see the on boarding and trainer cut-scenes shortened or customizable. I’m trying to get up get a quick workout in and get started for work… There’s nothing fast about this application. Let me get to the weight room and stop trying to talk to me at the front desk.

Would try again once they’ve incorporated some feedback."
2808,braaaaaad,"Apr 29, 2020 at 6:56 PM",3,My wife and I REALLY want to like this,"...but it's just infuriating and just not there yet. 

1. Tracking needs to be Improved: The tracking is off and constantly loses the bats. My wife and I are expert plus Beat Saber players and we are constantly seeing the bats fly away and just not hitting correctly.

2. Multiple Users: I want to pay the $20/month subscription cause I want to support the developers and have new content. However, in order to have my wife play, she needs her own account. I will pay the $20, I will not pay $40 a month. Please allow multiple profiles on the same headset on the same account please or we will just keep playing Beat Saber.

3. Wifi constantly lost: This is the most infuriating thing. The visuals are amazing and I love that its set outside and not in a dark room. So what better place to play than outside! However, even though my wifi says its full, this app constantly loses wifi connection outside. Why after I have logged in on wifi does it need a constant connection? The training still continues but it puts a giant WIFI not connected screen in front of me and does not go away even when wifi is reconnected. Please allow the training to continue if it loses connection. 

4. Please stop talking: When recalibrating the controllers, or really doing anything there is constant talking. Please allow us to turn off the trainers.

We want to love this game, we really do, but unless these four things are changed, I don't think I will be subscribing when my 30 days are over."
2809,Peyton,"May 3, 2020 at 7:34 PM",3,Amazing game with sub par monetization,"Had a lot of fun playing this game, makes for a great workout and has some of the best virtual environments I have seen. But I did have to cancel my subscription for two reasons. The first one is the 20 dollars a month, that’s steep especially seeing that it’s the average cost of a full game. I understand that it must have been an expensive game to make and keep supported, but I think it’s asking a bit to much for what it is. The second reason being the trainers. Why do they have to constantly be talking. It gets so annoying to hear them every step, i do think that a little interaction from the trainer can help the experience but it’s just too much. If I can leave with one thing it’s that everyone should at least give it a try, it’s not going to be the new beat saber but it might be a great way for you to get some good exercise, if your willing to pony up the 20 a month ￼"
2810,Menopocalypse,"Apr 29, 2020 at 6:21 PM",4,"The potential is there, solid start","This is a preliminary review of the actual experience in-game and not results. I'm taking advantage of the 30-day trial to see where I end up physically. 

I'm approaching Supernatural as a fitness subscription and not as a ""game"" because IMO that's its foundation. So, thinking of VR Peloton. I actually appreciate the trainers chiming in during the workouts, because  I need the encouragement. But I do wish it were of a slightly different flavor/tone - they sound like the upbeat, pushy trainers in the Peloton commercials, which seems to be a style thing, and my dream coach during these workouts would be saying things like ""I know you're thinkin' about that ice cream, and maybe you can have some later, but right now I want you to push this and smash the crap out of those orbs."" Being able to turn trainers off entirely for the session kind of defeats the purpose of the new workouts released daily, as these trainers are actually doing the same map during the recordings (pretty sure that's correct), but for the replay factor a time would probably come when you didn't want the verbal encouragement. 

The music: this is apparently a selling point here, but not for me. I recognize one of the songs (so far), would agree that one or two of those I was not familiar with are decent to work out to, but as for the rest...not my preference. And these songs come around quite a bit between workouts. I'd prefer generic rhythm/epic music with no lyrics over what I'm listening to. I am admittedly a dinosaur, and know you can't please everyone. 

Gameplay: the flow is pretty intuitive, and the difficulty is supposedly dynamic on some workouts - meaning that if you're sucking, the workout adjusts itself to your suckage. I find them challenging, almost too challenging, but I'm able to push through. Accuracy re: hitting orbs seems fluky and my accuracy in Beat Saber leads me to believe it's not simply me sucking. 

For now, continuing with daily use to assess results!"

This feature really helps to promote flexibility and range of movement more than many other fitness apps. The backgrounds are beautiful. The varied types of exercises are also really good.

Unfortunately, all that is lost because the workouts are not scaled. I'm coordinated and used to rhythm games in VR, but I got completely overwhelmed trying to track everything coming at me. Part way through my first workout I realized that I was just ignoring all the squats and lunges in order to try to keep up with the targets. I felt discouraged, quit that workout, and tried one that seemed more chill. Nope. Same experience. I then realized I had wasted 20-30 minutes and had barely raised my heart rate. 

Feeling successful is a huge part of a good workout routine. You have to nail that above everything else. I felt terrible, quit out of the app, and switched to Box VR--great workout. I just wished I had the extra 20-30 minutes back to spend exercising properly.

One of the selling points of this app is customization. There are going to be people far less coordinated and less fit than me that will a worse experience.

At this stage though, I wouldn't pay $20 month for it. Long load times in the middle of sessions between songs kill momentum. I suspect that workouts are downloaded on the fly, but this absolutely wrecks the flow when you just finish a high intensity track then have to stare at a progress bar for minutes before proceeding to the next. It would be better to have the ability to download the day's workout during the night automatically to store locally for say, a week before overwriting with the next week's workout. I've now prematurely killed a couple workouts to move to Beat Saber or Synth Riders so I can keep the energy up. I'd also like to see more fitness tracker support, considering how many people use Fitbit it seems weird to not have that as an option."
2818,Martious,"Apr 28, 2020 at 3:03 AM",3,Good Workout - Too Expensive Single User,"Well... I read all over about this app and decided to give this a shot owing to lock down. Here's a summary of my day 1 experience:

The Good:

1. The workout was good. I hit 178 BPM which I usually do in the Gym.
2. I like the scenic spots but didn't see a correlation with workout.
3. Not very tough to follow but suggestion for developer - it was tough to keep up with the direction, some indicator might help.
4. Gamification of workout is a good idea on which this app builds.

The Bad:

1. Very very limited library of workouts.
2. I do not understand why you charging 19.99 per month? Are you really competing with Gym? Let me tell you I will be out the day I get a chance; you want to get people hooked, do it reasonably so you hit critical mass and make this a feasible project. Remember most of America Gyms charge 19.99 per month. Tech has to make things appealing and cheaper for being viable.
3. Really BAD - My wife has to buy another subscription? You should allow at least two users with one subscription. Also provide an easy way to switch between users.
4. If I try to log another user in, the app logs me out completely. This means I need to open app on phone, enter code and connect again. Really irritating.

Finally 3 stars due to - subscription cost, single user, not much variety of workouts.

I will update this review as I try and learn more.

*** Update on Day 1 ***

Found a bug wherein instructor is froze on all the screens. Only way to get rid of her was to restart the app. Have pictures of app team needs.

*** Update from Day 2 ***

Tried the new workout release for Monday 27th April. Burned 180 calories in 17 min. Decent workout. But I was unable to keep up with the speed of targets to hit. I am in average fitness and somewhat active. I think the challenge is the speed of workout resulted into my form getting distorted - which can cause many health issues if I do this everyday. I hope to be wrong. App team should consider adding an option to adjust max speed. I do not believe this app monitors the correctness of form."
2819,WubWuv,"Apr 26, 2020 at 8:33 PM",4,A great experience with exercise in VR,"Being stuck inside and needing to exercise is hard if you don't have any experience/motivation. Hence I like guided workouts, but reading articles and watching Youtube videos weren't doing it for me. So I looked into getting a Quest to explore the immersive VR exercise space.

Supernatural VR: The initial experience was pretty fun in terms of premise, the trainers, and the gameplay (didn't know it was 360). Having a trainer there gave me a bit of comfort, and I actually did like the supportive talk through the session. Does it help you exercise and burn a ton in cardio? Yes! I actually look forward to the sessions each day now! I have only been using the product for 4 days, but I may continue using it past the 30 day trial if they keep up with content.

What I really liked:
-The 360 gameplay
-Environment and music choice
-Trainers in terms of education, support, and warmup/cooldowns

What I didn’t:
-Sometimes the gameplay doesn’t register hits and maybe too hard for beginners-- if I had no experience in rhythm games I would probably fail all the time. There should be a category for beginners and pro. 
-Worried about lack of content, I played 3 sessions and had two of the same songs in two of those sessions. Also one of the sessions was missing the trainer, but that was due to the lockdown.
-Promotion of the apple watch for heart rate over cheaper alternatives (found cheaper android alternatives)
-Monthly Subscription Cost

Final Thoughts:
You want to exercise and perhaps have a small escape from reality, give Supernatural VR a try! If they consistently add more songs, trainer dialogue, and features long term I think that this could be a great daily app for those  that want to exercise but are stuck inside."
2820,Emrys,"Apr 28, 2020 at 5:45 PM",2,,"I'm running into three majors issues for myself that have me strongly tempted to cancel the trial and go back to Beat Saber.

The first is the songs. The workouts have no consistency with the songs chosen for that workout. For example, some workouts seem to be a mix of pop and rap songs. That's targeting different demographics. There should be consistency in the songs chosen for a workout, and I don't mean just all pop for all rap. I mean each song should be chosen in a way that is similar to the previous song chosen. This would allow a workout to someone that likes that kind of music, without forcing them to go through songs they dislike. Then different workouts use different types of music, so people have their options on what to use. Personally, I strongly dislike rap, and I am getting tired of being forced to go through those songs.

My next issue is with the trainers. At the beginning and end for warmup/cooldown stretches, it's actually useful. You can see them and watch them going through the stretches to match them. However, during the songs, it's completely useless. At best hearing them is a cool gimmick, and at worst it gets annoying. At first I didn't mind, but listening to them every day for almost a week now has started to get annoying. They talk too much, interrupting your flow and distracting you from the songs, for no benefit at all. It's not like they can talk and give you feedback and correct your form. It's all prerecorded messages, and pointless.

My next issue is with the dynamic difficulty. In theory, it sounded great. In practice, however, it limits you from pushing yourself. I tried the one hard mode only workout available, and got such a better workout than the others because I had to move much faster to attempt to hit the targets, even if overall I was less accurate. If someone wants to push themselves, even while being less accurate, that should be their choice. Instead you are forcing them into what they are most accurate at."
2821,Joe,"May 30, 2020 at 6:31 AM",2,Poor choice of songs,Too expensive with not enough content to warrant the subscription. Buyer be warned.
2822,Shadow,"Apr 26, 2020 at 7:48 PM",1,,The app might be free but the game isn't. After the tutorial it will want you to make an account. It says you will have a free 30 day trial and than you will have to pay a certain amount per month.
2823,Coop,"Apr 27, 2020 at 10:38 AM",3,COULD be great... just not yet,"Love the visuals, like music, but I really think there’s something wrong with the tracking. It doesn’t act like I hit the targets but after the session it says I hit more than I thought which is great but it throws me off and I get frustrated. I’ve also felt some of the targets are set a little too close than they should be for the proper movement you start tangling up your arms. As for the triangles for squats and lunges, I love it. I really hope to see a lot more of it but  I just started the free 30 days so hopefully I will. As for the trainers talking, it doesn’t bother me I was a trainer so i get the idea. I just tune them out focus on music. I did spend some time cussing one out, that was relaxing lol. Lastly the price, don’t think so...sorry $19 is not something I’d be willingly to pay especially with some adjustments needed and not to give the game away but don’t you want to charge something that if somebody forgets here and there you still get paid! $19, I won’t forget about"
2824,T. Nacci,"Apr 27, 2020 at 12:05 AM",3,I’m glad there’s a free trial,"I’ve used this for a few days now and I’ll see the trial through but I have some issues with it that I would like to see before deciding to keeping it. 

I like that the workouts get you moving , sweating, breathing hard and the heart rate up. The environments and the music are both great. 

BUT...I’m finding it a bit frustrating. I appreciate the dynamic skill level but I wish that it could be set manually and you have the option to increase it when you feel ready to step it up. I have a few partial workouts because I was just flailing my arms around trying to keep up and didn’t want to injure myself with improper form and movement . Also the orbs being black and white make them blend into the background at times. an option for contrasting colors would be great. I would like see 180 option cause even with a play area that’s 7’x9’ the lunges and turning made my guardian appear too often. 

I would also would like to see fit bit added as a tracker. It’s one of more popular trackers out there. I can still track heart rate on my own but when heart rate is a feature of the game having that as an option would be nice. 

I hope that improvements are made because I like being challenged but I also want to have fun playing. Beat saber, box vr, and pistol whip do a good job of giving me a workout that is fun, challenging and allow me to slowly build up my skill level so that I’m not frustrated."
2825,Timbale,"Apr 27, 2020 at 9:29 AM",3,I really want to like this and would pay,"Man this is such a great idea!  Take Beat Saber and make it a TRUE work out game, but all this feels like is Beat Saber lock on an expert level and with a personal trainers voice in the back ground.  This should be a workout app based on actually getting you to do repeatable EASY motions to get your heart rate up and your muscles activated.  Instead there is a constant barrage of sometimes random seeming targets coming at you.  In rare moments there are some repeating patterns where you get a chance to memorize the movement and get a flow going.  This is when my heart rate goes up and I start to feel the exercise.  Unfortunately this happens rarely.  I’m not trying to get good at Beat Saber I’m trying to get a work out!  Too much game and not enough work out imo.
One thing they did get right is the triangles to get you into lunges and squats.  Those work great and always get my legs burning.
Please make at least half of the content actually focused on simple repeatable good exercise and movement instead of difficult to memorize patterns.  If you do this I will gladly pay $20 a month."
2826,Crusen,"Apr 25, 2020 at 7:54 PM",4,"A solid workout, but value is unknown...","I've been working out in Ring Fit and Beat Saber the last few months and seen really good results but after a couple days of this I'm more sore than I've been from either of those. That being said there are some issues. For one, tracking is not as good as Beat Saber. I play that on Expert/Expert+ but I'm missing notes here I know I shouldn't be. I've also had some issues with crashing.

That being said the real question long-term is value. As someone who canceled a $20/month gym membership that wasn't being used when I started doing my gaming workouts I'm not opposed to spending the money if the workouts are worlds better than others, but we'll see about that over the next few weeks. I'm enjoying it even as it destroys me so far. Hoping updates will fix tracking and stability and that workouts stay varied fun."
2827,wingardiumleviosa,"Apr 26, 2020 at 6:46 AM",3,Too expensive considering alternatives,"Loved the landscapes and the overall experience, but for me personally it’s not worth the price tag. I’m going to stick to Box VR and Beatsaber."

But for the love of god: I’m athletic, have good coordination...and find it way too hard - so discouraging I’m thinking of discontinuing. Please provide more intermediate levels that aren’t going that fast and offer some breaks to catch your breath!! I really cannot believe that an average person is able to find this rewarding."
2829,JulieWall,"Apr 30, 2020 at 2:46 AM",2,Really Disappointed ...,"I tried the tutorial the other day, then downloaded the companion app. And I was so excited to try this. I logged in, went through the tutorial again, and when that was finished? Nothing. I had to go out and come back in. I selected the Beginners Only workout and was really enjoying myself, and then after the second song? Nothing. Again. 🤦🏼‍♀️ The little bar comes up, but it doesn’t move.

I tried both of my WiFi networks and it locked up on both of them. An exercise program is supposed to help relieve stress, not cause it.

I understand this is new and some bugs need to be worked out, and I will check it out at least a few more times before the trial runs out, but unless there are some serious improvements I will cancel before the end of the trial."
2830,Ventelus,"Apr 29, 2020 at 5:00 AM",3,Supernatural Has Potential But...,"Pros

1. It gives a more intense workout than Beat Saber and Pistol Whip combined in half the time, especially on Pro. You will sweat and feel the burn better than any other VR fitness app. That part is 100% true.

2. The environments are gorgeous, and seeing all these places exist is amazing.

3. Pre-licensed pop songs with official beat maps are a godsend. The lack of them was why Beat Saber was modded so early in its life.

4. The triangle concept for squats and lunges is cool and I like it a lot more than the walls in Beat Saber or Pistol Whip.

5. Apparantly, it has really good smartwatch support for watches it supports, though I can't personally attest to that because mine's not supported.

Cons

1. The cost is unnecessary. At $25 a month my local gym gives me full access to all equipment, free form consultation, 24/7 building access, free tanning (that I don't use), and I can bring one friend free every visit. Beat Saber with every map pack costs less than what it costs to subscribe to this for just 5 months (84 vs 95 at time of writing). And apparantly thats a ""founding members"" rate? The pricing is so exorbitent and I can't understand why.

2. The Personal Trainer idea is cool in concept but terrible in practice. A personal trainer is for genuine form consultation, tips, critiques, examples, etc. Not some prerecorded motivation that can't even be turned off. The voiceovers distract from the song and, ironically, hinder the ability to truly get involved in the workout.

3. Tracking is bad. Not terrible, but not good. Hitting even remotely off center of the balls is a toss up on whether it will register or not and the lack of haptic feedback on non-power hits leaves you constantly questioning if you hit or not. I lend part of this to the fact that, for some reason, the bat is not aligned with your hand like most sword or club type objects are. They are tilted a fair bit forward and I don't understand why.

4. The triangles and tails can sometimes counterintuitively get in the way of proper form. This was most noticeable on back to back lunges where it would be almost impossible to fully extend into one lunge before having to go the other way, resulting in a movement more akin to bouncing.

5. The environments, while beautiful, basically amount to a 3D rendered photograph with some added water and rock physics. They get old after the initial awe.

Overall, this product has potential. If the tracking was improved and the cost was lowered to 9.99/m or even 12.99/m then it could be a 4 star product. Add in some quality of life improvements like aligning the bat to your hand, better haptics, and being able to turn off the coach and you'd have an exceptional product. But, in its current state, I simply cannot recommend this to someone at its full price, the quality for the cost just isn't there."
2831,bryanlo,"Apr 24, 2020 at 5:39 AM",3,Enjoyable beautiful workout .. but,"First, thank you for this wonderful fitness game. 

What if I can just pay per workout exercise only without the song as  downloadable DLC , because I don't want to pay monthly membership.   

I am happy to pay per workout exercise as download into my Quest VR . 
 Also can I just listen and play my own MP3 music instead 
while I am doing my workout exercise if possible.    
 Great fitness game for all VR owners."
2832,Witcher,"Apr 27, 2020 at 7:48 PM",3,A great alternate Beat Saber,"So... it's Beat Saber. Let's not pretend this is something other than Beat Saber so we can get right to the other stuff. I really LOVE the graphics. They are just amazing and it's one of the better looking Quest games out there. I like the feeling of working out in a place that makes you want to take a deep breath. I like the music. It's not stuff I'd likely listen to outside of the game, but in the game it's spot on. I like the way the coaches are portrayed. They sort of follow you when you move side to side- like they project as if they're always looking at you- and they seem life size. So I like that. As far as the game goes- I like the way the lunges work and the squats and core turns- I even like the graphics for the orbs you have to hit.
What I didn't like. I don't think the hit detection is up to snuff. I'm a very experienced Beat Saber player and I got a lot of hits marked as misses and that distracted from the game for me. It's not exactly as easy to see which color you're supposed to be hitting because of the glare on the shiny part of the 'directional bubble' casing on top of the orbs.
And the big issue for me- the subscription based service. It's absurdly overpriced. $20 a month is out of sync with the market. $3-$5 maybe. And even that would likely be canceled after a few months. Make this a $30 price tag- flat- and I'll come back. Honestly. But at this rate- I'll use it for 30 days and I'll enjoy it- but subscription based services that can potentially rack up that sort of price isn't realistic today. Not when games like Box VR or Beat Saber are flat fees and do very, very similar gameplay experiences. 
Unless there are major- MAJOR game changes coming soon- like totally different game options- this will be a flawed experiment and that's a shame as I really do like the idea of the environments."

The only thing stopping me from loving this is that the colors are locked as black and white.
