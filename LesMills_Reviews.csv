0,Alexvs,Mar 1 at 10:57 AM,5,Bought for the wife but now I'm hooked!,"I originally bought this for my wife as she used to do Les Mills with a friend as part of their workouts and loved it. It actually made her go from Quest hater to lover and after a few weeks of this and her new diet, she's started seeing the weight loss already.

Obviously I had to test it out for myself and boy did I feel it the next day! I'm now a convert too! It's amazing that there's no subscription and they've added new workouts as part of their updates.

1,Ben2011,16 days ago,5,Great Workouts,"Got this about a month ago and it's really awesome. You really get a great workout with this app, afterward you're sweating good. Best of all you get the full game, no in game purchases or subscription. If you want to sweat and lose weight and get fit, this is the app to get. No gym needed, just make room in your house and get to working out, I enjoy this app."
2,Doneus,Mar 16 at 11:30 PM,5,Just what I needed!,"Hey folks listen up... I'm 61 years old (so peer pressure doesn't have much effect), I'm 275 lb after losing 30 recently (so you can see I'm not easily motivated to exercise) but I am finding this program inspirational! I'm not sure what it is but I actually enjoy doing the workouts. This is something I haven't been able to say for 45 years. I'm not sure if it is the real person trainers that talk you through it or the leaderboard that strikes a chord with my competitive nature but it just works. And please don't think if a 61-year-old 275 lb dude can do it that it's too easy. It is not! Please give it a try you will not regret it."
3,Kirbo,16 days ago,5,Great way to supplement your workouts,"Les Mills BodyCombat is not a game at all, it’s a workout regiment that makes use of your upper and lower body. You’re not just flailing around but doing actual body movements that are designed to raise your heart rate and burn body fat.

I use it exclusively after every gym session where I lift weights and do light cardio on the treadmill. Once I get home the real cardio starts.

There’s different levels of intensities and workouts you can choose from that range from a quick 5 minute sweat to a 20 minute endurance. 

I believe this is what VR should be more about, Les Mills definitely hit the target with this app and I recommend it to anyone who wants to supplement their current workout regiments or wanting to get into a more active lifestyle."

After a few weeks of doing intermediate workouts I started doing “Advanced”. With making better food choices and doing 45 minutes of advanced workouts per day, I lost 25 pounds so far in just over 2.5 months. At my metrics, 45 minutes of advanced in over 800 calories burned. The commentary gets a little repetitive but I’m in it to workout and lose weight, not enjoy the commentary. Highly recommend this app.

5,HolmesJD,19 days ago,5,One of the best workout games,"Thank you, thank you, thank you for not making this a subscription game!  This game is far better than other games that you might find similar in nature.  I love the knee strikes, the varied direction of punches (up, down, in, out, straight), and the body mechanics for slips are great!  You get a full body workout and you will need to pause to wipe the sweat from your eyes and headset!  The coaching is fun and I appreciate that it isn't repetitive phrases.  There is a great variety of difficulties and length of workouts to fit your mood or fitness level."
6,Susan,Mar 5 at 8:06 PM,5,Excellent workout,"I asked for the oculus for my 51st.  birthday because I get bored easily with exercise. I personally need lot of work to get back in shape, and also for my wellbeing. I found this app and I can go at my own pace and options for changing the workouts. I don’t have to clutter my home with workout equipment or a gym membership that I will not use. When using this app I feel that I have been working out. It’s a good workout for me and it can be tuned to fit you. I give it five stars because it drives me to want to work out. It’s instructional, motivating and encourages you to keep going."
7,David,Mar 12 at 2:00 PM,5,"Great workout app, worth every euro!","This is an awesome game. It is a great work-out with three different levels of difficulty and a lot of great moves to master. 

If have some knee problems and with LMBC you can focus on upper body workouts if you want, which are indicated as such in the app. 

The tutorials are also to-the-point and very helpfull to achieve better results.

Two thing on my wishlist: 

1. co-op mode, a way play a  workout together with a friend
2. keep it a non subscription app please (even DLC is better)

Keep up the good work."
8,RnB,Mar 9 at 11:41 PM,5,Well-rounded workouts (25% off),"I used Supernatural for a month when it first released. I've been using FitXR for the past 90 days. I think those are both good apps.

Now I picked up Les Mills and am finding that I prefer these workouts. It's quite similar to boxing in FitXR, but requires more of your body. I'm a fan of coaches working with you through the workout, so for me these coaches are great. They are constantly pushing you and providing tips. This app doesn't care much about the music. 

Using my Garmin watch, I've found that I burn calories at the same rate as advanced boxing levels on FitXR. But I also feel like I'm working more muscle groups.

Remember you can refund before 2 hours playing and 2 weeks owning (few times per month). Hope this helps!

REVIEW:

I don't keep games unless I know I will play them often. This one is an obvious keeper because it is a very good work out. 

Exercise-wise it feels like a combination of Pistol Whip (legs) and Thrill of the Fight afterward. I enjoy chasing the leader and feel good when I do well, so that's a real motivator.. I like those moments when the leader clearly runs out of energy and just crashes (except when it's me!).

The downside is you can do it lazy -- the ai can only kinda watch you, so this is a hardware limitation -- but generally if your form is good and you try harder your score will be higher. It's up to you. They do give helpful reminders as you go, and sometimes these hints are surprisingly well timed with when I get sloppy. Yesterday she said ""Well that wasn't pretty remember to keep that elbow up ... There, good!"" So at least there is some attention to what your hands are doing in real time. 

Music-wise I mostly don't notice the tunes except that they are there and not invasive. Usually some epic type of movie-like soundtrack that gives the right tempo for the workout. Importantly, all the hits are well timed with the music, unlike all the other target boxing games I have played.

Anyway, enough said. My butt is sore."
10,Mom,Jan 18 at 6:05 AM,5,Great investment,"1. Only a one time extremely low fee compared to supernatural that charges the same fee per month
2. Have been using for a month now and at first I thought easy was hard but I’m now progressing onto intermediate
3. Levels are challenging I have to stop after 2 sessions as I’m so out of breath and sweaty! 
4. Really like the coaches that give you guidance for your form to engage your muscles to get more out of your workout 
5. Working out doesn’t feel like working out I could do everyday
6. Leader board makes you want to do better. I’m trying to beat a certain someone that always happens to be on when I’m on
7. Like that it tracks your past progress"
11,Bob Welshon,5 days ago,4,Please shut up for a second,"Don't get me wrong, I like this app, but could the instructors keep quiet for just a few seconds? I wish there was a setting to tell the app how much instructor feedback you want, something like (Minimal, Moderate, Maximum). I'm near the point where I want to turn the sound down completely, but then you would miss out on other sounds, like hitting targets.
Oh, and after a month of owning this game, the dialog becomes obviously repetitive.
Still, I like it, it gets me up and going, just needs a few tweaks."
12,Gill,Feb 18 at 10:03 PM,5,Best purchase i ever ever made,"So here me out. I hate the gym, going to classes and im sticking at nothing. I bought meta quest on a whim hoping id get fit. Knowing i wouldnt. This app has changed all of that. Its engaging, challenging but fun. It records calories, workouts and time spent. That really helps me see how much i am achieving and i love there is such a different choice of classes some just a couple of minutes which i know even on a low day i can do and get it over with. 

Hands down the best fitness app i have ever used. You wont regret it.

14,Bruce W.,25 days ago,5,This is the best fitness app!,"This fitness app is great at motivating and inspiring you to keep challenging yourself.  

It has a large selection of content and variety ￼to keep you excited and engaged in your workouts.  I’ve been playing for two weeks straight so far and I still haven’t reached the intermediate level yet, which appears to be packed with content as well, not to mention the advanced levels.

What is also terrific about this game is that once you purchase it you will own it and be able to play as little or as much as you like.  Unlike the other subscription based fitness apps, which do not allow you to own the contains you end up paying much more for much less.

17,Marva,6 days ago,5,Les Mills,I am a person that did little or no exercise on a weekly basis. Since logging onto this in the VR I am in this almost daily. I thoroughly enjoy thinking that I am learning to box but get pleasure in the fact that I am having fun and moving more. I have a long way to go but at least I am doing more than what I have ever done.
18,Nick,23 days ago,5,Les Mills rocks,"I played to sets totalling 10 minutes and my muscles ache now. Music is good,voiceovers nice, leadboards interesting. Graphics are great,no subscription which is excellent in today's climate. Bought this in sale for 13.49 and it's absolutely worth it.

20,ChubbiChibbai,10 days ago,5,The best fitness app for Quest.,"Tried a bunch of fitness apps. This really is the best hands down....or should I say gloves up. 

No subscription. Most the others want you to play monthly. This is pay once and you are good to go. They do update from time to time as well. 

The coaching is fantastic. The form cues respond to your movement and it works. 

The workouts vary from easy to very intense. The sessions are incredibly fun and rewarding and it's the closest I've found to hiring a trainer to hold some pass and yell combos at you. It's pretty much on par. 

If they released paid expansion packs I would willingly pay. It's really that good."
21,Joey,10 days ago,5,Amazing app,"I subscribed to les mills on demand during Covid and bodycombat has been one of my favourites.
I was wishing back then for something like this to be developed and I was over the moon when I saw this. It’s always more fun to have something to hit (esp when you had a bad day) than punching air. This app had me drenched in perspiration just 20mins and I believed I had lost some weight doing it and given that Rachel and Dan were my favourite instructors from lesmills, having them on app is a bonus. Now I’m hoping for something to be developed for the trip from lesmills. Money worth spending if you’re seriously looking to lose some weight and gain an edge on your fitness level!"
22,Sandra,10 days ago,5,Great workout every time!,Thank you developers and fitness team. I’ve enjoyed the workouts tremendously. Some of the same talk can be monotonous but still a great experience! I’m a 59 year old overweight female and after a couple of short workouts or one long and one short. I’m dripping sweat but not winded. Just a really good workout  I haven’t surpassed the beginner stuff but I will. Thanks again.
23,Alan Blain,11 days ago,5,Les Mills Gives You A Great Workout,"I got hooked on SuperNatrual Exercise App using my Oculus Quest 2 Goggles. What so great about SuperNatural is it’s simply a lot of fun and they have great music. I then purchased the Les Mills exercise app and I gotta say it can kick your butt. There are many times I’m left gasping for air.

IMO the two apps compliment each other. For fun and some good exercise I use SuperNatural. To take my fitness goals to a higher level is where Les Mills comes in. On an average days I lift weights for 30 - 40 minutes shooting to hit every body part at least once per week. Those body parts include chest, biceps, triceps, back, shoulders and legs.

For cardio I usually exercise for 60 minutes per day doing the Elliptical, SuperNatrual and Les Mills. The one thing I don’t like about LM is it takes forever to load and the trainers spend too much time popping in and out of the exercises."
24,Alfred,17 days ago,1,Les Mills Bodycombat - Compete Failurel,"STILL NO RESPONSE.... I have reset the device and reinstalled it... I turned on Mic Access as required... it worked twice and I am still getting no response...nor am I eligible for a refund.  TERRIBLE SERVICE.. :(  #stillwaiting


The game only worked twice, and now it’s stuck on the Loading Screen…. Every time.  I’ve been working with Daniel at Odderslab… have performed multipl￼e reinstalls and even a factory reset. Still nothing. 

I just want it to work after paying $29.99… and now I’m ineligible for a refund. Would love someone to contact me but I’ve received ZERO response back as of yet.  Sucks :("
25,Debs,14 days ago,5,Just starting my weight loss journey,"Best £13.99 I ever spent. Along with my calorie controlled diet, I believe this is the answer to getting where I want to be. Not only is it fun, I've worked up a real sweat by the end of it. Yeh the commentary can be abit annoying and repetitive but it is needed as there is constant reminders to get those knees bent and to hit harder etc. Really good to spur you on when getting weary. I thought Audio Trip and Beat Saber were a good workout but this is another level. If I had played a demo version, I would have paid the £22.99 for it as worth every penny so I think I got a real bargain. I can't recommend it enough. I truly believe this is going to help me. Watch this space..... .."
26,SquirrelForce,Feb 27 at 9:39 AM,5,Now THIS is a Workout,"This game will knock the unhealthy out of you (if you're consistent). I recommend you play this game with an adequate amount of space so you don't hurt yourself or damage any of your belongings because YOU WILL MOVE! My only minor gripe with this game is the targets that require you to use your knee to hit them, it can be a little finicky, but it doesn't really take away from your overall workout. I highly recommend this game if you're looking to excersize while having fun."
27,crabby,20 days ago,5,Annoyingly good!,Was one of those things where I figured I'd try it with the expectation that I'd fall out of it straight away... But I must admit it's left me rather a lot more motivated than I expected and although I am aching I am looking forward to my next workout!
28,Djtheman,13 days ago,5,Umm Drenched!!,Ok. Ok. So I looooved Supernatural but this is a BEAST. No monthly subscription and I’m drenched when I’m done. That’s the whole point right?!!  Incredible workouts and I tried it to get more leg work since Supernatural was lacking in the department. Be careful what you ask for. WHEW!!
29,RaynMan,Jan 21 at 3:32 AM,5,"So close, so far","I love this app. I use it every morning before going to work. I give it 7 out of 5 stars.
I highly recommend this game. It's an extremely good workout and it's fun. It's also not subscription based, yet it's still updated frequently.
However, could you please, please, please have Rachel shut up with the ""So close, so far?"" It's extremely annoying. There's no need to say anything at all. 
Wish list: Is it possible to add workouts that focus on certain things like hooks, or uppercuts, etc. It would be just for practice. Maybe 50%-70% dedicated to to that task. Example: I'm at level 25, yet I'm still not good at hooks. It would be nice to have a practice module dedicated just to hooks (or whatever a user chooses) in order to fine tune their skills in that area. If there's a workout that requires a lot of hooks, not only do I have to hear that annoying ""bong"" when I miss a target, but I also have to hear Rachel tell me how bad I suck even though I had a great workout,  I burned a lot of calories, increased my strength and my heart rate was way up."
30,Me,Jan 3 at 11:09 PM,5,Different from supernatural,"I did supernatural for a free trial. I liked the music and had fun with the hard level of boxing. That felt like a joy ride in comparison to the hard levels of bodycombat. bodycombat got my heart pumping better. Way better full body workout. I liked the feature of the score keeping and leaderboard during the workouts. You get more points for hard hits, not just hitting the targets, so I find I really give it my all. The trainers also make you feel like they are coaching you the whole way. I like the feature where it tells you how you have done the last time you did a track. I will miss the views, natural flow of supernatural, and music but you can’t beat a no subscription, good quality exercise app like this one.  $19 one time (on sale) bs $179 a year for super natural. I think I found the winner in Les Mills."
31,Yuray14,Mar 3 at 5:33 AM,5,One of the best VR fitness app out there,"I bought this 2 months ago due to a recommendation from a friend who lost significant weight with this app. I’ve played many VR apps before that keeps you moving but this one makes me sweat a lot. It’s on par with Thrill of the Fight in terms of intensity but what I like about this is you have coaches who really guide you on how to do bodycombat. After 2 months of diet, exercise, and playing this app, I already lost 20 lbs and my stamina has improved greatly. 

Some improvements I hope to see in the future to keeps things fresh
- 1v1 multiplayer. It would be fun to compete against a random player and see his/her avatar playing the same workout. 
- Use of popular music. I wouldn’t mind paying for dlc content if you can do bodycombat with your favorite music. Just don’t make it subscription based. Similar to beat saber it can be a one time fee for each downloadable content."
32,Tosin,Dec 20 at 12:11 PM,5,Get it if you want to destroy fat!,"Omg! I was not expecting how awesome this app would be. It is a great, fun workout and it really gets my heart pumping. I honestly didn't think VR exercising would be effective, but since I've started using this, I'm dropping inches everywhere. I've also noticed an increase in strength. The best part is, it's so much fun that I look forward to working out with it. Just be careful not to overtrain. It's pretty addictive so it can be hard to stop, but I force myself not to use this everyday.

Only negative comments I have is those knees hits. It's almost impossible to get them. I hope this can be improved with a better design for these hits, or better training on this move."
33,Kathy Christian,Mar 16 at 7:33 PM,4,I’m Hooked!,I absolutely love this game! It has been a game changer for me. I am up at 4:30 am to workout before work. This sets my day just like making my bed. My day feels incomplete if I have to miss. I have seen such a difference and feel amazing! At 55 yrs old it seems silly to say that while at work all I can think about is coming home and hitting Body Combat by Les Mills. 😊🙌💯❤️💪
34,David Kelly,19 days ago,5,Fun and very effective,"I am 48 years old and was extremely unfit. When I started playing this game I could barely get through a 6 minute light intensity level. Now I'm doing 40+ minutes of advanced intensity in the morning and am in the best shape I have been for years.  The workout is so much fun I look forward to my morning jabs, hooks and knee smashes.

I tried other fitness apps but they just don't compare. This is great!"
35,Emma Phillips,18 days ago,5,Great workout,"I’m not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn’t expect to sweat as much!! 
Lots of workouts to choose from ranging from 5 to 20 mins. The trainers are super motivating and the leader boards definitely give you a competitive edge and make you work even harder to get to the top! I had great fun and found myself even enjoying working out which never happens. A must buy as far as I’m concerned."
36,Dravnos,22 days ago,3,Good app but lacking safety,"The app itself is great. The workouts are fun and engaging, especially when playing against other people. Main concern is this workout game makes you go hard, even on the easier training levels, and then just abruptly stops the level at the end. With that hard of a workout, it should have a cooldown option to allow you to come down from the high intensity  safely. Until the app utilizes a cooldown option, I do not feel safe playing it."
37,Rochelle,Mar 14 at 5:22 PM,4,Not for the depressed,"The user interface is not as clear as it could be to navigate. That being said, I really love this workout and am using muscles I didn't know I had, lol. The only drawbacks for me are the negative comments like when I haven't been on in a few days or, the 'so close, so far' comments when I don't hit the high points. I struggle with motivation. Knowing I will hear those little comments are a complete shut-down for me. Maybe it's aussie humor but it sucks. Welcome me if I show up and leave the other comments out. Some days I literally hear those comments in my head before I start and don't even begin.... I just go over to Beat Saber."

40,David,A day ago,3,Great workout app with a MAJOR glitch.,"This app would get 5 stars but a horrible glitch drops it two stars. 

So, let’s say you’re in the middle of a workout. You’re pumped, you’re in the mode etc.

All of a sudden, the targets shrink and raise to knee level. I noticed this seems to happen when squatting. It doesn’t happen ALL of the time but it has happened about 5 or 6 times at this point and it’s VERY frustrating. You can’t even pause the game to recalibrate the targets. You have to go back to the main menu and restart the round. I was able to get it recalibrated one time by stepping out of the boundary zone and it reset on its own.

Nevertheless, an incredibly aggravating glitch especially when it happens mid-round, with a great score. Sometimes I’ll take breaks from this and play Thrill of the Fight because being pissed off in the middle of a workout is not a good feeling lol.

Update: 4/11/2023 - Happened AGAIN when I did a squat… I’m not playing this until the problem is addressed. This is an extremely annoying glitch."
41,Streetwolf,3 days ago,3,"Nice fitness game, but size problem","It's fun and effective when it works. But my size changes all the time. Sometimes I'm 2 meters tall and quite often I'm only 1.50 meters. Sometimes I'm so tall that I have to kneel down or so short that I have to punch way above my head. That is no fun anymore.
Why do I indicate my height in the game if this is not taken into account?"

44,Doocey,Feb 21 at 2:22 PM,5,Great workout and pretty fun!,"I have been a pretty dedicated Supernatural user for over a year now and still am. I wanted to try something a bit different and see what else the Oculus marketplace had to offer. I read some reviews on Les Mills workout and figured I’d try it out. I did read there wasn’t any warm up mode on Les Mills so I threw on Supernatural and did a short 8-12 minute workout on there just to warm up. I have only been using the Les Mills Workout for a couple of days now, but I can tell you my muscles are sore all over my upper body and it feels great and I love the fact that they integrate knee thrusts into the workout too. So far so good. I will keep intertwining Supernatural and Les Mills workout for an optimal workout. Happy I made the purchase and I hope they keep on top of it and add new workouts and updates like Supernatural does."
45,Rachel Purvis,25 days ago,5,Great workouts!,I was a supernatural user.  I loved it so much I didn’t think I would be interested in any other boxing apps. The reviews on this app convinced me to try it. I will say it didn’t take long for me to unsubscribe from supernatural. Even the short workouts get your heart rate up. I also love the variety of hits. I do struggle with the knee strikes but they are getting easier. I sweat something fierce and I feel so bad a$$ afterwards. I love this app.
46,Pete,9 days ago,4,Cannot get on the VR wife’s addicted,"Bought 2 months ago and it is very good, I do have an issue with my wife always being on it! Great workouts and very addictive. Lost 5 kgs so far and getting better all the time.  Would be nice to get some updated workouts. Some of the longer ones are the shorter workouts patched together so can feel slightly boring if you have done the short ones as a warm up. 
Also it is a shame that I cannot see her scores due to me being account holder. She sees my score to beat"
47,Dudebro,Mar 12 at 4:52 PM,1,Don't waste your money,"The instructors say the same thing whether you're doing good or not. You can miss a target and they tell you good job. The exercise where you pull the target down and knee it doesn't work. I'd say one out of every 10 actually registers. No matter how hard I pull it down and knee it, it just doesn't work. I consider myself to be good at the vr rhythm games as I am a drummer in real life so I know it's not my timing. This game is garbage"
48,Abbp2021,Mar 12 at 4:29 AM,5,5 Star Lesmills Game/Workout,"I absolutely love this app. It is a great workout and I can choose short, medium and long workouts. I can also choose the intensity and   there is plenty of workouts to choose from. This game is amazing and worth every penny. This is great for fitness and losing weight. This is also great for people who have a busy schedule and little time for fitness."
49,Fuzalov Ahmadkhon,20 days ago,2,Hammers are broken,"I have some suggestions.
I missed every single hammer strike no matter how much I tried. I think it has issues. Besides, what is the point of making the targets so small or the gloves so small? Make the gloves larger. It's frustrating to miss when you tried so hard. Make it more rewarding and easy to hit. Increase the intensity a bit. Adjust targets so they scale to user body size, maybe."
50,Julie Peacock,20 days ago,5,Love it…,"Only got this today but love it already,  even though I’m the wrong side of 50, overweight and exercise shy, this was so much fun even though I only managed about 15 minutes will increase it each day.   If you want a referral for 25% off message me. 

I highly recommend this."
51,Toast,Mar 15 at 9:07 PM,4,Best VR workout by far.,"Very immersive and easy to get to grips with. I thought the constant push and chat from the trainers was going to be annoying, but actually no it really does help to get you motivated. 

If I do 45 minutes of this I am totally drenched in sweat, makes you work really hard as long as you don't cheat. 

Only reason I didn't give 5 starts is because I swear the point system is a little flawed due to the tracking of hands has it's issues. 

Otherwise the best VR workout out there by miles. You can keep your follow along DVD's, this is so much better."
52,Jen,Mar 9 at 2:29 PM,5,Great workout and no monthly fees!,"This is a fun, engaging and good for all levels workout. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and it has not gotten boring. The workouts range in length and intensity so that there is always something I have time and ability for.  Because I move a lot I have to recenter the game a few times during each session to stay on target, but there is time for that. Best of all no monthly fee. I have enough subscriptions that I don’t want to add another one. I would buy this again."
53,Austen Owens,23 days ago,5,Loosing weight is fun now!,I’ve lost 20 pounds doing this daily! This game has so much variety with workouts. I haven’t done cardio in the gym in months bc I burn about 500 calories in an hour here! It’s fun & the trainers are super encouraging! GET THIS GAME!
54,Ephrinia63,5 days ago,3,Great workout bad mechanics,"This could be a truly great workout, except for the mechanics of the game. It doesn't track my movements well. It may be that I hit just a bit off, but it ruins the whole experience.  I'm thinking about the problem, and not the workout. It should be more user-friendly."
55,Old Smokey,Jan 10 at 11:54 PM,5,This is the best fitness app available,"TLDR: This game is the best out there.  My only suggestion would be to have an in-app/in-game volume control.  See below for details.

I've used five other fitness apps before LMBC, and for me this is the best of them all. There are workouts for all levels.  It's easy to navigate the menu, and you can save your favorite workouts.  The calories burned is shown on your wrist during the workout session.  The tutorials at the bottom of the menu are helpful for learning the moves.  The music is good, and the rhythm of the songs are timed well with the workout.  There are in-app instructors, and I like to leave their voices on, because they actually help me with my timing and technique. There is another fitness app out there that I have to turn the instructors voice off, because it ruins the flow of the workout.  For me, the LMBC instructors don't ruin the flow of the workout.

I have a suggestion I think would be helpful for me and others.  

Would it be possible to have an in-app volume control for the music and instructors voices.  

My reason. My son lives in another city, and we meet in VR to do the LMBC workouts.  Since there is no multiplayer, we meet in VR.  Then we each go to our LMBC workout lobbies that show the menu.  Once we pick the same workout. Then we time the start of the workout so we're doing the same functional movements within a second or so of each other.  It actually works pretty good.  We're able to tell each other our overall scores and punch/knee/squat streak during the workout.  The only downfall is the instructors voices and music are to loud, and it makes it difficult to hear each other.  Unfortunately, we have to turn the instructors voices off and talk a little louder to hear each other over the music.      

If the developers could give us an in-app volume control, then we could leave the instructors voices on, and then only have to turn down the music and voices just a little bit to be able to hear each other."
56,Kadir,Mar 12 at 12:32 PM,5,A wonderful app without subcription,This is a wonderful and addictive fitness-app without subsription. New workouts are constantly being added with wonderful music. The music does not come from the charts but from free artists. But that makes it all the more interesting. I have tried many fitness-apps but this one is by far the best for me. Thanks very much.

I'm also happy to announce, that throughout the attempts of trying to recreate the issue, it seems the issue has been fixed in some combination between Oculus/Meta Quest Software updates and the game itself. Not exactly sure how it all collaborated to one another, but I'm glad, that it properly tracks my punches now! :)"
65,Laiqalous,18 days ago,5,Awesome,"One of the best work out platforms...I really enjoyed it,after each work out my body responses ...I request the team if they could add warmup and calm down sessions and custom audio tracks addition."
66,Kai,Mar 4 at 9:33 PM,5,I've never wrote a review before,"Bodycombat was something I'd been putting off purchasing for a long time because I was one of those people who didnt think you could really do fitness in VR. 

After using it for the first time and then 17th time- ongoing- I realized that I was wrong. 

The instructors are animated in their speech making it seem almost personalized. They're encouraging and realistic. 

I can't give a good enough review of the product so you'll just have to try it. Just remember, if you hate it- then look at the meta return policy. No loss."
67,Spoons,Mar 16 at 5:00 PM,5,Brilliant workouts and NO SUBSCRIPTION👍,"I bought this having read the other very positive reviews and I’m glad I did.

There are absolutely loads of different training challenges, based around boxing, Thai boxing etc, resulting in explosive full body workouts.  You choose the intensity level and duration that suits you and you get out of it what you put in.

What I really like with this app though, is during each training session, there is a score board/ladder offset in your peripheral vision where you can keep an eye on how you are doing against the other competitors.  You don’t see the other players, just a live, climb the ladder style score board.  Really helps you to get motivated and push your performance to try to climb to the top.

The only minor negative I have come across so far is, I went into an  “upper body” titled workout the other day and it had quite a lot of squats, swat holds and squat jumps in it.  Not ideal when I want to complete a high intensity hit session on my upper body but need to rest my legs.  

Overall, a really great, varied training experience that is more than worth the one off payment!!
That is the best part:
Absolutely no subscription 👍👍👍"

I bought this app for my husband, but I was surprised how much I enjoy the workouts. It’s fun, competitive, and motivational! I love that it’s not a subscription and it has low, medium, and high intensity. It’s one of my favorite apps on Quest 2!"

71,HuAvatar,Feb 28 at 10:01 AM,5,Highly Recommended,"This app is fantastic! The BodyCombat workout had my heart pumping, and I loved it.

Here are some of the things I appreciate about it:

First, the coaches are excellent at guiding you through the exercises.

The app shows you how you did the last time you did a track, which helps track progress.

Best of all, there's no subscription required! So it's definitely worth the money, and you'll feel like you've trained after a good session.

One area for improvement: I think it would be great if there were an option to change the background. Perhaps this could be added as an extra feature if needed.

Les Mills bodycombat is my favourite go to workout app.
It's like having a boxercise gym session in your own front room.
There is no subscription so pay once and get loads and loads of classes and content. There are so many different workouts you can work all parts of your body and you end up aching (in a good way) after intense sessions involving squats/boxing/slamming/thrusts etc etc. This is a must buy app!"
73,Albert,3 days ago,5,I like very much,It is perfect. I like a lot because is not with subscription. And I lose weight with this game
74,Maarty,Feb 27 at 7:52 AM,5,Great Workout !,"Overall great Fitness App. 
Lots of workouts so everyone will find something suitable for any fitness level. 
I also noticed kind of an afterburn effect so my muscles felt like they were still working even after the workout was done. 
Also this app is does not have a subscription model (yet) and I really hope it stays like this. 
I gladly pay for dlc with new courses and exercises. 

However I feel that often my punches do not connect with the targets no matter how how accurate my hits or how powerful they are. 
I did boxing for a while so I’m sure it’s not my technique. But when I just swing my Arms wildly they always connect so I am often tempted to just mess around to get a higher score. 
This can be a little frustrating if you are aiming to be on the top of the list and keep correct form. 

Overall it is still for me the best fitness app I have ever played. 
Additional options like a build your own workout or a non voiced mode would be great. 
But right now I am coming back to this app almost daily for a quick or a longer session until me and my quest a drenched in sweat. 

8/10


UPDATE: 

I have to update my review. 
The game does improve more and more with every update and the negative points from my first review on the technical side have been eliminated. 
This app improved my life so much. 
I also feel the they added kind of a warm up phase in the newer workouts which is great! 
Have to give it 5 stars now I would give even more if I could. 

Things I would love to see in the future: 

- Environment selection
- Profile selection pop up when I start the app bc I made so much points with my gfs profile >.<
- optional warm up 
- a video tutorial on how to do  moves because for some I do not feel that I am doing them correctly."
75,DarkZem,Mar 4 at 1:53 AM,4,Almost perfect,"The fact that EVERY. SINGLE. WORKOUT. In the entire app, that isn't a tutorial, has squats is madness. Maybe I have bad knees. Maybe I want to play it sitting down. Maybe I have a stationary bike and like to do legs one day and arms another. Maybe when I'm doing Upper body workout 6 I want to work out just my upper body. There's no reason EVERY. SINGLE. WORKOUT. needs squats. A quick toggle in the options to turn off squats and this would be a 10/10 workout app."
76,KellyDeann,Feb 26 at 6:39 PM,5,No Frills Booty Kicker,"Once you get the hang of this and move up to the advanced, you will be absolutely hooked (see what I did there).

83,LordSpack,Feb 23 at 7:46 PM,5,Best kickboxing app,"So thankful it's one time buy. It includes voice overs where trainers sound like they're human and playing with you. Although the scoring system is not perfect (it doesn't do a good job teaching you how to get a high score and posture tips go by too fast to absorb them), it doesn't matter because I'm burning 2x the calories I burn in beat saber and feel like I got a good sweat and feel awesome in a quick 20 minute session"

One question, if you can answer me: if I exercise online I burn a certain amount of calories (300 per hour at the highest level), if I do the same exercise offline the calories burned are almost the double.

87,Starfoxtrinity,Oct 7 at 12:27 AM,5,The journey of a Prediabetic,"In March of this year I was diagnosed as a pre diabetic. I was 394 lbs overweight and all my numbers were SUPER HIGH. I had fallen into depression and stopped taking care of myself. My inner battles were getting the best of me. I asked my (unsupportive) doctor if I could reverse this with a lifestyle change. He told me that he doubted me and he prescribed loads of medication. I was determined not to let this control my life so I started walking everyday starting with just a mile and increasing day by day. I found this app in the oculus and thought I’d try it. To my surprise, it was just the challenge I needed. 5-6 days a week I went hard and changed my diet, portion sizes and now I’m down 263 lbs and doing my first marathon this weekend. My journey started here and I am grateful."

91,SSnova75,Jan 21 at 9:53 PM,5,Go-To Fitness App,"I've had my Quest 2 for about 6 months and have played various AAA games but this game is the first that compelled me to write a review. My wife and I are in our late 30s and have tried and failed at many attempts to find a workout routine that works for both of us. We've just completed our 3rd week of workouts (3 per week) and I'm still blown away about how much more fun and motivating this is compared to my previous workout formats. With two small children and hectic days, the flexibility to start, or pause a social, trainer motivated workout whenever we want in our home goes lightyears to helping us stick with it. I've noticed first soreness, then toning in smaller muscle groups in my core, arms and legs that let's me know that the variety of workouts is working muscles that just weren't being used that much on my bike rides, or Max trainer. On top of all that, no subscription (yet, I hear it's coming) like comparable fitness apps and you've hit it out of the park! I'm also about to get the weights that attach to the controllers for even more intensity. Big thank you t the developers, this is life changing.
18 weeks update: Down to just under 250 pounds from 270, but I have added and toned much muscle (kiwi weights helped with that & over extension) best shape I've been in since I was 21. Goal is to keep pushing, get down to target weight. Wife is down too (she won't let me say how much though) and feeling confident. 
32 week update: up to just over 90 min advanced workouts 3 days a week and down to 237lbs. with quite a bit of added muscle. I've ditched the weighted controllers for dumbell sets before vr (helps elbows not get strained) and do 30 mins of HIIT on my Max trainer climber. I tried the two new workouts that look to be a glimpse of the subscription workouts, and I was impressed. It just might be worth it depending on the price."

93,Cassidy,Mar 15 at 8:13 PM,3,No Accessibility Settings at All,"As long as you won't be needing any kind of customization settings for your workout, then this app seems like a good buy for the one-time price. But, be aware that there aren't any visual, gameplay, or accessibility settings at all. You can't turn off vertical or horizontal walls/barriers, and there isn't anything like a no fail or accessible barriers option. The only current setting is you can turn the coach chatter off completely, but you can't just reduce it. 

You can choose workouts based on difficulty and they list the required moves. But there are only a handful that don't have squats as a required move... and most of those actually still require squats for some reason. As long as you have good knees and can do squats, this provides a solid workout. But if you have knee issues, it's just frustrating to use because you'll have to let the horizontal walls turn red and fly through your face and right through your line of sight quite a lot, and you won't be able to get much out of your personal score for the rest of the moves since you'll always be killing your combos. I get that it's intended to be a full-body workout, but VR is a good format to allow more people access to participate as they can. Adding a score reduction penalty for each modifier enabled is usually enough for apps to still keep competitive high scores limited to the full-intensity players.

TLDR; As long as you have good knees for squats, this is a well-made fitness program, but if you need any customization in your workout, this might be unusable for you."
94,bhillou,Feb 19 at 11:29 AM,5,Fabulous but musics could improve,"Almost everything is perfect about this app. Big thank you to the trainers that really are fantastic please keep them coming! I would happily buy some DLCs to support the game development but please don’t go to subscriptions like all the others. 
On the music side some tracks like Get Rekt are really not great and could benefit from being replace by some more melodic and motivating dance music. This is for me really the only flaw of this otherwise fantastic app !"

What makes this workout unique for me is the efficiency of the vr-based workout.

I do not need a lot of space, i do not need a partner to motivate me and most importantly i do not need a lot of time for preparation and workout. 

I like the coaches, like the trainings, love the fact thats it is not subscription based and hope that it stays that way. The leaderboard motivates me to give my very best. 

I would just wish for a better feedback as to in which intensity i strike the target. For example the sound or a special effect could vary depending on your current intensity („beast mode“ = burning gloves?)

In conclusion i am very happy with this app and would advise to use it in combination with a team sport."

106,Brian,Mar 17 at 11:20 AM,5,Best Workout App,"First off, the workouts are great! They’re super intense but not to the point you can’t do it. They really tailor the exercises well to the person.  
The only aspect I’m not a fan of is the UI. It’s hard to know which one to pick sometimes and you are given too many options. I wish it was more organized, I guess. This is easily a 5 star app. Only gave it 4 because I wanted people to read it."

108,FudgyPuck,Feb 14 at 7:28 PM,5,At last a non subscription fitness App,"Imagine, being able to go to a fitness class whenever you wanted.

Imagine going to the class in your own home. ( No travel to the gym, no feeling self-conscious in front of Gym Rats)

Imagine being the only one in the class, no worries about feeling out of place or not being good enough. 

Imagine spending as long in class as you want.... allowing you to build your fitness gradually. 5 mins, then 10, then more... in a time-frame that suits you.

Imagine lots of different workouts to build cardio and core fitness.

Imagine the trainer just focusing on you not a class full.

Imagine all that for a one off payment of less than £30.....
 
Les Mills gives you that and more, you can compare your progress with others across the world, and the trainers comments are generic but suitably encouraging.....and most important did I mention no subscription?

Also it's actually fun, I forgot I was exercising. My best Quest purchase to date in terms of both value for money and health benefits."

I know that if I don't get healthy, I have maybe 10yrs left and that not an option.   I work from home and my job is sedatary.   With that background, I knew I needed to do something and so...I did some research and found this.  Downloaded and tried for the 1st time yesterday.   Dear God, just the basic 8 min session had my arms and shoulders feeling it and sweat rolling.   (Sad I know)  I knew then, I was gonna go after this like a big man does ribs.  Today is day 2 and I am committed to doing 3 sessions a day along with a gallon of water and adjusting my food and sugar intake.  I am in love.  I just finished my 2md of 3 sessions and looking forward to my evening session.  I will keep updating this but my goal is to drop 50lbs in 8 months.  I strongly suggest anyone looking to make a change to give this a shot.  You will work, but it's fun and you will feel it.  Wish me luck.

And the best thing it’s a one time fee and you’ve got the whole training sets ready and available forever. Love it."

But tbh I'm done with this mediocre exercises ruined by the abuse of those useless, buggy knees hits, or until you provide something to replace those with something really useful:
They are just stupid. They registers half the time. How can you not be aware of that? Did someone even try the exercises your release?
They break every possible intensity in a training, either if you cheat and don't raise the leg at all, or you commit to do the movement (risking of hitting the controllers and losing the tracking for seconds...). 
It just doesn't make sense. They don't involve fatigue at all. It's just stupid.
And now new exercise only do that. I'm sorry but you are forcing me to look elsewhere to have some proper training."

There are 4 minute workouts to 25 minute workouts and I can pick the ones that I have time for or depending on my level of laziness for the moment.

127,cezar,Dec 10 at 1:01 AM,5,Read this for a 25% discount!,"Les Mills Bodycombat is basically a gamified version of the Les Mills workout method, a patented fitness program that uses combat techniques as a functional workout exercise. 

Les Mills Bodaycombat will certainly push you in the workouts that are available, and from all the fitness applications/games I have used in VR, I have felt the burn the most in this. Coming from professionals in this area, you get personal trainers that push you hard, but, they might become annoying to some - so an option to turn them off wouldn't go a miss. With no subscription service being involved, you really do get value for your money content wise, with more content planned down the line. If you are looking a VR fitness application, I would certainly recommend trying Les Mills Bodycombat.

128,Arthur,Jan 11 at 12:24 PM,4,"Good overall, though somewhat limited","Pros:
- Good sequences and some programs are very effective calorie-wise
- Good amount of exercises to pick from for a beginner

Cons: (obviously subjective)
- Looong startup time. Not really clear what is there to load so it takes 40 sec
- Target aiming is somewhat offset - you don't get the biggest circles when hit exactly in the middle, rather when hit slightly above the centre. Also, the hit force determining algorithm is not clear - sometimes you get a huge circles just barely hitting the target and sometimes just a medium circle with 100 kg punch. 
- lack of punch speed/force estimation and it's progress is very missing.
- Knee targets timing is very problematic - you have to hit it very early compared to how it would look in real life in order not to miss and loose the scores.
- The coach comments get rather repetitive in no time, so turned them off."

It’s so much fun, I don’t even realize it until I’m toast at the end of it.  The calories burned and heart rate levels are right where I need them.

Little hint for those who think they can get back into fitness after a long break - there’s crouch punches in this that you should make sure your form is right and your back is strong (had to take a week and a bit off to recover from that one!)"

It's just disappointing cuz I really like this game and want to use it and it sucks that I can't. Help developers."

I actually damaged myself when I first downloaded it as I did one too many workouts and was out for the count for the remainder of the week! Muscles were dead!! But on a serious note it’s actually quite addictive. I thought I had reached the limits with VR workouts as I have quite a few downloaded but this app takes it up a notch. I’ve never sweat this much in my life! 

I use to do Les Mills classes at my local gym but haven’t been going since lockdown. I was thinking about returning as I really missed them But after downloading this I think I’m good!!

Would love some more lower body workouts on here I feel like it goes hard on upper body but overall it’s a fab app and would recommend to anyone wanting to keep fit.

I always do the hardest tier of workouts for about 20 minutes and even in winter I’m sweating and have to clean up my headset afterwards. Nice variety but like most you hear the same comments from trainers repeated after awhile so I’m hoping for updates to keep it from getting monotonous.

Some players have reported that the immersive VR experience makes it easier to stay motivated and engaged during their workouts, compared to traditional fitness methods. Overall, LES MILLS BODYCOMBAT is a well-designed and effective fitness game for VR users looking for a challenging workout."

My Oura ring is telling me that my exercise is now “moderate”, so I need to up my game because my heart and endurance is that much BETTER. It’s fun! I do a Supernatural 25 minute workout, then head over to Les Mills to work my arms and shoulders. I’m seeing a real difference too.  Highly recommend."
145,Iamvictorcuadros,Dec 18 at 3:04 AM,5,Amazing!,"Beat saber and thrill of the fight are awesome, but this is in a whole different  level, I really love to workout  but winter slowed me down and gained a bunch of pounds, this is perfect, it even make me go to my red zone with my fitbit.

The best part is when you compete with more people and you see the chart on top, it makes you go harder.

Thanks a lot for this game!"
146,MightyAboba,Feb 22 at 6:49 PM,4,"This what I've been waiting for, BUT...","Fitness based on box is that's why I've fallen in love with VR. I'd finished Thrill of The Fight on outclassed difficulty level and thought what to do next and universe heard my wishes. This what I've been waiting for. Absolutely fun game that take all out of you, all your muscles will be burning, even legs. Five stars, without a doubt!
UPDATE: Do something with music, it's demotivating, trap and other slowish monothonic ""music"" are ineligible for fitness. I just stop striving when hear this. I just have tried FitXR and want to say that it has a way better music despite of the fact that everything else in LM Body Combat is more solid. Use uplifting trance, drum'n'bass or anything else energetic, somehing with 140bpm and higher rate. ""Tell Me"" in Fast Fists session is a brilliant example of perfect song to squeeze everything out of body. Now the trend is that there are more slow and boring(even tedious) songs than energetic ones."
147,Alex,Feb 1 at 7:04 AM,5,Great Cardio,Believe all the 5 star reviews. This is the only non subscription based workout on the App Store and it’s a GREAT workout. Varying intensities and leaderboards keep it fresh and the virtual instructors keep it engaging. It doesn’t have the brawling of thrill of the fight but if you’re looking for an actual workout and less of a game this is it.
148,Radowan,Feb 1 at 2:03 PM,5,Best workout app,"Multiplayer points competition with real players played before, super guides with tutorials how to exercise and no subscription.

154,Loïc,Jan 29 at 6:50 AM,5,WOW!!! This is the best workout app!!!,"I hesitated a long time before I eventually decided to buy this app. Was not convinced by the video, but the comments were excellent... And gosh, they can be!  This app ROCKS!!! Les Mills videos inside the app are nice, comments are here to motivate us, the social mode is just what you need to get motivated if you like competition without feeling socially pressured, the exercises are varied, the connection between the moves and the music is perfect, graphics are marvelous and take you to another dimension, all this without any other engagement but to pay the app once and for all. Les Mills have totally understood what we as users want and need, and have delivered a masterpiece for home training!

Sole potential improvement that I have noted: when my 9-year son wanted to use the app, the targets were Pugh too high for him to reach even though we created him a profile with the right height. That was a pity as he could not enjoy the training, contrary to the Thrill of the Fight that adjusts very well to his height. Would be great if it could be fixed in the future 😉"

Before I used Supernatural and even Freeletics (not in Oculus), and I end up not doing it every day. But with Bodycombat is different, the fact that you feel in a “real” class, the staff seems real, compete with other players in order to finish first in the rank give you this extra push to don’t give up!

And don’t forget this app is just one time payment not a subscription program that cost you 19,99$ per month.

Totally a no brain buy!"

I’m already sweating after these tutorials. Then I would play 2 games. It works out your abs, arms, legs basically your whole body. Great cardio workout. I walk 3 to 6 miles a day and I don’t sweat like this when I play this game. Before I even start this game I do my 12 minute dynamic stretching to loosen up. Very important. Wish I bought this game a year ago. Can’t go wrong.  Here’s my referral link if you decide to buy this game or any games.

160,Melissa,Jan 28 at 5:07 PM,5,Best VR game ever!,"Our entire family LOVES this ""game""! I hadn't done a squat in close to 20 years before I started this, and now I can do 30-50 per session! My only complaint is that I don't know if we can compete against friends scores unless we are on the primary account. Can someone help? I need in my setting that ""friends"" is turned on, but their scores are only visible if I amlogged in as my son. It doesn't make sense to all use his account, because then we aren't tracking our individual progress.  Also, can't we compete against members of our own household?! That would encourage us so much more! Please m

161,Wendy,Jan 28 at 3:08 AM,5,Best workout you will ever do,"After reading the reviews from other people I decided to try this workout.  I hate working out but this game is so much fun….. I mean fun and fast pace that you cannot believe you did 12 minutes of intense boxing and squats, and it’s done.  You are are not checking the time to see how much longer it has to go before your finished.  A lot of different workouts to choose from so you never get bored and for me I am sweating a storm.  I usually do 2 workouts back to back but I love it.   Well worth the money and your time if a workout is what you are looking for."
162,Necta,Jan 28 at 6:03 PM,5,Amazing combat fitness,"I was sceptical about getting a good work out using the VR .. at first it was strange getting used to wearing quite a heavy head set to train.

It’s low impact and the advanced classes are high intensity , I can burn between 400-450 calories per hour and just feel like I’m playing a game . Buy it you won’t regret it , be prepared to work up a sweat!!"

169,ToneshaB,Jan 26 at 5:14 AM,5,Enjoying this work out app!,"I’m really enjoying working out with Dan and Rachel. 
I love their voice and motivation.
I stopped going to body-combat at the gym because it is so much more effective having an actual target to hit and a scoring database to know how I’m performing. 

Once ya get the hang of the knee jabs (if I’m saying the name correctly) you will love it.

I enjoy this , I love the option of different times and intensities.

It’s Totally worth it."
170,Sahil,Jan 2 at 3:51 AM,5,My best purchase on quest 2,This is a must buy for those looking to get the most out in 20-30 minutes. One time purchase no subscription is the real deal here. The workouts are engaging and the trainers really motivate you to push your self . I quickly moved to the intense workouts in a few weeks and just a 20 minute workout can give u immense satisfaction! Would love it in the future there can be more music or allow us to play our tracks!

178,Predtek,Jan 27 at 6:53 AM,5,Surprised! Best workout app for me!,"I was hesitant but after reading some reviews here. I bought it and am not disappointed. I can say so far it is the Best VR workout for me hands down. I have tried many other apps/games to boost my workout motivation. This app does it right. Best of all it is not subscription based and they make new content for free regularly. I am the type of guy who would gladly pay for new content but like I have said. I do need more motivation so I did end up subscribing for another app and not using it much to justify the costs. This app is fast paced, warms you up and keep you pumped full of sweat. The two instructors are fun, cheerful and motivating. There are quite a few variation of the moves requiring full body movements so it doesn’t get boring. The title might sound underwhelming but it is really a full package. The music is great too. One thing I would love to see is a settings page where I can adjust the volume of the punching sounds. Louder the better!"
179,Robert,4 days ago,1,Doesn’t work,Can’t get any of the workouts to load.
180,Dr Mick,Jan 22 at 4:21 PM,5,Better than a real gym!,"Got this about 10 days ago and really  love it. In fact, I think this is better than a real gym, because it lets me quickly jump in and do a workout between activities so that I manage to reach my daily goal.
The only minor gripe is that the pointer constantly defaults back to the right hand for selections. I am left handed so please let me set that as default!"
181,Abe,Feb 28 at 6:36 PM,5,Really good,Would love to have more leg exercises but it is so much fun! You will be finished and def need a shower afterwards.
182,Dreadpiratk,Jan 21 at 6:23 PM,5,Surprisingly good burn!,"I was an avid CrossFiter for years until my local box closed. This app is the first time I’ve been able to get that level of a workout since then, at least on the high intensity workouts. Like anything else you can do the minimum or do it with intensity but the app does a good job of not counting punches that lack force, and encouraging you to keep pushing. Overall I’m very happy with it."
183,MissHapp,Mar 8 at 1:33 AM,5,Need More Stars,This is such a great way to workout. It totally kicks my butt in the best way possible.
184,KJ,Feb 18 at 7:37 AM,5,Best workout app!!,I have tried many workout apps both VR and regular. This is by far the most engaging series I have found. It’s actually fun and makes me want to workout!!
185,ThisMetaLovesYou,Feb 14 at 10:53 PM,4,"Awesome game, but one huge frustration","I've tried many VR fitness apps, and honestly Body Combat VR has a lot of polish, good music, cool trainers, and a TON of moves that other apps don't have.  It's almost enough to give it an edge over it's competitors on the Quest...almost.  

First of all, there aren't nearly as many trainers, or classes as other apps.  There's no warmups or cool down sessions.  Second, you're not going to get any recognizable music, but what's there is actually pretty good and integrated with the workouts really well.  Both of these issues are fundamentally the result of not having a subscription fee, so it's not really an issue if you prioritize the one time payment over the lack of extra content & music. 

They have already added a free update that added new arenas, classes, and music.  

The graphics are pretty crisp and it's easy to see what's headed your way.  The trainers do a good job engaging you, despite getting a bit repetitive over time.  The scoreboard is a good motivator as well, just like in other fitness apps.  
As I mentioned there are more moves here than in other similar 'boxing/combat' style games.  You have jabs, crosses, uppercuts, hammer fists, body jabs, sky punches, squats, weaves, and KNEES.  They're all pretty responsive except for knees.  

My biggest complaint, the thing that makes me not want to even load up a session anymore, is how inaccurate the knees maneuver is.  I've tried everything I can think of to get it to register as a hit instead of a miss, and nothing works.  If I do get a hit, it's just a random occurrence, not anything I can replicate.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to getting a knee hit to register in game.  I guess it could be a skill thing, but I've played a lot of rhythm and fitness games, and this is the only move that ever broke me and made me give up.  

If they could change the timing, or the hit detection, or anything to fix that unresponsive knee move, I'd upgrade this to 5 stars.  There's a lot to like here."
186,Marvin,Jan 20 at 5:40 AM,5,Best workout app on Quest + 25%off link,I have tried many workout app on quest and this is the best so far. It actually teaches you how to box in a natural way.

187,ELTORO7,Jan 20 at 3:39 AM,5,BEST VR EXPERIENCE EVER!,"Hands down the best thing I have done in VR. Ever. 

Different workout intensities means everyone is challenged. Choreographed workouts means I am lost in the music; the movement and the experience. Having done BODYCOMBAT live in a gym - this is the real deal. The trainers, Dan and Rach, are phenomenal at keeping you in the zone and somehow knowing just what advice and motivation you need throughout. Time truly flies by. From the start it's clear Les Mills is a premier fitness company with heritage and purpose. Everything is about creating the workout experience; getting the heart rate up, the blood pumping and the sweat flowing.

Can't believe this is a one-time purchase. Do it. You wont regret it.

Ps - @Meta: you should bundle this with the Quest 2 Active Pack. It definitely justifies the purchase......."
188,Darla408,Feb 8 at 1:20 AM,5,,I love getting a great workout at home and Les Mills does it for me ! It feels great when you can work out your upper and lower body in one boxing exercise ! Lovin it for now ! Hoping  they keep it fresh .
189,Daniel,Jan 1 at 6:20 PM,1,A frustrating waste of $$,"I really wanted to love this game, and I still love the concepts behind it and variety of workout options but…..
The gameplay itself is terrible which ruins the entire experience. It really feels like this was developed by a high school STEM class for final project or something. 

Yes, the initial load screen is annoyingly long but even that could be overcome if it had good game mechanics. 

I’ve played every other boxing/fitness game out there and this is by far the worst as far as game mechanics.  I seem to get ‘credit’ for about 50-60% of the hits during a given session.  My gloves often just go through the target with no impact registered.  I rarely have this issue with SN or XR Fit. 

The only thing this game does well is show why SN is worth $20/ month.  I would have less frustration if I flushed the $20 for this game(luckily it was on sale) down the toilet, because I’d have no expectations."
190,Carl,Feb 6 at 2:39 AM,5,Wow,Great app went down 2 belt sizes in 2 weeks I recommend this highly and it's fun. You get better movement for boxing which is handy and you keep fit. I ain't bought a lot of games on the vr yet but couldn't find a fault with the game
191,Nyrulez,Jan 19 at 8:08 AM,5,Feels like a real workout,"There are many touted ways and apps to workout with VR but few apps feel like a real workout, something you could use as a viable alternative to cardio in the gym. This one does it for me. Both the coaches are awesome and it has different levels of intensity to meet different needs. 

I also like the variety offered for move sets. It goes beyond basic punching. 

I do wish it had some kind of endless mode to train stamina and endurance. I imagine 3 levels of difficulty but it doesn't need to end unless you want it to."
192,Basty-RO,Jan 19 at 8:40 PM,5,Is the best workout app oculus quest,"I have try it all games and workout apps in oculus store and I'm sure that's de best on. Till I try this, I was sure that Fitvr is was the best, but in Fitvr only boxing classes are well made, the rest is not that great. 
Supernatural is nice to but is too expensive.
But this one, has a good price for what is offering. The graphics are good to and the fitness exercises are really well made for the full body, not only boxing.
So, from my opinion, is worth buying it!"

I’m in my late 40’s and wanted an app to build muscle tone and keep me moving whilst working from home. Starts you off at level one but you quickly move up those levels so be prepared."
198,Isperatus,Jan 18 at 11:51 AM,5,Wonderfully challenging and fun,"I love the trainers, they are fun, knowledgeable and inspiring. 
I love the moves and different modes the game has. 
Despite little customization I love that it's focused on results rather than customization but it would be a nice thing to have. 
I've had workouts were i could barely move my arms, and yet the coaches keeps pushing you to excellence. 
Biggest plus, no subscription model. I would rather buy trainings individually than pay monthly for this. 

All in all thank you for this nice app !

Tip to the devs: pls pls add some kind of points system that allow you to buy some customizations with it, gives you a real nice awards system (similar to VrIt)."
199,Super Nova Juice,Jan 18 at 8:19 AM,5,Best Workout on VR,"So, just to be honest, I have been doing Les Mills workouts for years and I love them. I found out about this game through Les Mills regular body combat and I was so excited that I bought my Quest 2 just to be able to play it. I was NOT disappointed! I was more sore than I have been after a regular a regular body combat session since like my first one. This game makes me punch so much. I will admit that it is not as much of a full body workout as regular body combat but if you are not doing regular BC then this is the best way to go for exercise. 

There are some thing I would change like those knee strikes! I hate them. But I have gotten better at them with practice. I missed everyone at first not I might only kiss o e or two in the sequence. There are not frequent updates (con) but there are plenty of workouts available and I just try to increase my score each time and the game keeps track for you which is pretty cool. 

The only game that I’ve played that made me work harder than this one is Thrill of the Fight but that one is so much more boring and has no rocking music."
200,Richelle,Jan 20 at 5:21 AM,5,Love this workout!,"Since I have started this workout, it makes me strive to keep going daily. After 5 days, I have noticed my arms already starting to show definition, I just love that. 
It's hard to believe that something can be so much fun without the feeling of dread of like when you have to go to a gym."
201,Tora,Jan 27 at 1:24 AM,5,Love ittt!,I love how the game does not have a subscription. The workouts are the best! You can choose your intensity level. Depends on how you are feeling that day. You want a full 25min workout or a few short ones. It gets you moving and your heart rate going.
202,Zorbonium,Mar 14 at 12:28 AM,5,Love it,"Great workout, great app."
203,Molly,Feb 9 at 2:25 AM,3,Annoying Music & Repetitive Coaching,"So, after doing this for about a week I already know all the songs and what the coaches are going to say. It is a fun workout but they really need to improve the music and the same 10 things that the coaches say.  I think I am going to turn the volume off and just listen to my headphone if that is possible.  Much room for improvement"
204,CHRISTINE,Jan 16 at 9:02 PM,5,Best workout ever!,"I didn't like exercising before I found this app. I love it so much, I've incorporated it into my daily routine. 

I like how it's a one time purchase and they regularly add new workouts, unlike other apps where you have to pay a monthly subscription.

The one thing I find annoying is that it doesn't always register a direct hit and that resets my combo score. I do believe it's the game and not my VR system because it happened on my son's system before I bought my own. 

That's another thing, I bought my own QUEST2 specifically because I wanted to play this game daily and my son takes his to his father's every other week. 

You won't regret purchasing this app.

Great job devs!"
205,Jwawa1,Jan 16 at 11:20 PM,5,Les Brown Body Combat,"Have used this program for a little over a week and find it’s good for a core muscle workout. I’m retired and have found a slight loss of muscle tone since I no longer do the continual movement of a normal workday. After the second day felt a soreness in my legs and then did a upper body workout that was pretty intense and expect some shoulder tightness tomorrow. Overall, this is a great boxing program and as a added “plus” there is no monthly charges that many of the other boxing programs seem to require."
206,Dae,Feb 16 at 9:08 PM,1,Unrealistic,"Other player scores are so unrealistic. We know  of we aren't playing against other humans but at least make it look real.
They start off real bad and then closer to the end of the workout they score skyrockets and surpass us even if we are doing perfectly. It's supposed to motivate us but it's just frustrating.

Good point is that this app is not super woke like fitXR. No LGBT/fat/handicapped coaches."

209,Ballbag,Jan 16 at 12:13 AM,5,The competition makes you so much harder,"I have the les mills app and generally use thier various work outs thru the week.

But the combat on the oculus is something else entirely!

Because it's a little more competitive as you are trying to beat the other peoples scores and hitting harder because the harder you hit the more to you score.

I burn far more calories then i would in a normal 30 minute combat.

My requests for the developers would be:
Live online play
More excerises (i've nearly done all the harder ones now)
More structured feedback to individuals based on hand positions ect 
Help with the knees, they are so hard to get right."
210,Vince,Jan 15 at 11:25 PM,5,You don’t realize you’re working out,"And that’s the point, right? Lots of workouts and lots of levels to choose from. Being able to compare your score against other competitors fuels that competitive fire and gives it a little something extra. It does take a little while to get your timing right on some of the targets, but be patient. It will come. My only suggestion is if you have the original foam face cover for your Meta Quest. You’re going to sweat. A lot. Buy one of the silicone face covers so you can wipe it clean when you’re done. Some days you may even fog over the lens, so ￼have some lens wipes handy too."
211,Sandro,Feb 24 at 8:50 PM,4,Knees hitbox is terrible otherwise top!,"As title states the knees hitbox is terribly implemented, most of the time it does not match what you see.

Considering this app is a once-off payment (ie No subscription) I figured I’d get it for this low price! And boy was I impressed! I always breakout in a sweat and now have two fans beside me to keep my workouts as cool as possible. 

The total body workouts are awesome will leave you feeling like you’ve had a personal trainer in real life putting you through a great cardio session! It’ll have you doing squats, punching, knee’ing, weaving etc. 

The leaderboard is nice albeit not live but keeps me a little competitive to always try my hardest. 

It’s kind of like “boxercise” and always make me sore the next day. This is an awesome app that I’ve now incorporated into my regular weights exercises.

218,Ambdi,Nov 16 at 6:41 AM,5,Best training app to tone up,"This is the best workout fitness program that is even better than the real body combat because it helps you to calculate your workout performance and provide visualisation of the punches. 

A lot of upper body workout to tone the shoulders, arms and chest.

If u ask me whether it gets your heart rate up and give u a good calories burn … it does. There are times that my arms were aching to the max but the afterburn in the muscle is a great fat burner. 

Would be great if developers will add a feature to invite friends to join a workout instead of random strangers in the same session."
219,Tomcat,Feb 19 at 11:49 PM,5,Fun Workout,"This workout is so much fun, sometimes I forget that I'm working out until the next morning and my muscles are sore."
220,Stacey,Jan 13 at 6:00 PM,5,I Love Les Mills!,"Les Mills Body Combat is the reason I bought Q2.  Dan and Rach are amazing instructors.  I’m a long time Les Mills Body Combat fan and this game is an awesome workout!  I’ll admit the knee strikes have been difficult to master but I’m determined to figure out the proper technique. 
I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys working out and having fun at the same time."
221,RAR,Jan 6 at 1:02 AM,3,Fix the Knee detection for 5 star,"My wife has been doing Les mills over you tube for some time, she loves the VR experience. I workout as well and decided to give it a go, I tell you, if you do it right it makes you sweat good. HOWEVER, my MAIN gripe is the ""knee"" hits....honestly I have tried every combo to make it work, I watched videos of people saying to do it one way or another...I am lucky to get 2 out 10 knee hits register..and when you look at your score go down it really erks you because you don't know how to make it detect accurately.  They need to either adjust the hit box or at the VERY least have a tutorial/training/calibration(?) that will teach you the method until you get it right. 
The Short intro they give to you basically shows you what you ""should"" do, give you a few tries and no matter if you connect or not it says ""great! you got it...when in reality you did not get even one...and then comes the class and you just feel like your failing miserably. 

Fix this and I will come back and give this a 5 star...until then you are lucky I give a 3."

223,Teach,Jan 11 at 4:57 AM,5,Love It!,Due to an illness and injury I had to quit all of my workouts for about 2 years. My son talked me into buying a vr headset so I could do some home workouts. I found the Les Mills app and love it!  I have worked up to the medium intensity and can really feel my energy levels coming back up.  I find I forget how long I have been working out because I am addicted to breaking all of the targets that come my way.   I highly recommend this app and know I will be using it for a long time.
224,Toocoolracing,Feb 26 at 3:51 AM,5,Great app,Great app. No complaints. Wouldn’t hesitate to get. Good workouts.
225,Naughty-Mommy,Feb 18 at 7:34 AM,5,Great workout!,Really love this app. The workouts are great!!!! Thank you for not requiring a subscription! Looking forward to more workouts!!
226,Chet,Jan 10 at 1:28 PM,5,What I have been looking for!,"I am a 46 year old man who works in a factory where I am moving, bending, and walking pretty consistently. I used to go to the gym every afternoon but it was a hassle because I had to drive into town after work to work out and then drive 30+ minutes in the opposite direction to get home. Got the Occulus 2 and after reading the reviews tried this App. After the first 14 minute workout I was TIRED! I pushed through and did the workout again that day and the next morning I was sore. My 22 Year Old Son tried it, he thought it was easy,  next day He calls me to tell me how sore He is! This APP is the real deal. It is fun, it will work You out, and after a week and a half I am already noticing increased strength. You will have to put in the effort. Punch hard, squat low, get into it. If You hate going to the gym but want to work out at home this is the ticket. Great price, lots of routines to choose from, motivated instructors, and it's easy to work out when You have fun. I have even added a set of 2lb wrist weights into the workout and, well try it Yourself."
227,Owen H,Dec 15 at 4:57 PM,5,Good workout and variety,I was waiting for another game in development to release the full game when I stumbled upon Les Mills Bodyconbat on sale. No regrets at all. I keep fit with a very good five day week gym session and this just tops my cardio up nicely as and when I need to. Certainly gets your heart rate up and builds a sweat. Great variety to choose from too. Short introduction lessons up to a 25 minute routine. Something for all levels of fitness. Nice encouraging shouts from the virtual trainers who don’t get too annoying. Looking forward to more lessons once I’ve finished the huge selection on here. Good job guys. A winner.
228,Joemac,Jan 28 at 2:59 AM,5,Cannot wait to get home from work,"I have only used this for a week and I get such a great workout.  I suggest getting a silicone based cover for your Q2 because you are going to sweat.   No subscription, great workout-no brainer."

231,Ruzu,Dec 7 at 3:55 AM,5,Absolutely amazing,I purchased this game today. It feels so real that I don't even think i can call it a game. It is literally like having your very own fitness instructor 24/7. I did two workouts (the first two recommended in the game) and they were amazing and a real workout. I feel like my health has a lifeline and am excited to continue playing and feeling healthier and fitter!
232,juancarr,Jan 27 at 6:31 PM,4,Potential to be a 5 star,"I work on ships so have limited options and room for fitness. So this doesn't need a large area which is really good for me ,it works offline which is hugely important to me ,I avoid alot of apps because there online only. The actual fitness element and execution are brilliant .But 1 star lost because of the lack of stats ,theres no stats offline which gives you nothing to compare and work to,even if it just saved your best scores and combos would be really helpful but also maybe a ghost mode where your best score is playing alongside you, like the online players scores. The online version the stats are still very very basic and better stats and maybe even achievements would give more to aim for and help inspire people to work harder. 
All in all for me the best VR fitness app by a long long way and I am encouraged by the recent update hopefully more will follow."

234,Mandy,Feb 14 at 11:43 AM,5,Top notch,This is the best workout app I have tried gives you a 100% workout that really works those muscles
235,Ric,Jan 29 at 9:25 PM,4,Unexpectedly good,The trailers made it look good but don't they always. However it actually is good. I'm a regular gym attendee. Usually 4 times a week but this is an enjoyable add on to my exercise weekly totals. I do it because its enjoyable more than for any perceived benefits. Highly recommend.
236,Splash,Jan 9 at 12:12 AM,5,BEST WORKOUT I HAD SO FAR ON THE QUEST 2,"I wanted to try this game out, because I needed a app that I can train my condition with and gives me a good workout. 
Its TOP!! Never sweated so much before in a game! The trainers are great, loads of workout options and the kinda social aspect with the scoreboard (which pushes you further if you are a little bit compatative). 
I LOVE IT!"
237,Matt Bandura,Feb 22 at 8:59 PM,4,Best app on q2,"Awesome app, I only wish updates with more workouts where more frequent. And there should be an option to play custom music or mute music but leave commentary"
238,Trace,Feb 23 at 4:43 PM,4,Better than expected,"I thought this was going to be a gimmick with cheesy instructors but it's not a gimmick. The instructors are still cheesy though, lol. It makes it fun and sometimes unintentionally funny though. I just got it but it's already more of a workout I'm willing to do with just a basic routine. I honestly can't wait till i can do the more extreme sessions. The beginning ones are actually a really good workout for those who don't workout regularly. Took me a bit to get the hang of the knee ones but nothing seems glitchy. If it starts getting glitchy I'll probably drop a star though. Definitely worth it especially since there is no subscription, puts it above the other apps.  Makes it feel like they're actually  wanting people to workout and not just trying to get money out of you. The fact it feels like a game makes you forget it's a workout till you notice you're out of breath. A purchase i do not regret.

Update: Two and a half weeks in and I'm about ready to move up to intermediate. I'm not feeling as exhausted as when i first started. I don't really mind the instructors talking you through but it does get a little old hearing the same lines and jokes. It would be nice to have the option to turn the instructor talking off on the workouts you've done several times. Not a game breaker though and easily ignorable. The app is still totally worth it. I'm actually starting to see results and can see the difference in my arms and upper abs.

Update: going on the end of 4 weeks of using this app 5-6 days a week. Just hit level 28. Been focusing on full body or core sessions. Still not hitting every hit perfect but I've stopped focusing on points or perfection. Really see no point in focusing on points because i think the other players points aren't real. First hint was when i ducked 2 walls, 2,,000 points each, and noticed the other 'players' have points that aren't divisible by 2,000. But that's ok though. I don't use this app to beat other people. I use it to try and better myself and i am getting better. Still my only complaint is the narration. It's non stop. I get it if they're letting you know what's next or how to do a certain part but I've heard the ""these puppies are sick"",""the tickling your kid"", and ""superhero costume"" jokes way too many times. Then there's when they sing to or make comments on the songs. Some of these songs are pretty good and i would honestly like to just work to the beat of them but it's hard when you got someone constantly talking over it. It's cute and fun at first but gets irritating quickly. A commenter mute option would be greatly appreciated.

Final update: level 38 now and I don't know if i can do this anymore. It's the commentary. I heard a joke about tea 5 times in one 10 minute routine. Thought once i moved up to advance maybe the commentary would chill out. Nope! It's still non-stop. I'm at a point where i could do these routines for 30-45 mins without having to push myself too hard. I have to push myself harder to deal with the commentary than to do the actual workout. It's more of a distraction than a help. I think my eyes get more of a workout than the rest of my body from rolling my eyes every 10 seconds. PLEASE! I'm begging you, put in a commentary off/ mute option! I get that some people like the motivative comments but half of it is just lame jokes, random laughing, and them singing to the song or making a comment about the song. Then there's the part where it was explained how to do the t fist punch. Now, this is on advanced and in a routine that has already had t fist punches before the explanation."
239,Andrei Popovici,Jan 3 at 7:39 PM,5,"I am Vr Fit fan, and this is amazing","I’ve been using for 1year+ the FitXr app for fitness. And was very happy and surprised this app introduced new things, movements to make it more exciting.

All in all it is a great app, if they decide to add new addons, or even introduce a subscription based to get new routines and classes will be buying them.

Whenever i go on holiday, etc..i take the VR with me to do my daily exercises.

I highly recommend this app, it will give you a good workout : A+++"
240,Kez,Jan 7 at 7:59 AM,5,Great workout,"Great for getting the heart rate up. I’m also improving my reflexes and boxing techniques. Best part No subscription.

I needed to move more with WFH so 20 min in the morning, and after dinner and suddenly the weight started to drop off. Started to eat healthier and my clothes got baggy and the scales told the proof. 

The exercises are fun and the trainers go through the motions in a good way. I have tried other apps but this one with the scoreboard and bit of variety sticks. It's now part of my routine and I really enjoy it. 

PROS 
No ongoing subscriptions. 
You can set the time of the work out. Good trainers.
Motivating scoreboard and calories burned. 
Easy to understand. 
Does the job. 

CONS
You might lose more weight than you expected
You will be sore at first
You need some space to do the program


One of the best programs out there."
244,Emma,Feb 25 at 11:25 AM,5,Love this game,Definitely a good game to work up a sweat too 😁
245,bondatfamu,Jan 2 at 8:30 AM,5,Sets the standard for VR,"Great concept, great implementation — great VR app. The coaches are realistic and encouraging and the workouts are fun, engaging and really get the heart rate up and sweat flowing. After second day of workouts I actually started to feel that muscle soreness that I’ve gone so long without. 

Enjoy this so much that I’ve already gifted it to a friend! Keep all the great content coming!"
246,Hello,Jan 25 at 11:23 PM,3,Devs help!,For some reason I am noticing my right side targets seem to be crooked compared to my left. During rope slams my right side targets are slightly behind the left. Resulting in me losing combos and having to micro manage my precision. No matter how many times I reset my oculus placement using the oculus button it does not help. I even insure I am right on the foot markers and squared up with the room. Any suggestions?
247,Jason,Jan 5 at 4:01 PM,5,Has me sweating every time - love it!,"This game is a proper work out!
I’ve done 20 minutes every day for last week and a half, I’m aching all over, I’m covered in sweat after every session - it’s exactly what I’d expect from a proper gym class!
It’s good fun too, which definitely helps bring me back each day."
248,ttmc,Jan 20 at 3:06 PM,2,New update has ruined it,"Had a nice routine in workouts I was using now it's been updated these workouts are no longer the ones I was using, targets coming in much faster the rings looked better before know you can hardly see them.

251,Momma,Feb 11 at 3:30 AM,4,Love the app!,This app gives me the best workout compared to all other workout apps!  The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the inability to play online when my quest 2 is connected and I can’t see my progress!
252,Jeroen,Jan 6 at 1:48 AM,5,Awesome,"After a year of personal training i was in doubt if I wanted to continue on the same expensive path. Although the results were there, the trainers were awesome it was also really expensive. So looking for alternatives lead me to trying this. I can honestly say that this app is incredible. It is fun, it really gets your heart pumping and the physics in the game when punching somehow really feel like you are actually hitting something. I love it and I can honestly not believe they can make this for such a good price. Well done!! Thanks for a really fun way to work out!"

What is amazing is there is no pain in the hands while striking targets and still getting the workout. I am almost 70 and very competitive. I love increasing my score every workout and reaching number one! Great stress relief and fabulous coaching too!
256,Sane,Jan 25 at 6:43 PM,4,"Awesome, but there are some things","First, let me start with the fact that the app is AWESOME for cardio! It does its job. Where it falls to the competition are two things. 

- The Level Design - levels are plain ugly compared to Supernatural. They are ugly and depressing.

- The Music - The music is ""serviceable"" at best. Dull, repetitive, and without any character. I'd gladly pay more if there were some hit song packages or options. I don't know how licensing works, but the app would be much more popular and fun if there were an option to ""work out"" on Lady Gaga, Linkin Park, or whatever."
257,Jess,Feb 12 at 2:28 AM,5,Great app!,I love this fitness app! It’s a fun way to get exercise and get your heart rate up.

Nonetheless a great fitness app!"
260,The Beast,Dec 30 at 11:24 PM,5,Great workout app,"I consider myself to be in decent shape and the intense workouts on here leave me sweating hard. I previously used a boxing game to work out on my Quest 2, but I prefer Les Mills because I can stay in one spot so I don’t need to worry about walking into the boundary/wall.

The variety and speed of exercises is good, as is the immersion. The instructors say some cringey things occasionally and it would be nice having some more variety in the soundtrack, but overall this is good value for money and it’s my go to for an 
at home HIIT workout."
261,Stevey,Dec 30 at 2:20 PM,5,Really fun workouts,Love this app.  Both trainers are motivating! The workout are challenging yet doable!  Gets heart rate up without having to workout to long.  I feel good/accomplished even on the shorter workouts!  Keep new things coming. This app is good enough that I have a tough decision between this and supernatural.
262,Paris,Dec 30 at 6:01 PM,5,Cancelled my gym membership,"So happy I found this game. Fell in love at first play. Not only is it a fun way to work out. I find it competitive, makes me feel like I have a personal trainer by my side and I SWEAT! I don’t even sweat during my 60 minute workout at the gym. 

I was excited to see that this game was not subscription based. Working from home I find myself playing this game on every break, love the short 5-7 minute workouts. I typically do 3-4 a day.

268,Drew,Jan 22 at 10:02 PM,5,Excellent workout,"Great exercises with a great soundtrack. The coaches are motivating and the leaderboard drives you to do better to reach the top. Would highly recommend this if you want quick ,  intense workouts."
269,Leeza4,Jan 18 at 3:19 PM,4,Really like this workout !!,"This is an amazing workout that will have you sweating in 5-10 minutes time if you are really trying to hit your targets and get into the rhythm of your shots. For a quick workout, or intense one, you won't be disappointed at all. I was hooked after the 1st day and still at it daily for 1 month so far. Well worth the buy ..... especially when on sale. No subscription required and you can choose whatever works for you each day with keeping tab of your progress and calorie count automatically. A must have in your workout collection. Only reason I haven't given 5 stars is that one of the punches to the outside of my body with both hands doesn't allow me to make contact due to my small frame. I will try to work on correcting that if I am able. This also applies to the knee hits as well. The reach makes you stretch, but I find myself having to jump up all the time to reach the handles."
270,Dan,Dec 28 at 9:29 PM,5,exceptional!,I'm really appreciating how good VR can be for workouts.  Beat Saber and Audio Trip are very good but this one is perfect.  It will put you on the floor in a sweat but with a smile on your face.  The narration is excellent with a good music sound track.  There is also a bit of competition with the 6 other ghost competitors - need that highest score!
271,Jdevlax,Jan 1 at 1:00 AM,5,Best exercise ever !,It’s so fun! You burn a lot of calories. You pick a chill workout or a pass out one lol no subscription for any of the workouts! People do the exercises with you and the music is great! The words from the coaches motivate you. Should cost in the hundreds for all that you get!
272,Jarra,Dec 31 at 7:11 AM,5,I’m loving it!!,4 days playing and I am loving it. Thank you for creating this game that has really one of the best fitness work out VR experience I’ve had. The trainers are good and I I just enjoy the whole experience. I hope it never turns in to a sub based game like other fitness apps. I am so glad I bought this. And I’m excited to help get fitter in the new year 2023.
273,Beatz,Feb 5 at 4:38 PM,3,Great but with issues,"So overall firstly its easily the best fitness app on the quest hands down.

But after a few days use now i noticed a few issues listed below.

In the hub area i can see to the left my stats for the week etc, calories and so on.
When i click on it to open it infront of me the stats show no data on any day. Something isnt working correctly here.

Secondly i had a session doit the rope style movement slamming down both hands to the sides or 1 hand depending on the symbol.
I have no issue wirh rhythm and timing but randomly the slams just wont connect and then you instantly lose your combo. I time it the same everytime as its always on a beat etc but some just dont hit and it frustrating when you also trying to nail every hit.

Im not sure if its due to maybe the controllers going slightly out of view from the headset cameras, if so then maybe the hit location / drum should be raised higher so its slightly in front of you but the motion you do would still be the same slamming to either side of you body.

Just very frustrating when your doing everything correctly but the app / game then says no that was a miss when it clearly wasnt. 

Other then that defo enjoying it i just hope these 2 things can be looked into.

Update Feb 5th.

Jumped back in again and it still isnt showing the stats etc when you open the view. They all show 0.

Sister has also downloaded and started it, 3 routines in, it shows the stats on the menu to the left but when you click it there all 0."
274,Fred Fuerteenelbrazo,Feb 3 at 11:41 AM,5,Simply the best,"No subscription, tons of workouts, rewarding experiences. it would be great a translation to other languages."
275,James,Dec 15 at 3:09 PM,3,"Great App, but there is ongoing issues","Overall it does the job, but there is currently a issue with loading screens not progressing when trying to load some workouts, reinstalling the app etc does not seem to resolve this issue.

Oddly, some workout function as expected but its frustrating when the ones you want to do will not load."
276,Russ,Feb 2 at 4:51 AM,4,LES MILLS BODY COMBAT,This Oculus App is the most complete body workout that includes a high intensity cardio workout that I’ve tried. This app has several levels that will challenge every user regardless of their workout experience.
277,KevY,Jan 25 at 5:53 AM,4,Amazing stuff but need to add options,"The workout itself is awesome and responsive.

After 1 month of playing, the coaching gets repetitive no matter how well or not well you perform. Pls make a way to turn of the coaching voice and maybe even allowing to play our favourite workout tunes ?"
278,Polyglot Gorilla,Dec 29 at 9:16 AM,5,Incredibly motivating,"Sometimes an app comes along in its category that makes you think: they GOT it. And this is it as far as fitness VR goes. A nice quick onboarding with short tutorials, then nothing but really excellent, graded workouts.

283,Brian Sandhu,Feb 2 at 2:45 AM,5,Great cardio workout,As an army solider this game has made doing extra cardio exercises fun and engaging. Nothing like having a fun workout!
284,Mike B,Jan 13 at 4:19 AM,5,Fun competitive workout,This is a workout but also a game.  It is so much fun to play and can be a very tough workout.  I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to burn some calories while having fun doing it.
285,Jalen,Jan 29 at 11:00 PM,5,It's amazing!,It really helps you with your breathing so you don't get winded so easily? You don't wanna pass out in the middle of a fight lol.
286,Azandrew,Jan 30 at 1:09 AM,5,Awesome!,Definitely by far the Best app for working out! And they also add new contents without charging you for a penny. It’s unbelievable of them!
287,wolfknife B,Jan 18 at 12:31 AM,3,No Exit Button,"Oculus button does NOT work to exit.
Must restart headset to get out! Very annoying....

Not the only game to do this.
It's beyond me why such amazing devs would put so much work into a quality product and not put in a simple exit button. As soon as I find out a game doesn't have an exit or oculus button doesn't get me out I return it immediately. Doesn't matter how good the game is. This is my #1 pet peeve about VR games.

Please please please add an exit. Button"
288,Owen,Feb 15 at 2:42 AM,5,,Such a fun workout.
289,TurboFire,Jan 8 at 12:33 AM,5,Les Mills Body Combat,"Love love love. Works up a sweat, gets the heart pumping. Absolutely awesome workout that’s not boring. Definitely recommend. Developers-would be good if the programs you’ve done were flagged in the main menu."
290,Klue,Feb 3 at 2:38 AM,5,Love it!,"Other apps don’t compare! Try it, you’ll like it…..no, you’ll love it!"
291,Steve English,Jan 30 at 1:14 AM,5,Great workout,"Very interacting and a great workout. 
Levels are spot on and intense as you want them to be."
292,Rubacalbas,Jan 18 at 4:27 PM,5,A great work out! Worth it!,"What drew me in was no subscription and I’m glad I made the purchase. New workouts, intensity for different levels, and motivating. I really like it!"
293,Cooke,Jan 9 at 5:32 AM,4,Great workout,I honestly didn't think you could get a full workout with vr but after 2 rounds I was sweating bullets! I enjoy that once you start a game you're in competition with other players. Considering you pay once and not monthly it's definitely worth out. I hope in the future they add more music to the rounds. Basically the same intensity/ level but different combos. I took away one star because there is no exit button to go back to the oculus home screen.
294,Deshon Theo,Feb 4 at 1:01 AM,5,Really good app,My only suggestion is to be able to link to your smart watch
295,Larissa Ione,Oct 1 at 7:09 PM,5,"I HATE Exercise, But I LOVE This","I have never in my life been able to stick with an exercise program because I hate it so much. I’ve tried pretty much everything, including various reward systems for motivation and nothing has ever lasted long. 

Then I got a Quest 2. Between Pistol Whip and Beat Saber I was getting a real workout, but eventually I needed more, so I gave Les Mills Body Combat a try. Holy cow, I love it! For the first time, I don’t dread working out. By the time I’m done, I’m sweating and cursing and breathing hard…and it feels good. 

It’s been years since I’ve seen my waist; inches are melting off. It’s incredible. 

Some advice if you’re an exercise hater like I am: 

Start slow. There are a couple of five-minute workouts, so use those to get yourself used to it. Then go to a ten-minute workout. Then add in one of the short ones. And do the two minute beginner one now and then to work on your form or if you only have a few minutes. 

Don’t do it every day. I love it so much that I overdid it at first. Now I go every other day and it’s a good schedule. You don’t want to burn yourself out, especially if you’re someone who hates exercise and is always looking for an excuse to not do it. 

My only complaint is that I would like a few more workouts added for variety, and it would be great to have a practice mode or session where the instructors demonstrate proper form for the punches. I watched some YouTube videos on basic boxing stances and punches, and it helped but it would be nice to have more of that in the program itself.  (Edited to add that I’m a moron and found tutorials at the bottom of the workout menu. Either I didn’t scroll down enough or they were added later. Either way, yay!)

Overall, this is a fun way to workout, and I’ve definitely seen real progress in weight loss, toning, and stamina. Highly recommended!"
296,SpirosCalisthenics,Jan 31 at 9:00 AM,4,Nice!,"I think in the future is going to be an amazing app. First of all, they need to enable multiplayer mode, needs to add more songs and more movements. Other than that, its very good."
297,Alisa,Jan 1 at 10:33 PM,2,Glitchy,It doesn’t properly register all of my hits when I KNOW I’ve hit the target perfectly. Not sure if it’s the game developers or the Quest developers who are to blame but regardless it makes it far less enjoyable to play.
298,ButtahKhan,Jan 6 at 3:08 AM,4,My Favorite !!!,"As of right now, this is my favorite game on the
Oculus. Whether it's five or twenty-five
minutes, your blood is sure to be pumping after
a workout. I can get a quick one in during my
lunch break. Or do it throughout the day on the
weekends.
I love this game and the trainers are endearing.
I just have one problem with the controls. To
get punches to register, you have to flick your
wrist up in such a way that has your palm facing
outward. This isn't a punch, this is a palm. I have
to awkwardly whip my punches for it to register."
299,syn,Dec 14 at 10:47 AM,3,Great app....,"....in general if not since a short time, several trainings are not loading anymore and show the spinning Loading circle forever. Seems to actually get worse. Sometimes it helps to kill the app and restart, but not always. Really annoying with the already slow loading time. Please fix this soon, so I can adjust my rating."
300,Lady Dee,Jan 6 at 6:24 AM,4,,"This is a great work-out,  the only thing that I feel would take this app to the next level would be to add co-op. I can see this app being number 1 hands down it fitness with the co-op option. Great visual and easy to follow along. 👌"
301,Humberto,Jan 5 at 6:00 PM,5,Amazing work guys!,"Although at first i has trouble setting up, once everything worked fines it's amazing.. the perfect app for excercising at Home.. keep working hard, You have My full support.. 5 stars"

303,Cecelia,Jan 22 at 9:30 PM,5,Awesome!,This is an awesome workout app that gets funner as you advance up the levels. Well worth the purchase.
304,ApplePirate,Jan 3 at 7:54 AM,4,Pretty solid workout for off days,I use this on my off days and weekends to get my heart rate up. I could definitely see this as a great app for people new to exercise. One complaint is the rapid jab cross hit detection seems off and causes me to drop down the leaderboard. Everyone else’s score seems unaffected tho so I’m probably doing something wrong. Still a solid workout even if I’m salty for not getting 1st place
305,Barbie,Jan 23 at 3:45 AM,5,Great app,I love this app! Its a great workout and a lot of fun. It's also really straightforward to use
306,CLouise Pitchford,Jan 24 at 2:24 AM,5,,One of the best workouts so far. If you’re looking for a good sweat well this is it.
307,Namrebyc,Dec 31 at 3:37 PM,5,Had this a while and its very good,I like this game a lot but I struggle to keep motivated I like the challenge among the randoms but would be better if you could have a core of people you know or add to play with to motivate each other
308,Pix,Jan 12 at 7:46 PM,5,Full on,"Had this app for a couple of days and it’s one that I will now use everyday, love the workouts and certainly delivers.

312,Pittstop,Sep 13 at 2:05 AM,5,Worth the Sweat !!!,"You want a work out…..This is it. 
Want to lose calories… This is it.

I purchased this game to work on my cardio and to stay fit. Well, be careful what you ask for. 

This game had me drinched in sweat. The simple work out or the starter work out. My heart rate increases that’s how I know I was getting a good start on my work day exercise.  I admit I had to slowly slow down and drink water.  I have a goal to loose 15-20lbs and this game here will be it.  The trainer on the set keeps you going to push through and I love it.  

This game is not like Beat Sabers far from it. 
This game have you moving like your in the ring boxing with a twist . So be ready for the sweating.

Ohhh before I forget make sure you breathe this game will keep you busy with cardio punching, ducking, swatting,bobbin and weaving and knee lifting. 

The price for this work out is 1 time fee far less than 
 a personal trainer and you don’t have to pay monthly fee a WIN -WIN

You want a work out THIS IS IT!!! 
Have your water ready!!!"

315,sleepypants,Jan 9 at 4:59 PM,5,Very well done,"I used to box and think this is a great VR translation for fitness. My hooks needed adjustment to score in the app. A proper short hook doesn't register as much as a looking hook but this is a fitness app, not boxing training. That said the straights, body and upper cuts pop as if you would shadow box. Love it as it has got me off the sofa and back into fitness. I also love that is not a subscription. I highly recommend it."
316,Viatrixadastra,Jan 28 at 6:06 PM,5,Actual workout!,Fantastic app! Best workout app out there!
317,Asa,Nov 2 at 5:04 PM,5,Praise + Dev feedback,"Amazing app. I use it every day and see the results. If you want to get in shape, download it and don’t look back.

Feedback for Devs:
- The voice control activation button should be B, not A—it’s too easy to press by accident and it’s very distracting because the targets are 3 feet away but the voice icon pops up in 2D right in front of my eyes and throws off my depth perception.
- The new combo effect of vibration is also very distracting and discombobulating. My controllers should only vibrate when I connect with a target—I completely lose track of what’s going on and start missing targets when my controllers start randomly vibrating for 5 seconds. Same for the light ray flowing from the combo wheel to my hands—totally distracting and confusing. A combo isn’t worth much if I lose it right away because of how I’m notified. The “explosion” and filter overlay are more than enough for me to know I’m getting a combo.
- it’s unclear what the performance percentage is at the end of the workout. Is it a combination of my speed and power? Is it how many targets I hit or miss? Would be great to see an explanation in-app and also a live tracker during the workout, right below the workout timer/combo wheel.


Thank you for your work on this stellar app!"

326,NefariousLight,Jan 16 at 6:33 AM,4,Worth a try,The workouts are pretty fun and there are many different options to keep things interesting. Also you don't have to subscribe which makes this game a much better option then the competition
327,Lucas Lyons,Jan 7 at 8:04 PM,5,I LOVE THIS,"I got the VR for my son for Christmas but bought this app for me. Haven't been off its since Christmas day, my son isn't happy. Great exercise great music, I just love it 👍👌"
328,Deanna,Dec 30 at 5:29 AM,3,Not like the classes but good workout,"I downloaded this app expecting it to be similar to my beloved BodyCombat classes at the gym. I was hoping for almost 3D instructor-led releases, new and old. This is not that. 

Short clips anywhere from 8-20 mins long with a few tracks each. The music isn’t as good as the live classes. There’s no visible instructor modeling the moves but the instructor is in your ear. No virtual mirror to track your form but you can see your shadow at times. Targets move towards you and you punch them. I don’t quite understand the scoring but it seems you get points for not missing targets and hitting harder. It ranks you against others that have done the clip. 

Despite being disappointed that my expectations were not met, perhaps that’s on me for having expectations in the first place. It was a very good workout and 3-4 clips in a row really got me sweating. I haven’t done a lot of fitness VR apps yet but it really seems like a good workout."
329,Teressa Harris,Jan 14 at 4:10 PM,5,With a back injury Wow! Amazing!,"I LOVE this app! I am a nurse who had a 400+ lbs patient use me as a crutch as I was bent over removing her bedside commode. That herniated two disks in my back with sciatic nerve consequences.  Needless to say working out to stay healthy has been more than a challenge...BUT I can workout with this app and get my heart range to 165-180!  This is without creating any residual pain issues! I have to watch body mechanics-yes! But the instructors give you information on the correct body mechanics.  I use this app 2,3, and sometimes even 4x a day! LOVE IT! I would like to be able ro use my index or my oculus though. My quest two can have tracking ""lags"" on occasion. Because it is exclusive Quest 2 game I can not use my computer to help it along. Still I love this app!

3 months later and I have lost 10% body fat and my son played it once and purchased his own Quest 2 just to  He's a college kid, full time worker and has timing issues for the gym.. not now! I take my logs to the doctor's with me! It feels great being proactive!"
330,Rogmocrypta,Dec 29 at 10:02 PM,5,Great app,"Really fun app, very reasonable price (thank goodness its not subscription) and the ability to be competing vs other people really gives that extra motivational push."
331,Yomi,Dec 31 at 2:30 AM,5,Great!!!!! I love it!!!,"I have been going in and out of membership at gyms with the dropping out within a few weeks. With the cold season I hate getting up in the morning, warming the car going to go workout with people that done even interact with you, driving back and then rushing back to shower to get out the door to work. With this I get a killer workout…”soaked in sweat” and in the comfort of my own home. My new addiction and I absolutely love it!!!!"
332,LOKK,Jan 1 at 8:52 AM,4,Great app,"Fun workouts and no monthly fee is awesome. The workouts are engaging and have the perfect intensity for any skill level. My only gripe is that it doesn’t really sense the kneeing well. Hopefully, it’s just a timing thing on my end. Other than that, completely worth it"
333,Loren,Jan 17 at 12:36 AM,5,Absolutely the best 👌,Best workout app. You can choose difficulties and do as much u like 👍
334,Boardmae,Nov 24 at 6:30 PM,2,"Great potential, but needs work.","The idea behind the app, the locations and coaching are all highlights as far as I’m concerned.  

The problems begin with poor hand tracking.  The number of times that I’ve watched my hand quickly move through the very center of a target and my streak broken was rather ridiculous.  This leads me to the next issue: no hand speed or movement monitor with which to judge whether adjustments needed.  I’m sorry, but solely relying on exploding rings is trash.  

The final issue I ran into was the menu and settings availability.  I’m colorblind, so I thought it was possible that I may have missed a couple of targets due to this, only to find that locating a useful settings menu wasn’t going to happen.  Along the same line of thought, the rear section of the targets is dark colored, often making it difficult to determine the type of strike quickly enough.  The whole target should be easily identifiable, brightly colored, and have colorblindness options easily available.

As the title says, it has a lot of potential.  The positives are very positive, but the negative issues I’ve addressed make it virtually unusable.  Until updates are made, I’m sticking with FitXR."
335,Roy,Nov 9 at 4:15 AM,5,Wow. Just... WOW.,"I've only had my Quest 2 about 2 weeks - this is only the third or fourth title I've purchased, but once upon a time I was a videogame journalist, and I've owned just about every console going, so I know my games, and I know what I like. 
This was bought more-or-less on a whim to give me something different to do than play Res Evil 4 (which I'm on my third run-through - bloody awesome game) and because my wife is always banging on about Les Mills fitness, so I thought I'd see what all the fuss was about. 
I've just done the tutorial and three sessions, and I'm absolutely shattered! And as someone who runs roughly 6 miles every other day I thought I was fit! But most importantly: it didn't even feel like exercise - it's like THE most satisfying rhythm-action game ever! I can't remember the last time I picked up a game that was so instantly addictive!
This may seem like a snap judgment, and indeed, I tend to frown on those who play a game for about 10 mins and then rush to rate it, but in this case, it's apparent from the off that this game does exactly what it should, it's perfectly balanced and I think it genuinely WILL get me fitter, particularly with the amount that I intend to play it. 
Okay, so I'm not going to be playing it for HOURS at a time, like, say the PS5 masterpiece Horizon Forbidden West, but this isn't that type of game: it's the kind of game you pick up when you've got 15 or 20 mins to spare and just want an instant adrenaline hit, and for that: it's perfection (to be honest, it's so magnificently exhausting that I don't think I COULD play it for hours at a time anyway!)
The only real problem I've got with this game now is that if my wife gets hold of it and tries it out, I'll probably never get my Quest back!"
336,Christian Robert Schulz,Feb 8 at 1:06 PM,3,"Could be the best, but instead...","The app could be great if it weren't for the completely unnecessary multiplayer compulsion! With every exercise you are ""connected"" with other people and put under psychological pressure with a leaderboard right in front of your face. There is a way to turn this off, but finding the options menu is very difficult since it's hidden somewhere in your profile. On top you get completely wrong comments like ""oh you climb right up"" when you went to the last position. For me THE reason to stay with FitXR instead! 

Furthermore it is not possible to skip the boring introductions. I.e. at the beginning you get about 7 minutes of chewing your ear off with totally superfluous drivel about self-explanatory exercises. Dear developers: to include something like this is OK, but please give us the possibility to skip it! And dear social media supports: Please don't try to fool us by claiming you can't skip the explanations due to ""loading"". This devalues the skills of your developers, and no one will believe you."
337,Patti,Oct 3 at 8:36 PM,5,Best VR Fitness App on Oculus,"I'm a 63 year old woman who was told I need to exercise more.  I found FitXR last year and loved the boxing playing most days of the week until I found Les Mills a few weeks ago and decided to try something different.  This one is even better!  Much better upper and lower body workouts and I feel my core getting stronger every day.   The trainers are great, encouraging and I love their accents.  I love it so much that I haven't even gone back to the FitXR.   I just hope the Dev's can keep adding new workouts.  This App is perfect for all ages and ability levels.   :)"
338,Thomas,Oct 8 at 9:33 PM,5,I'm a believer!!!,"***Update: raised the rating from one star back to five stars. Took a lot of time and practice, but finally figured out how to do the knee strikes. This is my go-to fitness app, the best I've ever used on the Quest 2***

I've tried so many fitness apps and deleted all of them, settling for Pistol Whip and Beat Saber. Then I stumbled upon this app and decided to purchase it after reading all of the great reviews. I had huge doubts I'd like it and after paying full price, figured I'd be refunding after a few hours. Well I'm happy to say that I LOVE THIS APP! First of all, thank you for making this a full pay option without a subscription. I think many of us appreciate that. We don't need to pay a monthly fee to use it. I have played (or worked out) 3 days in a row for 30 to 45 minutes. The first day I was so sore I could barely bend my body. I consider myself a fairly healthy individual, but I needed a good cardio workout that got my heart pumping. This did that and more. I started at low intensity, and did a few medium intensities, but that was a little too much for a start. So for now, I'm focusing on the low intensity workouts, which I am loving. I'm looking forward to my body and cardio climatizing so I can move into some of the more difficult workouts. I love the two trainers, the motivating speak is lots of fun, although a little repetitive. But I don't really care so much about what they are saying as I do about hitting the targets and getting a good boxing workout. I think that's why I love this app so much, because of the boxing aspect which I really enjoy. Hitting is a great stress reliever! The only feedback I can offer, is to continue adding more sessions to the app and include a playlist feature. Playlists would be an awesome addition and allow me to cycle through my favorite workouts in succession without stopping. Thanks for a terrific, fun, workout that I know I will stick with. This is now one of my top three apps!"

Also there is no option to disable a voiceover. This is rather fitness game than boxing fun. I would recommend to watch some gameplay videos on YouTube before buying. I was very disappointed."
342,Ben,Nov 28 at 11:45 PM,5,Amazing addition to my routine,"Weather is getting colder so I wanted some indoor cardio. Wow. I have taken some of the boxing classes on Apple Fitness and my Tempo. But having a beat to follow and targets to hit makes this version a sweat fest. Not to mention amazing fun. At first I thought the coaches were cheesy, but they also add to the experience. And one last thing that took it to the next level for me was the leaderboard. Get this, you won’t regret it."

 Fast-forward a new career and a move to the middle of nowhere NY. For 5 years I did minimal exercise.  Let me tell you that when I say this VR is exactly as an actual class, I mean it.

 I purchased it today, downloaded it,and spent a sweaty 2 hour workout that I will feel for sure tomorrow!! 

Love Love Love 💕"
348,Matthew,17 days ago,1,Just wasn’t for me,"Tried it out tonight. And unfortunately this one just isn’t for me. 

Music isn’t really my style. Felt a little generic. 
Not being able to skip the slow tutorial drive me a little (and by a little I mean I was telling the nice man to hurry the f up) crazy but I get it. It is necessary. 

The speed of the targets was excruciating. I jumped right to intermediate level and it honestly felt like I could have put the headset down go grab some water, and file my taxes before the next target showed up. (Exaggeration of course) I lasted maybe 4 minutes into my first workout and felt like I was wasting my time. And yes that really isn’t enough time to get the true experience. But even beat saber get the blood flowing in the few seconds. 

Now while I gave it 1 star. That’s just MY experience. I do think this is a great intro to VR fitness. Don’t be like me and do your research before you buy. 

I will try it again in a few months and will adjust my review accordingly."

351,Queen B,Dec 3 at 5:43 PM,5,Best fitness app!,I tried 2 other fitness/ boxing apps over the last year. They were static and didn’t involve the whole body. I never lost weight with them. I have used this app for a week and lost 4 pounds. I’m sore all over and I know I’m working my whole body.

1st day - 10/24... I started to use the game. It was a very interesting first experience. I ended up sweating like never before by doing only like 20 minutes. I wen through 4 light activities of 5 minutes. I had to take plenty of rest time between the 4 ""sets"" as they are very intense. Burned 132Kcal only but I have to work on my form, specially the knee movements which are tricky as most reviewers have said before."
353,Gaav,Nov 30 at 12:35 PM,5,Must buy!,I never really believed in fitness VR games and i saw some that were subscription based. But this one had some good reviews and peaked my interest. It's really hard sometimes! In a good way. The workouts can be intense and the gameplay is really good and clear. If u need a fitness game get this one!

356,Casanova17,Mar 1 at 4:35 AM,5,Better than other apps,"I just got this app today and I haven’t stopped playing. I had other subscription workout apps but hated paying for a subscription so I decided to try body combat. So many work outs and so many levels. Very easy to play and understand and a lot of phone. More realistic and less animated too. Try it!!

357,SenorClay,Jul 21 at 7:58 AM,5,"Skip the subscriptions, get fit","I looked heavily into this and Supernatural. When it comes to working out I want a challenge and more of gym style layout. Supernatural has all the frills, modern popular music that they pick for you (you can't pick it), and you can do yoga, meditation, and other various workouts with many different ""celebrity"" trainers that will tell you all about their life story. It's also pretty focused on social issues. Les Mills is right to the basics with challenging workouts in virtual gyms with proprietary music tracks and trainers that stick to nothing but the workout, giving you tips, and coaching. The best part about LM is that you buy it once and it's yours. Supernatural is $20 a month! I like to workout to escape the calamity of everything in the world and get fit so Les Mills is hands down better to me."

365,nostrace,Dec 14 at 11:15 PM,4,Great potential!,"Despite its competition, it's a workout app that has great potential to be one of the best. The simple fact that it doesn't have a monthly subscription puts it way ahead. 

The exercise are efficient, nice graphics and the online aspect keeps it competitive if you're into it. Coaches are nice also. Focused on explaining rather than act like an influencer. 

App is not perfect tho and could use some improvements. Such as (personally): 

- UI revamp.
Divide training intensity with tabs.
Show exercises in vertical inside those tabs.

- Non combat workouts. 
Squat oriented workouts would be great.
Not needing to always use your hands to punch something, but rather to lightly touch a spot that confirms a movement. 

But overall, great app!"

367,Jonathan Zulkeski,Dec 10 at 3:19 AM,3,BoxVR v2,"If this wasn't made by the same devs as the defunct Box VR (now Fit XR), well it's insanely close with some added moves.

The game has a good feel, but in my experience the uppercuts (uppercuts only) on the Quest Pro are wildly inaccurate. I could see my punches going through targets and instead of exploding, they would break and reset my streaks. *Exceptionally* frustrating; enough to make me not want to use the app. I was hitting the other targets with 100% accuracy."

370,Ashworthkent74,Oct 23 at 5:34 PM,5,4 months everyday so far,This is a great program and I highly recommend it. You will not hate working out. It is fun and can meet any fitness level . My only wish was that there was a room where you could select the punches you wanted to work on and perfect before going into a workout. I have never hit 90 on any workout and would like to practice outside the actual workout. Wouldn't give less than 5 stars as is. I have been doing the workout everyday for over 4 months straight. I have never stuck with ANY program before. Don't hesitate any longer!

I decided to buy this app and no doubt this app does what it says it will and delivers very well. It’s easy to get lost and forget your recovery from Covid when there’s a instructor ￼voice leading the way. They implement a lot of squats￼, which is super tiresome and gets your heart racing face. The graphics are great. The only complaint I have is I wish there was more verity when it comes to music and backgrounds. 
If they can implement a feature to change the scenery to be more nature, that would be incredible. Also, why not have some training sessions where you’re actually go against an AI ￼"

389,Teresa Whittington,Feb 15 at 9:07 PM,5,Thankful and Love it!,So thankful to have this lesmill program on VR! It’s definitely an asset to a healthier/exercise lifestyle. Having instructors in privacy of your own home with so many options in upper and lower body for strengthening and changing body composition. Also helps get my coordination better with using targets as markers. I have hope of becoming stronger and healthier applying the techniques in this App. Very appreciative as I wake up looking forward to exercise!

392,Albert,Nov 6 at 11:08 AM,5,2 weeks in and really enjoying this.,"I had to decide between going to a class or trying out my VR headset with a suitable fitness app. Like everything you learn how to ‘play’ the game the more you use it. The knee action takes patience but when you get it the benefit is clear of doing it right. I think there are some improvements possible like playing with friends, more instruction on the technique’s for each punch as the hip and legwork is a little tricky to master, possibly ditch the controllers as they are just a distraction and get sweaty.  I’m very happy and this 4* + app can be 5 in future. If the subs are fair and the content keeps coming then they could have a good thing going here.

Upgraded to 5* because it I’m still here after many month. It’s a sure fire 350Kcal burn in 25 minutes and builds flexibility, strength, it tones and motivates. I also join the odd Les Mills class at the local gym now and both compliment each other well."
393,Csaba,Nov 6 at 1:15 AM,5,Best VR workout,"Les mills bodycombat is without doubt my favourite VR workout. It is an exhilarating workout, after which I always feel great.

405,Charbie the Doll,Nov 5 at 8:13 PM,4,Good….but,"So far, I like it… I get bored very easily—but this game manages to keep my attention.

However, I have two critiques. 

One area, knee boarding, crashes and won’t open. This is important, because it teaches you how to do that particular move.

And even though we are supposed to be able to see our streaks, nothing registers... which can be demotivating if you are motivated by progress."
406,Shocks,Aug 11 at 4:06 AM,5,Great Fitness App - 2nd to Supernatural,"Probably the best non-subscription based Fitness App on the Oculus store. The workouts are top notch (maximizing burning calories while toning muscles), and that's why you should buy it.

But the good pretty much ends there. No warm ups, no cool down sessions, no meditation sessions, no full body exercise sessions, no top music tracks, no massive selection of environments, no switching back between flow and Boxing; and because of this the fun factor isn't in the same realm as Supernatural. 

That said, of course you cant blame em for not having the same level of features as a subscription based app, but its worth noting the differences between the 2.

I fully recommend Les Mills Bodycombat; it's what I currently use for my VR fitness needs. It has workouts that are on par with Supernatural (maximizing burning calories while toning muscles), maybe even a little better. So if you're wanting an inexpensive workout app, Les Mills is it. But if Supernatural ever released a cheaper plan, I may go back to them.

PS - I mainly used Supernatural Boxing, which is the most similar in workout intensity to BodyCombat"

411,bkcs,Oct 30 at 4:34 AM,5,Good workouts!,"I have tried a variety of workout VR apps. As a 50 yr old male, my primary agenda is to find a suitable app that can keep my heart going, and (pant… pant… pant… please Rachel.. gasp.. no more… need water!) this is it. When I first started I thought I was in reasonable shape. Ehh, I was wrong. My shoulders and abs are pretty sore after trying an intermediate workouts. My shirt was drenched. Highly recommended for those who want a serious workout in whatever time they can allot. Even if you’re strapped for time, there are some 5-10 minute workouts just to get you moving a bit. Thanks to the devs for putting out a killer cardio app. Good stuff.

EDIT: it’s the next day. My legs and abs are still killing me. Yeah, this is a good workout. Save yourself the gym membership money. This is good."

I was happy to see familiar Dan and Rach as the trainers.  It's a fun and challenging cardio workout.  It has workouts that are different durations and intensity levels.  If you're competitive, there's a live leaderboard during your session that pushes you to try for first place.  It's very satisfying when you do.  This game gets my heart racing and I'm dripping in sweat everytime!!  New workouts are always being added so it gives a variety.  I see this as being my go to cardio workout for a long time.  Thank you Les Mills!!!"

Confused as to why. But still a five star! What a way to kick your butt!"
431,Tay Bug,Aug 12 at 3:19 AM,5,Everything I was looking for!,"So I have been relentlessly seeking exercise apps since getting my Quest 2. This is the app I finally found that truly hit all of my needs - including that I did not want to pay for a subscription. I have literally been looking forward to my workouts every day -- which is huge considering I could barely find motivation for 15 minutes of activity per day before. Meanwhile I'm happily exercising daily for full a full hour on this app 😅 There are many apps I've tried that superficially seem similar to this one, but Les Mills BodyCombat is farrrrr superior in both big details and small.

Big details:
1) I sweat SO MUCH, my muscles have been fantastically sore every single day and I haven't even tried the highest intensity workouts yet, plus no weird or bad pains since the coaches do actually mention form a lot during the workouts which helps me keep my posture correct. (the coaching audio is optional, as well, if you prefer!)

2) workouts actually include leg movements other than the repetitive squats nearly every app relies on (currently just the knee hits, yes, but it makes a big difference and I'm hoping they eventually add other leg interactive moves!)

3) the dopamine I get from getting bigger explosive reactions depending on my hit force/accuracy is integral to my adhd brain finding exercise rewarding lol -- the sound and animations are really great AND there's a subtle noise for when you miss but it doesn't like throw a red screen or make a harsh/disparaging noise which is perfect for me and anyone who responds to positive reinforcement but not negative reinforcement.

Small details:
1) The trainers actually record entire sessions so each workout has its own coaching specific to the workout -- love this so much. Much more helpful than hearing the same ""great job!"" over and over again every workout.

2) The variety per workout is really well balanced, so even though there are only x number of moves, I always feel challenged because of the way the workouts are composed.

3) Something about the height calibration or angles of impact that the visuals require (or both!) really forces you to use better form to complete the workouts - compared to every other app I've tried especially.

Wishlist:
1) More leg moves! :)) maybe something that involves jumping or even just bouncing side to side?

2) it would be really neat to workout to my own music sometimes, since I know the songs that pump me up the best lol

3) different environments would also be cool, just to add some variation.

4) Some sort of stretching/warm up/cooldown would be so so huge and helpful. I am notoriously bad at doing those for myself so it would be cool to be able to add it to the start/end of my workout in-app so I can hold myself accountable.

In conclusion, this app is dope and you should absolutely get it if you're looking for a boxing/kickboxing type workout that isn't repetitive or buggy. Hats off to the devs and the coaches, y'all have done a great job!"
432,Rusty007,Dec 9 at 6:02 PM,5,Thanks For Keeping Me Fit,Congrats on the best app for 2022... keep up the great work.
433,JC Denton,Jul 3 at 7:46 PM,5,Les Mills vs Thrill of the fight.,"If you use your oculus (meta?🙄) primarily for fitness, then stop reading and buy this game. As a reasonably fit and healthy male (military), I still get a good sweat from a short session. So if you're average or unfit, this will 💯 make u shed some weight and tone some muscle. 

I think thrill of the fight is one of the best fitness games on the quest. However, this has many advantages over TOTF. 
1.  It requires far less space to use. In TOTF, you need good space to fully benefit. 
2. You need longer fights for more efficient workout in TOTF. But your fights can finish quicker than you want even at higher difficulties. So you must be disclipined to decide to spend at least 20-30 mins in app.  With this app, you can easily choose a workout with a good duration (30+ mins) and just ride it out! 
3. It is more time efficient than TOTF. This is because you can choose an intense workout with a short time and get a decent workout. TOTF can be intense but its hard to control fight duration as I said. 
4. You need strong self  motivation to get the most out of TOTF and punch hard, move etc so if you're lazy or unmotivated, you won't benefit much. You can stand around and throw few punches. This game however will force you to punch and squat even if you don't want to. That's a huge advantage because even if you start getting tired, you will still push through. So its like having a PT forcing you to carry on. In TOTF, you can unconsciously slow down as you tire. 
5. You don't have to like boxing or fighting to enjoy this game unlike TOTF. Also this is more female friendly as there are no female boxers in TOTF. 

Complaints from others:  Some people complain about the coaching/motivation from the digital in game trainers/coaches. They either don't like it (turn it off then) or say it's not accurate or personal enough. I think expecting accuracy of the voice over is asking for too much. If you are serious about getting in shape or being fit, you need self motivation. No one can motivate you to get in good shape. It's down to you. That said, I think the voice over does a good job of keeping you motivated enough to complete the workout if you accept that  its not a real coach and don't take it too seriously. Personally, I like it and think their jokes are funny too. Devs, improve it if you want but don't dare reduce or cut it out! 

Another complaint is that the leaderboard element of it is demoralising. Once again, turn it off if it bothers you. However, I'll say no fit person  got in good form by being cuddled. Personally, I think if you find yourself at the bottom despite your best efforts, let that be a reminder of your current fitness level and let that be enough motivation for you to keep going until you get the the top of the board someday. How about that? Also don't be a snowflake and take it too seriously. No one truly cares. Enjoy the workout and get fitter. 

Is this game perfect? Prob not. No game is. But it looks good on the eye,  audio is good and mechanics is good. Buy it and get fit! There's no subscription and devs have promised to keep all the current content accessible even if they add a subscription later. And the current content is already a lot and sufficient. Buy it. 9.5/10. The end."
434,ThatOtherGuy,Feb 5 at 4:49 AM,5,Best Fitness Game for Quest,"I've played all the fitness games, this is the best - it has everything I'd want in a fitness game. What I love most is is the coaching feature and the variety of excercises that feel cathartic, smooth and provide an intence full body workout."
435,Luke,Nov 27 at 2:20 PM,5,Absolutely incredible,"I don't know how they managed to make this so perfect but I'd like to, flawless, the best workout!"
436,Miriam Wilson,Nov 3 at 12:50 AM,5,Great Cardio,"Very motivating app, they hype you up and push you to finish your workout. It’s great so far, the updates are awesome too. You don’t have to pay a subscription and they change the workouts and add new ones frequently."
437,IronGwaziFan,Oct 16 at 3:33 PM,5,Best fitness app on Oculus HANDS DOWN!,"Wow! I've tried just about every fitness-based app out there for Quest. Of course, they are all variations of the same thing, hit/grab/pull the shapes/objects that are flying towards you.  Some apps do this better than others. Most have their strong points and weak points. Les Mills Bodycombat is the first app that has put it ALL together.  So far, I have yet to find a weakness.  This delivers the best workouts I have ever had on Quest.  I go to the gym most days but the day after my first Les Mills workout my entire body was so sore, I could barely move!  

Supernatural is a great app as well, but the subscription-based service was a deal breaker for me.  Thank God it was, because Les Mills delivers a better overall experience for a one-time fee!  If you are looking for an app to get you in shape in VR your search is over! BUY THIS NOW!"
438,Jules,Jan 23 at 3:02 PM,5,Fantastic fitness app,"Oh man, if I could give this app more stars, I would! It’s great! 🥳

💵 www.oculus. com/appreferrals/Jules7of9/4015163475201433/ 

(No spaces needed, but the review would not submit without separating the full stops in the link 😬)

I’m so out of shape since having my third bub and not rock climbing through covid. I was hoping this app would be as good as the reviews because I needed encouragement to get my head back in the game. 

Les Mills BodyCombat is high energy and exciting. I can feel my muscles are being worked in the right ways. I love how the instructors keep pushing me to fight and hit the targets harder. I love the fun way they integrate their support, and guidance into the workout. It honestly feels like they are right there challenging me to do and be better! 

Do yourself a solid and buy this app. It’s worth the money and no subscription fees!! Win win 🏆 

My only feedback would be that those knee hits are hard as 😂 I think I’ve hit 5 in the several hundred I’ve attempted 🤣🤣🤣✌️✌️"
439,Shay Hamidou,Jun 4 at 7:35 PM,5,Les Mills For Life,"I bought the 1 yr Supernatural Subscription last year in Nov 2021 right before it went on sale and it was a nice fun game. It has beautiful scenery and a huge massive variety of music and trainers to motivate you. My heart rate never went higher than about 85 and my resting heart rate is about 62 on average. So for me it was NOT exercise but just something fun to do 3-4 times a week. 

When I saw that Les Mills was being released in Feb 2022, I purchased it the very first day! “Stand and Deliver!” … I have the old school DVD’s from Beach Body for Les Mills which I love but this is so the next level of greatness for them. Dan and Rachel are amazing and I love that I can just silence their voices and kill the competition section and just focus on working out. My heart rate hit 165 last night for the first time ever! I hit 1.6 million for a 25 min workout! That is insane but I felt amazing! 

I have been hitting up Body Combat 5-6 days a week for months now and sadly I have not even opened up Supernatural in the past 3 months. Yes Supernatural is nice and a perfect alternative if you are a Beats Sabor fan and don’t want to pay for each song one by one. But for me it is not enough of a workout to get me where I want to be. I have it until Nov so I will keep it and use a few of the routines like the Disney ones and Show Tunes. But when Les Mills released the new workouts a few weeks ago, it just recharged me to push harder and I absolutely love all the new variety and moves! 

Remember that you can always try any game / app out for 2 weeks to just see if you like it or not and then decide for yourself. But for me, 5 yrs ago I was 489lbs and today I am at 218 heading towards my goal of 175lbs. I am 100% Les Mills For Life!"

442,Samii Nicole,Jan 22 at 7:59 PM,5,Finally!!,I absolutely love this! I workout with YouTube workouts at home and lately I’ve gotten bored with it. I searched for fitness games on my quest but only found lame ones or ones that require subscriptions. This one is a one time purchase! Plus it’s so fun! I have trainers beside me helping the every step of the way and it’s just motivating. Absolutely love this and I recommend this to anyone looking to workout and have fun at the same time!!!!
443,Terry,Jan 22 at 10:06 AM,5,Just started out on day 1,"Well put together fitness app. After the intro and 1st level you feel that this is a bit easy, well thought out. Look around at the scenery la la la. Then you go up a level and start sweating a little. Quick glances every few seconds to the right as your name starts moving about on the scoreboard. Topped it, next level. Not so easy now you keep glancing over, your name is going up and down more than a Spanish couple on honeymoon. Done it. Next level , arms getting a bit tired now, throwing punches around like a drunk as you're encouraged to hit 65 in a row left,right,left,right. Big finish. Best have a sit down, you end up congratulating the others that finish above you they can't hear you but you do it all the same. Gotta get to the top again, one more go and that's it for today.... I really am not that fit, that's the cardio done I feel like going for a run. Maybe tomorrow, it's snowing outside."
444,JP,Jan 7 at 10:57 AM,5,Best yet,I’m glad I read the reviews and made the purchase. What a great way to do a workout and it really does work you out. The trainers are great and keep me going. The best fitness for VR I’ve come across.
445,mureka,Nov 26 at 12:45 PM,4,Great app,"I like boxing, really like this app as well, congrats. The only thing I miss is some warm up, and cool down sessions."
446,Justin,Nov 23 at 2:40 AM,5,I love it.,It's give me more energy when i join in and after my work out I never been  Motivated before
447,Lindsay Qualls,Oct 29 at 11:06 AM,5,Just what I was looking for!,"If you’re thinking about it, DO IT! I love this game so far. Not only is it a great workout (I’m sore everywhere), but it’s also a blast! Super happy with my purchase and so excited to keep going. So addicting!"
448,AJ,Nov 7 at 5:05 AM,4,Broken… me not the app,"Not one for reviews on games but been hunting for something fitness related. Was enjoying Ragnarock but felt a bit limited on movement.

About 6/7 sessions in, tried a medium level one and it destroyed me, loved it.

Struggling a bit with knee strikes - about a 25% strike rate - starts ok but when the arms get tired!

The fact it works offline, doesn’t require a subscription is brilliant. So far very happy

Edit: love the app still and the knees are much better after practice - reason for the reduction is the limitations offline. Seems like cannot access favourites list or add any work outs to it.

I see profiles can be used online but not offline as well and given work and the reason to have a mobile fitness app is partly for the offline experience it does let it down for me. Otherwise still think it’s the best app I own for fitness."
449,Marta,Oct 12 at 6:39 PM,5,highly addictive and hard,"I didn't trust fitness games, but this one has changed my mind completely.  Supernatural movements, personalized training by levels and with super-motivating monitors.  
I am hooked!  
I think it's addictive for any level,  those who have never done body combat or the les mills instructor's.
I LOVE IT!
The new updated is awesome! Nee movés, new intensity, wondeful!"

451,Broon,Oct 19 at 7:57 PM,5,Brilliant,"￼I really like this app. You can choose different levels and different times. I am just starting to exercise again and this app is ideal for building up a routine. I prefer competition, so to be competing against other live players is perfect. Well worth it!!"
452,Tiramisu,Dec 10 at 4:15 AM,3,Question with knee combo,I like this app but I can never get points when grabbing the thing and hitting with me knee.  What am I doing wrong?
453,Chris,Jan 18 at 7:49 AM,5,Best Fitness Title By Far,"Full disclosure I live in Japan so “that other title” is unavailable to me. However I couldn’t be more than happy with my purchase. Purchase being the key word here. I paid for the app and now I own it as it should be. There are rumors swirling around that les mills plans to introduce a subscription feature, if that happens In out. I would however be more than happy to shell out money on DLC it’s that good. The coaches are fantastic the the competition aspect of the leader boards is a nice touch, something the other aforementioned app wussed out on and tossed in the trash. The music is serviceable and matches the hits, you aren’t going to be hearing this years top 10 but that’s not why your here. This is a combat fitness app and doesn’t try to be anything else. I respect that."
454,Pickle,Oct 11 at 9:41 PM,5,Les mills,I do Les mills body combat at my gym but due to work commitments I struggle to get every week .. I purchased Les mills for my meta quest 2 … absolutely fantastic .. well worth the money … great trainers and loads of different classes .. just love doing it .. especially trying to get to the top of leader board .. which I did !!
455,Pedro,Oct 31 at 10:33 PM,4,Almost perfect,"Just won't give 5 stars as some of the tracking needs work, particularly on fast jab/cross transitions, which sometimes make for a frustrating experience. Knees were also a problem but I found a way to make them work. 

Otherwise it's a great game that makes me sweat a lot. Very polished experience overall"
456,Brian,Aug 6 at 5:33 AM,5,No subscription,"This blends the best parts of Fit XR and supernatural, all without a subscription.

It has supernatural’s active coaching with Fit XR’s competitive points play, along innovations such as knee movements.

This is great for HIIT and it has better hit detection than Fit XR

Update: they keep updating it which is a good sign"
457,Armando Cruz,Jan 17 at 5:28 AM,5,Surprised,"Plays a little better than Boxing Vr. The variation of punch’s really makes this challenging. I hope they add direction changes like that super natural game that incorporates boxing. This is better than both of them. It’s now one of favorite games. 

Expert mode is a great challenge and the knees are a bit difficult. Still learning."
458,ButDidYouDie,Oct 9 at 7:34 PM,5,Love this game,If you are looking for a fun interactive workout game this is the one for you. In fact this game makes the purchase of the VR system worth it as this is one of the only games I play and the workouts and content seems to be continuously evolving. I have one complaint thought and that is that it seems the new content is not indefinitely replayable. I have caught some of the new classes which were really fun but I can’t seem to play them after a month or so when it gets refreshed. But even with the core classes it comes with it is still a very fun game and gives you a great workout. I recommend adding weighted wrist straps to give you a little extra challenge to help with strength and endurance training. Either way I highly recommend this game. I am interested in the talked about subscription plan that is in the works and how much it is going to be.
459,Bow,Jan 16 at 12:22 PM,5,Great App,Just bought this and have been using it the last 2 days. This app is amazing you have coaches to motivate you and I can see myself using this to lose weight and get fit.  It’s a proper work out and your need a recovery day in between sessions. I normally pay to go to a gym then end up stopping . This App will save you money and your more Likely to keep with the exercise as it’s from your own front room.
460,Elaine,Nov 1 at 11:37 PM,3,The music is the worst,"I wanted to like this. I really really did. I miss the old BoxVR, and this is so much like it. The graphics are gorgeous, the routines are do-able but still make me sweat. But I'm sorry, the music is awful. Really really awful. Unless you like the style, which I totally don't. I'm an 80s girl. Even some rock. But these tracks are boring, insipid, utterly demotivating. I can't. And then I noticed the same terrible songs are used in multiple routines! That's hardly a high quality experience. I would keep digging hoping there's some variety elsewhere but I don't want to get stuck past the refund period. I'm going back to PowerBeats where I can use my own great music."
461,ASKDroid,Jan 15 at 10:02 AM,5,Fun and intense workout made easy!,"Would want to keep the review very simple :

Can't stress the fact that unlike other apps this one's just one time fee and you get some amazing music and breathtaking views inside. Workout couldn't be more fun and I keep going on and on. Recommend this and don't put lot of thoughts, just go for it.

You can mark yourself against other users or just do your own thing. One of the things that attracted me was the one off payment, some apps are yearly subscription that you can’t get out of, I don’t like the idea of that at all especially after a four month injury that would have been wasted. Give it a go you won’t regret it."

I am 52 overweight,but with this app I believe I can get down to the right weight for my size and age ... finally a fun exercise experience and that's why you will achieve your goals fun and uplifting"
467,Michael,Oct 7 at 5:44 PM,5,"First impressions, great!","I was looking for a one time buy no subscription ""game"" to burn some calories. Currently sick at home with my wife, both with corona and we wanted to get some exercise. Bought it a couple days ago and both did multiple exercises.

This exceeds our expectations! Great and clear introduction. Multiple profiles to track your own progression. Environment looks nice but not distracting. Easily gets you going, timer and coaches are a good addition during an exercise. I like the competitive score board and exploding rings to push me a bit. Gets me sweating on the 2nd 5m easy exercise."
468,Rag,Oct 12 at 8:28 PM,4,Great fitness app… but!!,"I am really enjoying this app and would recommend it, however the calorie count is horribly out…in that ist displays way too little for the effort and time put in. I love the integration of a virtual watch to keep track of the calories, but I end up using my Apple Watch to track my actual Calorie burn. Disappointing but the only negative I can find."
469,ProudMom,Oct 6 at 7:08 PM,5,Absolutely amazing!!!,"If you want a great workout in half the time, then don’t hesitate to get LES MILLS!!! Hands down the best!! It will work your WHOLE body and sweat pouring!! I love that there is a leader board to challenge you to get to the top. The trainers push you to the limits but yet encourage you!! Definitely a must buy!!!"
470,Jacque,Jan 17 at 4:38 AM,5,OMG I Love This App,"I have been looking for a reason to start working out again after stopping and this app is just what Dr. Get Your Butt Up ordered… I don’t want to stop … I am getting good cardio, my heart rate is up and the most important part, I am having fun… Can’t wait until tomorrow !!"
471,Robert,Aug 21 at 10:07 PM,5,Better than Beatsaber and Supernatural,"I guess I got into VR for the same reasons that most other people have: Half-life: Alyx and to get a cheap, immersive workout. Naturally, I got Beatsaber and Supernatural for my cardio workouts, which work fairly well. 

The main advantage of this app is that it feels more visceral. You are getting constantly pushed by the coaches, there's no moment of just chilling and halfheartedly punching the targets. You notice, when you get weak, because the game encourages you to punch as hard as you can. The size of the rings is a good visual indicator for the force/speed you put into your punches. 

You also get the additional push of working out with and against others. You may only see their avatars briefly during the start of the workout, but the leader board is always looming just a bit to the right, reminding you to keep it up, if you want to keep that top spot.

Overall this game feels more physical, because the slower pace allows you to focus on form and clean executions rather than simply flailing your arms around like in Beatsaber or Supernatural."
472,Sir Not Appearing in this Game,Oct 5 at 3:06 AM,5,Absolutely worth it!,"I rarely write reviews (I know I should, but time restraints etc.) but for this game I had to take the time. All I've played is the first 5 min workout of it and it laid me on the floor. A lot of these games people find ways to ""fluff"" the scores and combos but this one is simple: the harder you swing, the bigger your score when you hit a target. I was swinging max on every single target on that first level and I can't wait to get back in. Will definitely be plugging this to my friends"
473,Jess,Oct 28 at 3:41 PM,3,Great work out for right handed people,"Overall, I use this app often to workout and the same issues occur with tracking on the left hand. Anytime I go for an upper punch or seem to punch a straight forward target with my left hand, it misses. The hooks are also a major pain point for my left hand.

For a boxing game, I am just surprised there isn’t better tracking for left handed people on this game. It gets frustrating when you’re trying to increase your score."
474,Ry Vigil,Oct 4 at 7:04 PM,5,Awesome value if you put in the work!,"I love martial arts and the idea of working out in VR.  I do have some kickboxing experience so I made the purchase and tried my first several workouts.  The boxing aspect is good and body positioning forms I know already, worked well.  Unfortunately the knee targets were a little tricky to pull off and not really placed how I would  have liked them (more centered such as when clinching an opponent).  Once VR catches up to fully body tracking without additional controllers, techniques such as kicks and knees will make these types of interactive workouts a game changer.  Until then, you can select what type of workout, the intensity and length to your liking.  It would nice if they added non-metric units as well when putting height and weight.  I would recommend turning on the move app too to double check along with the caloric counter in-game.  This app got me sore and sweating and am looking forward to using it more.  While not all moves you will be doing are considered 'boxing' techniques, the app is designed to get your body moving and on that notion, it succeeds well."
475,Di,Oct 4 at 10:16 PM,5,Exhilarating Workout,"The coaches are beside you all the way, coaching encouraging you every step.. perfect amount. 
I finish my workout, sweating and feeling like it’s the best all over body workout I’ve done in years (time poor person).  

There’s 
- kickboxing, squats, twists the lot..!   Many classes to choose from all levels and new classes regularly added.    
- a leader board so you can see how you’re going within the class (you only see the others players aviators at the start of the session.  
- a progress board on the main page to show how your calorie burn, streaks,  overall progression etc 

I feel recharged at the end of the fun workout. 

Good music and once off membership, no monthly fees. 

Absolutely brilliant..!"
476,Amber,Sep 27 at 9:35 PM,2,Frustrating,"What has me working out everyday for the first time in my life with Supernatural is that it is fun. I thought this would be fun too but I miss targets and I find it more frustrating than fun. If my knee comes up and I am performing the exercise, it should hit the target. Just my opinion that perfection isn’t what most people need. They just need to get moving. This one just isn’t for me and I’ll be looking to get a refund."
477,Shepherd,Oct 3 at 9:18 PM,5,The workout app I was waiting for,"This feels very close to a really workout class, the guided instructions and motivating comments from the trainers help to create this. The workouts will get your heart rate pumping. The only thing that would make it sensors for your legs for the leg work outs, it does a good job though without them."
478,Axalotal,Oct 4 at 4:35 AM,5,Best workout available on Meta Quest 2,"This is an edit to my original rating.  I upgraded it to five stars because the developers reached out and are helping me solve the issue.  

As I said, aside from not being able to do knee strikes, this is a fantastic get-fit app/game.  And I highly recommend it, especially with developers who listen to their customers this should only get better!
Should be 5 * but...

This is a fantastic workout, and I would recommend it to every.  So why the low rating?

It's because the game leaves me feeling defeated.  I get about one out of every 50 knees.  It doesn't matter how hard I pull them or time them with the trails, they just almost never register.  

This is so defeating when it takes you from top to bottom of the leaderboard.

It has become frustrating enough that I am considering switching to a paid subscription where at least I know if I miss something it's because I messed up.    Even when I miss one on this game/workout I at least know it's my fault.  

But to not get recognition for hitting targets constantly takes away all the fun.

Yes, I have done all the tourtorials, and even the practice knee exercise."
479,Solidus,Nov 30 at 2:38 AM,4,It's a fantastic way to sweat,It's an awesome workout.  Add a block maneuver in addition to the dodges and punches other than that. Great stuff.
480,Coach JD,Nov 7 at 5:42 AM,5,Trainers are great motivators!,"I have no problem making it through a workout m.  The trainers give encouragement and correction the entire workout.  Plus,  the music is great."
481,Pluto,Jul 20 at 1:46 AM,5,Life changing for fit and weight loose,"Premise: I am writing a very positive review, but I am not working for the developer of this application.. 😅

This application gives a fast, fun and efficient method and training path to gain back the fit and to loose weight.
I bought it one week ago and I have already lost 3 kilograms (something like 6 - 7 pounds ) since then, without modifying my diet or lifestyle.

I use it 30 minutes per day, nothing more, my body reacted fast to this kind of exercise and I regained 40-50% of my previous fitness state, that otherwise would have required 1 month to reach this with traditional training. 

Routines are fun, quite various, races between people making the exercise are motivating. 

Absolutely ti buy if you want to make serious training at home . 

Hopefully exercises wil be added regularly to avoid to get bored. 

Suggestions for developer:

1) introduce more new kind of exercises for legs and push them more in routines.
2) decrease the value of punches precision : it is not important for fitness if I hit in the center or not.. precision is against allowing more power that is instead useful for getting fit more efficiently 
3) use a smarter A.I. to suggest next exercises. Prepare a pack of 3-4 exercises that fit in the time user set up and modulate better with a crescendo of difficulty and a cool down.
4) add fancy scenarios and target styles to avoid boriness (e.g. Forest with wood targets, caste, shaolin temple, etc. )
Thank you very much for this application!"
482,Austin Sheets,Jan 9 at 2:55 AM,5,Definitely great cardio,I looked at many different apps for cardio. I almost got supernatural but this one A) doesn’t require a subscription and B) seemed more realistic in the mechanics. First time playing it I played for little over 20 mins and was sweating all over and heart rate stayed around 150 the whole time. My normal heart rate sits around 65-70. So definitely great for cardio. I was also breathing hard the whole time. With a person who has a lung condition. This will definitely benefit me to workout my lungs and heart. Recommend for anyone looking for a good easy to understand cardio experience.
483,Duke,Oct 29 at 9:33 PM,5,Extraordinary workout!,"I’ve tried the comparable fitness apps like supernatural and fit XR and I must say that this one gets my heart rate up and has me feeling a burn like none of the others! I’m
So glad I found this app and that it is a purchase rather than a subscription. I haven’t been as motivated with the other apps but this one has me jumping on several times a day during breaks to get a quick session in. It’s just that engaging and fun!

One issue that I’ve just started noticing though is that the screen orientation doesn’t face the way that I want it and I see no way to shift it. They main oculus screen is the correct orientation but once I open the app it faces a different direction. Similarly, the feet on the ground determine the position of the targets, and the feet are near the edge of my guardian so I need to drag them over into the center of my space, but don’t see how to do this. Hopefully I can get some help to figure this out because it just started happening and I cannot use the app without the positioning corrected,  otherwise I’ll be banging into things in my room."
484,Sam,Nov 1 at 8:31 AM,5,Wow,I have too many apps and never wrote a review… but this one is the first one I’ve been motivated to do so. Simply put… I want to work out now.
485,nebug,Nov 10 at 10:39 PM,3,OFFLINE,"Been enjoying this app since have bought. But of recent the app went offline with no way to go back online even after uninstalling and installing it back.

488,Lafinbear,Sep 29 at 5:44 PM,5,Superb way to exercise!,"If you're looking for way to stay energized about exercising regularly each week, this is app for you!  It is a great cardio work out, as well as a full body work out. I incorporate this one in my regular weekly workout regime.

It makes good use of the VR environment and experience, and with the coaches encouragement (albeit a bit repetitive) it makes exercising fun and effective.

There is a good selection of graduated exercise routines to choose from and the developers add new routines periodically.

I especially appreciate that this is a one-time purchase app, without a requirement for a monthly subscription. This was the main reason I decided to try this exercise app first, and I am very glad I did!

To the Dev Team: My one improvement request is for better alignment between the coaches' encouragement comments and your actual performance during the exercise. There does appear to be some alignment between performance and their comments at the end of the exercise, but not during the routine. Improving this would make it more realistic and immersive.

To everyone else: Put on your sweatband and your Quest 2, and get exercising!"
489,L,Sep 29 at 2:33 PM,5,10/10 review from personal trainer,"For as long as this app remains subscription free, it’ll be my go to fitness app. 

I’m a personal trainer and often look for new ways to work out, have been paying for FitXR subscription since February. And now I’ll be cancelling it. 

This has loads of variety, and whilst it a predominantly boxing, the moves really work the whole body. The inclusion of squats and variety of holds, as well as battle rope slams and different strikes get you SWEATING… grab a towel a couple of bottles of water, you’ll need them!"
490,lili,Jan 15 at 11:50 AM,5,I absolutely love it,I did teach lesmills classes for years . but I stop teaching since working full-time in healthcare.

491,Michaël M,Oct 28 at 3:56 PM,4,%???,"My pourcentage is always wrong.
I did a perfect round and my score was 72%
When the day before a miss 50% a got 66%

That's bullsh*t lol"
492,YogSothoth,Sep 6 at 9:42 PM,3,Fun but buggy,"Great game, like the concept, definitely does a great job at giving a good workout. But the hit collision doesn’t work well. Maybe it’s an issue with my controller (although no issues in other games) but when I hit with my left hand 20% of the time I get the no ring hit. It’s like I can’t hit the target properly. 

This is absurd and very frustrating. I’ve stop using the social feature, especially at height level, I often miss cause the system doesn’t properly detect my hit. Nothing more frustrating than giving all you energy and good motion in a punch to receive the base hit no ring effect.

I still do my regular sessions but I’ve stop caring about the scores. Even trying to beat my own combo, I will sometimes get complete miss on a hit, seriously… 

I’ve seen reply by the dev about not seeing this issue on their side. Sorry but it’s happening too often and to multiple users. It’s hard to believe that it’s working perfectly on your side. I’ve also tried with different room lighting and no change. Btw I have 12 years of MA experience, I think I know how to throw a punch."

495,Robert Quint,Aug 6 at 11:00 PM,5,Changed me for the best,"Honestly, this game has changed me life and the way I look at fitness. 2 years ago I stopped working out due to injuring my back and being diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Honestly never thought I would exercise again, I was put on medication and left to it. A few months ago I decided I wanted my life back so changed me diet, started doing mobility work and bought and oculus mostly for relaxation stuff, after looking at games to try on YouTube I saw one for this game and thought it looked challenging so decided to take a punt and buy it. It started off hard for me but I soon got into the swing of things starting on the lowest levels and working my way up once I started hitting the top of the leaderboard (even if I was way out of breath!) just today ive done my first workout on the top level (only a 5 min one) but ive come first on the leaderboard and honestly can’t believe it. It’s made fitness fun for me and motivates me to do it! The leaderboard is great because it pushes you a little bit. When I started about a month or two ago my resting heart rate was 76bpm on my watch, over the last week it’s been down to 66bpm and the last two days 64 so it’s obviously working. Honestly if you struggle with fitness and motivation give it a go. Thanks for helping me feel better than I’ve felt in a long time."
496,Andy,Sep 27 at 7:23 PM,5,Makes you feel like you’re in gym class,"Great game. Recorded guidance makes you feel like you’re in the gym class. Definitely great way to stress relief. What I’m going to do is getting some nice shoes for indoor use. It will make you much more comfortable and therefore more effective in training :) I agree with all positive comments, it’s a great way to get energetized."

498,Jomo,Sep 26 at 1:59 AM,5,Love it.Would really enjoy a multiplayer,"I've used this game as my workout since the beginning of the year and have been working out on average 3 days a week.
I love it I still can't do a lot more than the beginner workouts but that's fine I'm down 40 pounds and I hope to reach my goal of 50 by the end of the year.

I've gotten some of my family into it and we find ourselves wanting a way to do it together. A great example is beat saber they have an awesome multiplayer where you can go ahead to head. Would really enjoy taking my family members butts in this game I've gotten really good at precision and that new high score.

A multiplayer would be good for the community more people will buy more copies of the game to play against family and friends. Also I've read that the devs are working on the settings where you can toggle things on and off and that's the only other thing I would say needs to be added not that I would turn anything off I like it but options for anything are great. When it comes to options look to beat saber for inspiration. It might be nice to customize our sessions just a little bit ex I really enjoy a certain session but one day I might like it just a little bit faster.

The game is great definitely would recommend to anyone. Great work to everyone involved."
499,Russ,Jan 4 at 12:42 AM,5,Great app,I have done martial arts for thirty years but as I got older going to the dojo stoped being appealing.

502,Via,Jan 2 at 2:05 AM,5,I love this more than the IRL class,"￼Wow. i’ve done body combat in the gym  before, but I love this way more! I think it’s the competitive aspect to it, and I love to seeing myself beat people. 🤣I have several boxing VR games, but this one is the best.

This time, there are more updated workouts, so I can enjoy it without getting bored.
However, the 22 minute workout was harder than the hard advance class. 10 minutes of the advance class was danceable and I loved it. I would appreciate more content like this.
I don't need the vibration on the controller at the end when you achieve 50 combos, it's distracting.

513,Ian,Aug 18 at 9:09 PM,5,Great workout,"OK so I've tried numerous VR workout games and this one seems the best fit for me. There is no subscription but there are plenty of workouts and they do add to them. The workouts can be as light and short as you need. The higher intensity ones are a really good workout and make you sweat. I would advise the VR fan to stop the screen fogging up and also a neck fan.

The instructors are good, and even though a little cheesy at points it didn't take away from the experience. The music is good and goes well with the workout with the timing of the beats. Some workout games use music you know but it doesn't feel like it goes well with the workout.

Whenever anyone asks me for a good VR workout game I always say this game."

516,Josh,Aug 12 at 5:29 PM,5,Absolutely BUY THIS!,"I had Supernatural and due to technical issues that couldn’t be resolved in a timely manner, I canceled my subscription and bought/setup BodyCombat. Best part of all, this isn’t a monthly subscription that will cost more and more over time. This app is just as fun, has just as much engagement for caloric burn and calisthenic activity, and the coach audio can be turned off! That part is my wife’s absolute favorite thing about this app! I love the coach audio personally and really enjoy the ability to get a good workout from a VR game. Can’t recommend this strongly enough!"
517,Coffee,Oct 13 at 2:58 PM,3,Not quite friendly for 0 background,"The game requires a minimal understanding of how to boxing, otherwise you wouldn't know if you doing the movement correctly or not...

522,CatTestTrophy,Dec 25 at 2:07 PM,5,Great workout - great fun - great price,"I have spent the time since the pandemic mostly seated and this gets me going again. The app does a very good work at balancing what it demands from you to keep you challenged but not frustrated.
It really is a lot of fun. I used Wii fit to great success 10 years ago. I hoped, Ring-Fit would do the same for me but is was just too silly. This app, however, is fun while offering the seriousness that I want from an workout app.
I am also very thankful to the developer for not opting for a subscription model. You purchase once and get a fully working app. I am sure that I will also buy a second installment, when it comes around."
523,Nik,Sep 17 at 2:21 PM,5,Best workout in VR,"This workout program is just awesome and worth every cent!! The coaches are amazing and really guide you through every punch and movement. They explain exactly how to stand and where to focus on. For someone like me that randomly throws punches and gets hurt afterwards this is perfect since now I focus more on how to move rather than just focusing on hitting the targets. Music is great too!

Only small issue that bothers me is that the voiceover sometimes distort, but it doesn’t change my love for this application!

Highly recommend this:-)"

525,Diet Coke Gal,Jun 15 at 4:10 AM,5,Great fitness experience!,"Update 6/14
I LOVE THE NEW UPDATE!   I am still using solely your app for my exercise and am now down 35lbs!   I’m THRILLED with the results it has given me!   THANK YOU!!!!


I bought the Quest 2 specifically for fitness. I absolutely love this app.   I have been using six weeks and have lost about 16lbs.   I'll be honest and say when I started using this app,  I struggled to do 25 minutes of low impact.   Now,  I am doing 60 minutes of intermediate workouts five days a week.  I am THRILLED with my progress and how I feel.   I feel very empowered and so proud to have come so far so quickly.    I love the option to turn off the coaches, because after six weeks, I have my favorite workouts nearly memorized.    I needed the coaching at the beginning, and use them when I start a new workout, just to make sure I am keeping form and such.    It took me  two freaking weeks to figure out those knee jabs, but now they are my favorite!   I can do these workouts with two bad knees....hurts less than walking for exercise, so this is really really great news for me!   
I do have a couple suggestions....
~I love seeing my progress for each work out.  I try to beat my high score...every time.    I desperately wish you could include the number of targets I hit vs total targets.   This should be fairly easy to add, I would think.    I want to improve every time...so these things matter to me.   
~Add some 5-6 minute workouts in the intermediate & hard workouts.    Sometime I tell myself....I can do 5 more minutes....but have to do the low impact to   find one that is the 5 minute range.   
~I would love to be able to see my top 5 scores for each work out at the end so I can compare it to the current work out I did.   Again, just trying to improve each time is really important to me.  
Overall, I LOVE this app.    I love the coaches, the workouts and how I feel when I am done each time!    Really a great app.   I REALLY hope you don't ever go to subscription based."
526,Kiatti22,Oct 11 at 7:28 PM,5,Really good VR app,"I think this VR App is very comfortable to play. 
For me who is facing the problem of lack of space and time to exercise, this VR App has really helped me a lot."
527,Ozcar Storm,Dec 26 at 11:19 PM,4,More fun than irl Body Combat workout,"I’ve tried Les Mills body combat workouts in real life before and didn’t think “punching air” was a good workout for me. However, this VR experience version of the workout is way more fun (and a lot better) than the original! This is a really well-designed fitness app with a just price tag. I love that it’s not a subscription! 

There’s some room for improvements though; Bigger hands for some of us who do have large hands would be nice. 
Correct distance between the head(set) and hand(control)s is also an easy fix. (I kept knocking the headset when holding stance). 
I couldn’t get the knee-smash-move work at all - that was weird. 
The “hammer punch pads” were way too low (I wanted to adjust the height but I couldn’t find the settings for it). 
And maybe there could have been a little more haptic feedback when punching things. 

Otherwise, this is a fun experience and a good workout!"
528,Michał Kołodziej,Jul 24 at 8:26 PM,5,Brilliant with minor performance flaws,"I’ve been using Fit XR before and I must admit that Body Combat is another level. It’s a full body training with lots of moves, great tempo, music and coaches.
No woke agenda AFAIK. 
If you like boxing, squats, hammer strikes and other funny stuff do yourself a favor and wait no more. Just get it and flush Fit XR down the drain.

Pros:
- fluid and generally great graphics,
- 40 trainings with no subscription,
- 3 difficulty levels (advanced is a real beast),
- no woke agenda, just training,
- quality voiceovers,
- amazing results.

Cons:
- sometimes targets are missed although your hand goes throughout them (bug),
- frames per second go down (really!!) if you have a long ceiling above you making hitting targets impossible,
- I’d love to have more technique oriented tutorials for each of the strikes; if you’re like me not a pro, it’s not that obvious how to punch to get the highest power and good technique - please add more tuts, you’ve got so
amazing trainers!"
529,ScuffdSissy,Jan 8 at 7:33 PM,4,"I like it, but it didn't register knees",I like this. I feel like I got a decent workout. Wish there was a way to do more lower body training. Also the knees only register like 25% of the time. Gets kind of frustrating. Not sure if it's just my headset or what. I belirve I'm doing it right. It registers the knees sometimes. I don't know.
530,Laura,Sep 10 at 12:51 PM,5,Love this!,"I am using both this and Supernatural to keep me moving. I have been unmotivated and sedentary since COVID and this has been great to ""trick"" me into really working out. I love the different aspects of Supernatural that this app does not have, but I love the down and dirty ""get going"" aspect of this app. Definitely $30 well spent! I appreciate the affordability and owning this without subscription. 
Where are the cool downs and warm ups though?"
531,Jon Snow,Aug 1 at 6:04 PM,5,Awesome and Fun Workout!,"This is the best workout I've had in VR. It's a fun and polished experience with a varied set of moves to practice (jab, hook, uppercut, sky punch, ground and pound, rope slam, and even knees). All of the movements work well in VR and the workouts and combos flow very well. 

I wear some Sanabul 7oz MMA sparring gloves while playing to increase the difficulty of the workout. If they could make a good glove with a variable weight kit I think it would make a good accessory for this game.

I think these workouts work so well because they were developed as workouts first and foremost and then ported to VR instead of the other way around. Physical trainers are a lot better at designing a good workout than game developers.

No subscription model is a huge plus! I want to try Supernatural, but I refuse to pay almost 20 a month for it. Please never make this game subscription based. I don't mind paying more for BodyCombat 2, or DLC packs, to keep an incentive to create more workouts, but I like owning things I buy, not renting them.

Controller tracking works very well in this game, but hooks don't seem to register quite right, and the timing of knees forces me to focus more on my hands than my knee, which I think could be dialed in a bit.

I'm not a big fan of the way the longer workouts are combinations of the same shorter workouts. It makes it feel a bit repetitive, and like there's less content than it appears on first glance. There is still quite a bit of content though, and I still haven't managed to play through all the low and medium intensity workouts despite playing several times a week for about a month, and I haven't touched any of the high intensity stuff yet.

Recommendation: Try to add some footwork to the workouts. If you could add modes that require you to move like a boxer, reposition, bounce, pivot, step in and out of range, etc. It could add some additional depth, learning curve, and value for those who have the space to take advantage of it."
532,VR4EVER,Aug 15 at 12:01 PM,5,Quality workout supreme!,"Okay, let me start off by saying how much I enjoy the entire production value of this (completely underrepresented) App:

1. it has a very solid, high quality production value - you can see that in the trainers, the graphics and the environments, the UI (user interface), the voiceovers - everything is rocksolid!
2. LesMills is as much exhausting (in a postive sense) as it is great fun because of the trainers!
3. it is not your usual Murica-superstitious bruhaha - instead it has great humor coming more from the british side of things and I wholeheartedly embrace that (as a german!)!
4. the workouts are pumping your heartrate into the cardio level. Every. Single. Time.
5. no monthly subscription. Let that sink in.

Just pay those thirty bucks and enjoy a new beginning, a transformation of your mindset is not completely out of reach if you strive for a fitter, healthier life. I for one, will keep coming back to LesMills and its quality content. Thank you guys and girls who made this App possible, you have done an amazing job, really! Now keep your great work up, will ya?! ;-)"

534,MQ2Cat,Aug 23 at 10:10 AM,2,Fix the tracking please!,"First off - I quite love this app in general. The moves, the music, the comments - all good. BUT the controller tracking is abysmal! Both controllers and the headset are fully charged, I can SEE that I am hitting the target and it goes 'plunk' and I lose my combo score. And no, it's not that I am not hitting it properly. I have invited several ppl to watch me and tell me what I am doing wrong. I am aware that directions matter, especially with the knee pulls. But that's not it. It's the app-tracking. Also when you have your guard up properly - as you should - the controllers get confused and seemingly can't tell what you are doing with the other controller that is executing the action. Upper cuts get voided when I have my inactive hand up in guard position. I have to move the non-active hand out of the way for the tracking to work and validate the hit. Why? Please, please fix this. I am utterly motivated by my score going up and when these tracking mistakes happen repeatedly in one session it's so frustrating and enraging. I would give you 5 stars - but I need the tracking to work reliably. 
EDIT: I forgot to add that my tracking works flawlessly in FitXR - 100% hits, no glitches. Just in case someone would like to tell me that there is a problem with my hardware."
535,aminwrx,Aug 26 at 5:50 PM,5,Best exercise app with a few flaws,"Edit: Changed to 5 stars for feeling heard by dev.
Improvement feedback. 
-worst issue - If you walk out of bounds during a workout it completely enlarges the size of the targets making it nearly unplayable. You’re pretty much stuck in the workout till it ends. 
-the scoreboard is accurate but out of sync. You won’t truly know how you did against other players till the end of each workout.
-the game takes so long to get from booting to the main menu

Other thoughts/suggestions:
-why did you invest in voice commands? I can’t imagine ever using this feature when I have the controllers right in my hands.
-more workouts would be great. I was under the impression that more workouts would be added every month but I was wrong
-more robust workout breakdown/summary
-to add to the competitiveness add another bonus for hitting super hard. 3 levels of punching points: normal hit, strong hit, and very strong hit"
536,Ginny,Aug 30 at 2:18 AM,5,,I am 66 years old and due to issues with my legs I have had a number of surgeries in the last couple years. It even got to a point where I was just barely walking. Now I’m doing a Les mills! Enough said! I absolutely love it and would recommend it to everybody￼
537,CeCe,Jun 19 at 3:06 AM,5,Absolutely Amazing,"9 years ago I lost 100+ pounds doing Zumba on my Wii when no one thought I could lose weight playing a video game. 
Up until October of 2021, I’d kept that entire 100 pounds off. I got very sick and couldn’t workout at all, could barely walk some days, and had lost a huge amount of muscle as well as gained 30 pounds. I still can’t run, so I decided to download Supernatural on the oculus and try it out. It’s fun, but when Les Mills came out, I decided to give it a try since for the last 2 years my sister and I had been doing Les Mills workouts together and we loved it. 
Les Mills on Oculus has blown me away. Supernatural helped me with regaining coordination and was fun enough to keep me motivated, but LES MILLS BURNS ACTUAL CALORIES. My heart rate hits correctly and when I get done with my 2 —25 minute workouts, I’m drenched like when I was doing the online workouts. PLEASE KEEP UPDATING! I HAVE LOST 6 pounds since starting Les Mills on the oculus and over 5 inches overall. It keeps me motivated. I love how it forces you to punch harder and hit squats correctly and I’ve found if my form is correct my points go through the roof! I love how your score is up for you to see as you’re going through the workout. It helps  me keep my points up and seeing someone else’s score advance above mine just makes me want to work harder.

539,Yana,Oct 17 at 9:07 PM,5,Best I ever tried,"More than what I expected. Precise, intense, lots of fun, energising, extremely motivating!!!"
540,Ktea,Sep 15 at 4:43 AM,5,This is exactly what I was looking for!,"I really enjoy this and it is challenging if you are giving your all.  Great instruction and great beats.  Am I boxing, kick boxing, or slaying drums in between jabs?  Very well done and appropriately priced.   It’s fun and you sweat… total body."
541,Abso,Nov 13 at 2:58 PM,2,App is bugging,New Workouts don't load and new environments don't show. Please fix!!!!
542,Albin.Klein,Oct 1 at 2:52 PM,5,Great workout,"I'm very happy with the training from this app.
Love the different levels but I'm missing some warm up and cool down sessions.
Overall a very good app for her in shape"
543,IvorB1H,Jun 5 at 9:31 PM,5,Fantastic,"Really well crafted motivation picks you up when you start to slip great fun at the same time too.

Speaking as a father of 4 who’s massively out of shape I’ve always had the excuse that I can’t get out on my bike / go for a run etc since purchasing the Oculus Q2 my health has rapidly got much better. 

between this m, thrill of the fight and beat saber I’ve not done so much exercise since I was in my mid twenties ! 

Not just a glowing endorsement of this fantastic motivating app but the whole ‘meta verse’ no excuses now I can do it all at home at relatively low cost vs such hyped up things as the heart attack inducing peloton ! 

Buy it have fun get fit !

Update 5/6/22

After having this game now for a few months I can say that it’s really had a positive impact on my life alongside eating better and a few other activities I’ve lost 21.5kg to date and will hopefully start playing rugby again this autumn for the first time in 15 years.

Thanks to the guys&girls at Les mills and oculus for giving me a platform and the software to properly work out at home and spur me on to do more ‘RL’ activities than I have for a decade - hopefully many more people will benefit from this and other similar games who probably would have sat in front of the TV with a pot of Ben & Jerrys 💪👍"
544,Disgust,Jul 24 at 9:27 AM,5,Best VR Workout Game For Oculus,"I am not much of a workout person and I especially don't like watching videos to workout at home. I've seen some fairly positive reviews of this game. I really like active games like Beat Sabre. I honestly thought this would be some mild VR workout game that will get me into the groove of working out slowly. I never thought this would be game that will destroy my butt so much that the pain will reach my kidneys 😂 After playing a couple of the ""Low Intensity"" workouts in the game I'm sweating bullets and loving it at the same time. Working out with 6 other people and having a live scoreboard motivated me more than anything because I am super competitive. The only downside I found is that after starting to play this game, something in my controller started rattling. Hopefully the warranty will come handy. Maybe someday we can play this game with just bare hands!"
545,Zhixu,Nov 16 at 5:43 PM,3,Knee kick doesn’t work,Somehow my quest2 can’t detect the knee kick?
546,Laine,Sep 12 at 9:30 PM,2,"This app needs less talking, more music","I do Supernatural primarily but I wanted to try something new. 
The music sucks and there’s way too much talking. No cool backgrounds or scenery. Did I mention the music sucks? 
The movements are decent and on an advanced workout it’s downright hard. But boring. Intermediate workouts are easy if you’re coming from supernatural. Glad I only paid $10 for this because it’s pretty boring."
547,Christobell Ristobell,Jan 16 at 6:50 AM,5,Best work out game there is!,"This game not only is great for working out, it also is really fun and I actually look forward to working out every day."
548,Brookskirby,Sep 4 at 12:43 AM,5,Makes working out fun!,I love this game! I've only been playing it for a week oh but it definitely makes working out fun I enjoy it. I've never been one that would say yippee I'm going to go work out maybe I'm lazy don't know but this game makes me look forward to getting a workout. Bravo Les Mills you've turned a Couch Potato into someone who is now getting off the couch and working out. Thank you.
549,Ken Naylor,Dec 10 at 3:43 PM,5,Great Workout-Be Patient,"This is a great app and is superior (so far) to Supernatural. Way more movements and variety to the workouts. The only drawback (so far) is that there seems to be some accuracy issues and can be frustrating when it’s a leaderboard based app. But, for just pure work out, it’s awesome and I look forward to using it on cross training days while marathon training!"
550,Sabrina King,Oct 5 at 6:22 PM,5,Love the workout!,I’m getting great workout and thankful that finally someone can produce a decent workout without requiring a membership!!  Great job!
551,Marc,Sep 1 at 11:14 AM,5,Surprisingly: a real/fun workout,"This is the only workout program in VR I’v stuck with over months. Highly motivational, these trainers are fantastic. The app could include more environments and I would love to see more features on the multiplayer side (ie ability to compare scores between friends). I hope Body Mills will grow into something bigger from this foundation. I love it."
552,Dialecthicc,Aug 8 at 8:53 AM,5,Love this app (hope the devs see!),"I love working out in this app. At first I didn't believe that working out in VR could really me get sweating, thought it wouldn't compare to the cardio I do elsewhere, outside or the gym. Boy was I wrong. 10 minutes on this app and my workout mat is DRENCHED causing my feet to almost slip. Tip: Work out with your sneakers on even if you are in your living room!

Here are two things I wish this app offered:

An independent tutorial mode outside of all the workouts that teaches you how to do each move you come across in the app. This is not so much a problem with all the moves, but with the ones that involve kicking, I can't quite get the timing right. But I think I would do better if I could just independently work on it before going into a full workout. 

A multiplayer mode that allows you and a number of friends to go into a workout together and allows you to maybe voicechat in the breaks between the different parts of the workout. It would be so cool to see my friend's avatar struggle (as do I) at a corner of my VR screen. 

Overall, totally worth the price you pay at one purchase. I hope they add new features that allow more social interaction and it is not left to the mercy of some subscription feature."
553,Gzepp,Jan 24 at 12:00 AM,4,amazing !!!!!,"Looking to loose some weight??
This App is the WAY !!!!
Amazing!!!

Burn those calories Super Quick !!!
😓 🥵 
Just Add Apple Watch support and it would be 5 out 5 for me."
554,DhCampos,Aug 27 at 8:51 PM,4,The absolute best Oculus Workout App,"This near-perfect app has everything: challenging routines, beautiful graphics, fun music and great value considering that you DO NOT have to pay for a subscription every month. There is room for improvement such as adding to the pretty repetitive comments by the coaches and longer workout sessions as well, but this is truly an unbelievable ROI when it comes to working out in the convenience of your living room. The workouts are great cardio sessions that also promotes faster reflection reactions and even spatial awareness for athletes. Strongly recommend this app to former competitive athletes looking for a fun way of staying fit as well."
555,Me,Jan 1 at 6:43 PM,4,So far I’m loving it,The time passes quickly compared to a Normal workout not on vr. I work up a crazy sweat and I enjoy the trainers and the fact it keeps track of my workouts and calories burned . I do wish the settings were outdoors instead of a building but I definitely give this 4.5 stars!
556,Josh B.,Oct 7 at 2:22 AM,5,Favorite work out brought to VR,I’ve been doing Les Mills for years and it’s great to see it in VR. Good work out and great coaches!
557,djm217,Oct 15 at 9:17 PM,5,Great Workout,Love it! Has many levels of workouts covering many target areas!
558,Simon,Jan 21 at 2:40 AM,3,Warmup/Stretching missing,"I did a quick try, I like it so far, but warmup and stretching are missing, I feel it’s very important for such an app to add this.
I’ll adjust the stars when/if it will be added!"
559,Pixie,Jan 9 at 7:21 PM,5,"Dang, did that feel good!","Wasn’t expecting a full body workout yet here I am, sweaty and feeling amazing! Looking forward to another workout tomorrow!"
560,Siiyynn,Sep 29 at 2:10 AM,5,"Love! Buy it, you won't be dissapointed!","I love this workout game! Multiple intensity levels, lots of content great motivational coaching throughout the sets. Would highly recommend!"
561,John,Sep 17 at 5:27 PM,4,Great workout a little glitchy at times,I love this app. It's a great workout and my smart watch shows me so. At times some of the punches don't connect like I think they will. That's the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars.
562,I am Neo,Dec 4 at 11:50 PM,5,Motivational & good workout,Love this fitness app so far. It's boxing  workout with a good selection of workouts. Good cardio.  The instructors keep you motivated. You compete with other people online for high scores which is fun. I did 30 minutes and it flew by. Worked up a good sweat. 10/10. The nice  bonus is no subscription to pay. Pay one time for the app and your good to go. I got 25% off just do a search for it on Google for the coupon code. Highly recommended fitness app.
563,Calvados,Oct 4 at 1:45 AM,5,Best fitness app I’ve tried,I’ve used this for about a year.  I still enjoy it.   30 minutes is usually the most I do.  Excellent work outs.
564,Spider-Man,Jan 1 at 7:16 PM,5,Great workout app 💯,Just bought this today and what a good workout it is and plus no monthly payment’s definitely recommend this for everyone starting off a new year of a new me
565,Tina Marie Rice,Sep 7 at 3:39 AM,5,Great workout,"If you wanna get some good cardio in and some good strength training this is the workout for you it’s very engaging and pushes you to the limit and with the different levels you can really improve and push your work out to the next level!
￼"
566,ladybizarre,Sep 6 at 10:18 AM,5,Great,"That is what i was looking for. Just boxing with fitness. No sh*tty subscription, no annoying fitness bla cours no useless wannabe fitness extras. Boxing like box vr was. with great coaches without being to exicted and they also correcting you."
567,4DFamily,Jan 18 at 5:16 AM,5,Just get it,This is the best money spent no regrets just get it and stick with it
568,Aztecgizmo,Aug 25 at 6:03 AM,5,Great Fitness App,"I use this app and FitXR. I only do boxing in FitXR. So, this app uses more body parts to do the exercise session. The exercise space has excellent graphics. The routines are varied and give you a very good workout. For example, this app has you doing hammer punches, jabs up in the air, squatting doing jabs, double side punches, knee kicks and the kitchen sink. Well worth every penny! I wish there was more exercise apps like this one that does not require a monthly fee. Well done developers! My thanks."
569,Chris,Dec 28 at 11:34 PM,5,Only a few sessions and loving it.,"Fantastic game for getting your blood pumping.
Unlike other games I've played, the coaches seem to actually know whats going on and give you useful advice for the level."
570,Aragorn,Jan 29 at 4:08 PM,5,Top game,Awesome
571,ndfletch,Aug 26 at 8:07 PM,5,Kicking my rear,"I used to be a gym rat - 20 years ago. Most of my exercise since has been jumping to conclusions. This app has been kicking my rear, getting my cardio up in a fun way. 

New to VR, impressed with graphics and sound."
572,Broccoli,Sep 26 at 5:47 PM,5,What’s not to like?,I paid $30 and now I can just workout when I want. No subscription or pressure. This is the only app you’d need for exercise with VR.
573,BlackPantherGaming,Jul 6 at 1:28 AM,5,100% WORTH IT,"Les Mills Body Combat is truly one of the BEST fitness apps/games I have ever come across on! I used to play The Thrill of the Fight, and ended up getting bored of it after a few months. Its still a great game, but I wanted something more to do. I then came across Les Mills on the store, and after doing some research I decided to buy it. Now, if you are worried that there is a subscription, theres not. Why would there be? Its already $29.99, and thats a HUGE plus because you don’t have to pay excessive amounts of money a month or year, its a one time buy. And wow, this game is so well made! The trainers are excellent, and keep you motivated the whole entire session. There are many workouts, with different intensity and duration. There are even tutorials on how to properly jab, dodge, etc. This game is actually quite similar to beatsaber, but with punching, differentiating moves and a personal trainer explaining and motivating you in the background. The song choices are also not that bad. I have been using Les Mills for a few days, and WOW! I have been going for medium or high intensity workouts and after every session I am left sweating and PUMPED UP! Ready for more and more after every session! It depends on how hard you punch, the harder you punch, the higher score you get! It works the muscles well, and even tells you how you did after the session! It tells you the amount of calories you burned, they percentage on how well you kept up, and overall your high score on the leaderboard. On the main menu, it keeps track  of the total calories burned, and allows you to set custom goals and days you want to workout. This game is truly worth every cent, and I totally recommend to everyone! 5/5"
574,Bobkat,Dec 23 at 3:46 PM,5,Really like the intro and the training,"Just got the program and a member of a subscription-based program for a long time.  This app is absolutely awesome, I just hope we can purchase future updates with new music and surrounding."
575,Jason,Aug 24 at 7:16 AM,5,Still my go to workout app,"I'm not a gamer but I bought an oculus purely for fitness and, after trying everything other than Supernatural (unavailable in Australia), this is the one that feels the most ""real"" when it comes to boxing workouts. 6 months later and I'm still using it 4 or 5 times a week and 2x20 minute sessions at level 3 leaves me soaked in sweat and I'm yet to get bored with any of the workouts yet."
576,Black Cobra,Dec 12 at 1:12 AM,5,Fantastic Experience,"I have played several workout games in VR, and this is by far the best. It may not have Sabres of light to swing around, but it truly does have great music, great atmosphere, great coaches and an overall amazing workout. ￼simply a MUST PLAY!"
577,Hayati IO,Jan 26 at 12:51 PM,5,good workout,best for workout
578,Rockville,Sep 21 at 1:50 AM,5,Hands down the best VR fitness game,Les Mills provides a superb quality game with regular updates and no subscription fees. Easiest and best interface of any of the fitness apps. Strongly recommend
579,FoxxC102822,Nov 30 at 10:41 AM,5,Battle Myself Image,Loving this game it’s fantastic!! I’ve been looking for the motivation to get in shape and this is it. Fantastic workout it gets you moving and will really get your blood flowing I really feel like I’m in the game. This VR Oculus Quest 2 is one of the best investments I’ve ever made.❤️❤️❤️❤️
580,Gee,Sep 27 at 6:18 AM,4,Please all us to workout in nature,"Great app, great workouts, my only gripe is why am I always facing an interior room? There are scenery built in the game, why can't developers REMOVE the room and just make us workout in the exterior scenes like Supernatural lol"
581,Thomas,Jan 22 at 7:01 AM,5,Awesome,Great workouts.  No subscription.
582,Messenger,Aug 27 at 3:26 PM,5,"Perfect, but multiplayer missing","I love the game, it's challenging and also fun to play. Only thing missing for me is a multiplayer mode where you can start sessions together with friends.."
583,Insanity is Sanity,Aug 23 at 12:50 AM,5,The best app ever,"I own like 30 apps and games on my Quest 2 and this is the first review I'm writing. This app is outstanding, I've purchased myself some resistance bands and a pull up bar, those combined with this app now mean i no longer pay £38 a month for a gym membership. 

I would highly recommend this app if you're looking to get in shape and exercise."
584,Rob,Aug 22 at 6:06 AM,5,Made a believer out of me!,"So I never leave reviews, but this one is worth it. I got this a couple days ago, so I'll be back in a couple months for an update story, however, I've messed with it all weekend, and done quite a few of the work outs. If you do it properly, follow instructions, and actually hit when doing this exercises, the completely work. My body is sore from messing with it for probably two hrs over the weekend in spurts, and it feels like I've been to the gym. Oculus move will keep up with your calories, but the game also has that feature built in. It's well worth the money, and rotates some of the exercises in and out to keep things fresh!"
585,Zeus,Jul 29 at 7:25 PM,5,"Great Workout, If You Aren’t Discuraged","Honestly, the best workout I’ve had in VR.  This encourages you to use your whole body and it gets the heart pumping.  

The upsides are obvious, the work outs are balanced, the trainers encouraging and peppy, well chosen music, pretty good execution.


The downside is the leaderboard and scoring.  There are exercises that for whatever reason I can smash the target but can’t seem to hit the center for the score.  You watch as you put out effort smashing targets and your name just keeps falling.  Can be frustrating and distract from the real purpose of getting exercise in.  Fortunately, you can also turn off Social mode and just focus on you and your performance.  Don’t let the scoring get you down."
586,Mark K,Jan 4 at 9:39 PM,5,Lea mills winner,"Absolutely brilliant- whole family loves it and keeps you fit ! 
Excellent 👌 

Keep the work outs coming 👍👍"
587,Clare,Aug 21 at 2:40 PM,5,Love it,"I don’t understand all the one stars! I find the trainers great and keep me motivated, please do not get rid of this, just maybe have an option to turn off. I like the leader boards gives me motivation to work harder. I find the workouts very good and gets my heart rate beating out of my chest! I feel great afterwards and my arms and leg ache and I feel I have really worked. I love this app and don’t get the negative comments. Ok I guess u can’t please everyone but for me, it is the best workout app. The only negative is when they say I am almost 90%, 90% what? And where can we see what the actual percentage is. Not as much info about the workout afterwards. Please more exercise apps they are fantastic.



The new voice update doesn’t work, keeps saying doesn’t understand no matter how I word it. Redundant feature."
588,Kev,Oct 12 at 8:00 PM,5,Sublime,"You fat?
Get this game... be less fat"
589,SpiritSong1031,Aug 21 at 12:23 AM,5,Love this workout game!!,"Love this workout game!!  Hitting the targets are much more satisfying than another workout game I tried where when you hit the targets, it sounds like a popping bubble which for some reason annoyed me to no end.  It’s also nice how this game has knee kick targets to hit.  The change in scenery change for each challenge is nice.I also like the no subscription model.  I have started using this game for workouts as much as Beat Saber and  some of the others, thank you to the developers in helping me get back into doing workouts!"
590,ShogunShonuff,Dec 26 at 1:37 AM,5,Well Crafted.,"Being a brown belt in Wado Ryu and green in Kempo, it took a while to get past the terminology but at 65, this is better than a medication  that the VA has"
591,Marvin,Aug 29 at 6:16 AM,5,Very good sweat every time,I just got my oculus couple days ago bought thrill of the fight then this one .. i play both i will do this more often for proper posture training and fun play and thrill of the fight if i just feel beating up someone🤣 works really great for work out.
592,Theo G. Bro,Aug 19 at 10:09 PM,5,This is what the quest was made for,"... well at least for me. I bought it as a fitness device. For over 20 years I always tried to link my fitness sessions to consoles, starting with the WII. But I soon lost interest because it never felt ""real"". This one fits like a glove. I am actually enjoying the session with the wardens (eee. coaches). Well done. And without subscribtion but new content every now and then, this never gets boring"
593,PJ Drifting,Dec 29 at 9:13 AM,5,Surprisingly good!,Already experienced great VR exercise with Thrill of the Fight. This one steps it up a notch (or 3). Def adding to my fitness regime
594,Empress Junebug,Aug 7 at 2:21 AM,5,So much fun,"I use this app 3 times a week and have done all of the advanced workouts multiple times. I thought I’d get board, but they are always challenging and there’s so many of them you can’t really get though them all close together so by the time you circle back to the first one you’ve done - it’s like a whole new game. 
I wasn’t expecting the upgrades and new rounds that have been added since I purchased it. Really great.
Thanks guys good work, keep it up !"
595,Miskue,Aug 8 at 10:44 AM,5,My absolute go to app,"Following weight gain during lockdown, hitting the big 5 0, a recent copd diagnosis and losing my self confidence I felt now more than ever was the right time to turn things around. I bought my quest 2 a fortnight ago with the intention of getting fit. Les Mills Bodycombat is my absolute go to app every night which surprises me as I hate gyms! It’s great fun and you can choose the intensity and length of your workout. You are also guided by Dan and Rachael every step of the way so you know you’re getting the best results from your workout. My first few 4+ min beginner sessions had me dripping with sweat but not in a bad way, I’m now comfortably completing 14+ min beginner sessions. I tried a 14 min intermediate session for the first time today but had to pull out after 8 mins so that’s my new goal. Best thing is my o2 levels have started to raise and level out, oh and I’ve discovered I’ve got a mean left and right hook! Haha If you buy this app I’m sure you won’t be disappointed 😊"
596,Nekro CorpsE,Jul 26 at 1:17 AM,5,Amazing... also no subscriptions,"This app is amazing and had helped me get toned along with pistol whip n thrill of the fight. The workouts are fun, challenging and the tracking is spot on accurate. They have kept adding workouts here and there and i hope for the new ones they add different songs and different locales, other than that the app works as suggested and i even signed up for their regular works outs now that i have gotten better stamina and resistance and can actually complete them. Please dont mess the app up with subscriptions, thats the best thing this app has going for it, its changing lives and not gouging you with greedy subscription services like every other app does. If your going to get in shape FORGET THE REST AND GET THE BEST!!!! Les mills"
597,Divisionbell,Jul 22 at 4:22 PM,3,Great app BUT…,"This is a great exercise app, and it does a great job of getting your heart rate up. It was actually far more engaging than I was expecting. However, it desperately needs to utilize hand tracking. Holding the controllers for the routines does not feel natural at all, and it makes a lot of it feel really awkward. Please implement hand tracking and you will have an amazing app on your hands."
598,XooKimberlyoox,Aug 17 at 9:02 AM,5,Wow!!,Debated on getting this app. Since they talked about a subscription.  But once I read up on it and they said it's a choice. While it was on sale and only seconds to get it (29sec.) I bought it.  I'm am not sorry I did.  Wow just wow. The motivation of the teachers had me ducking lower and hitting harder!! I can't afford a subscription but what they give you now is plenty!! I had to take a break but couldn't wait to get back to it!! Nice job!! Thank you! Not only is it a work out that makes you feel good and wanting to do it again but it's fun!!!
599,Scott Beeson,Aug 23 at 4:53 PM,5,"Just started, but really impressed","Lots of these apps say they make exercise easy and fun, but this one delivers. Simple, straightforward, no distracting fluff, but still very immersive and motivating. I consider myself very critical of software and UX and so far I have zero complaints about this app!"
600,Simon,Oct 3 at 2:10 PM,5,Love it.,"Absolutely love it,  great work out app, a must buy 👍🏽"
601,Atlas,Aug 16 at 8:00 AM,5,#1 for losing weight!,"I incorporate this app with a CICO diet. I work remote and never leave the house. So when I first got VR and used the free Beat Saber game that came with it I instantly felt great getting some movement in. After sometime I wanted something more as beat saber can get very repetitive.

So i found supernatural and the scenery looks amazing but then I saw it needed a subscription... that was almost the same cost as a regular gym membership. The reviews were mixed and leaning towards the negative side.

So i youtubed and I was introduced to Les Mills! I LOVE IT. I just started tonight, did two works out and was DRENCHED in sweat. One of my problem areas are my arms so I feel like this will really help me with that.

Don't hesitate. This app is amazing. I love the coaches voices in the background giving you tips and encouraging you."

606,Bertavo,Aug 25 at 2:18 AM,5,Perfect fitness game,I bought it to try it out while thinking that it would be a bad game but that was not the case. It was really challenging and I kept track of my hart rate and that was 165 bpm on average so it was really challenging and I still enjoy playing it.
607,slewis,Jun 11 at 8:58 PM,5,Feeling Stronger Now!,"I admit it: I was a dedicated regular at the gym pretty much my entire adult life but I have not returned since the pandemic.  At this point, it is more about how much a chunk it took out of my day then fear of infection.  During this time, I have done more walking when outside conditions are good and I have looked to VR to fill a gap in my conditioning.  

My wife got a subscription to Supernatural and when we shared a headset, I used it semi-regularly and enjoyed it.  The variety in music and scenery is great, I could get a good workout and especially loved the new boxing features.  Of course, it is fantastic that there are new workouts to select from every day.  However, like every VR fitness app, there are a limited number of moves that can be tracked and new music and coaching can’t change that.  When we got a second headset (no more sharing a headset), I wanted a fitness app that gave me a great workout that would keep me coming back without requiring a subscription.

I have owned Les Mills Body Combat (LMBC) for almost two months and it fits my needs perfectly.  I really enjoy all the boxing moves and between those and the squats I can definitely get winded.  The knee slam move, which took me a few sessions to get good at matching the app’s expected movements and timing, is really an innovative idea that I have not seen elsewhere in VR.  There is a satisfactory selection of workout intensities and durations and I have worked myself up from light, to medium and now to high intensity feeling like I am getting back into shape.  Even though a lot of elements of the workouts keep repeating, the coaching is very well done and I have not grown tired of it.  The music used in LMBC is appropriate for setting the pace and as background.

Most importantly, LMBC has kept me coming back to it!  I am enjoying my workouts and I feel good.  I keep up with their Discord channel and a representative is fairly responsive there.  They have already made several small improvement and fixes to the app based on customer feedback and suggested that more free content will be added (more workouts will be nice over the long run; also more stats and real multi-player capabilities).  There is also a suggestion that an optional subscription may be added, but the base content will stay available as a one time purchase.  I do not think I would want a subscription, but I would be happy to pay periodically for extra content.

As is, Les Mills perfectly fits my needs and I am thrilled with my purchase."
608,André,Jan 2 at 10:27 AM,5,Very good.,"Good value for the money, and best of all: no stinking subscription or in-app-purchases."

1- friends leaderboard with conparison of points and statistics, and even have the friends who use the app on the little leaderboard while doing the workout, this will push to the limits the attitude of the players involved, much more than it already is.
So please consider to add this 

2- please i really need a swich off music setting, that tekno really sucks.
Dreaming about custom music, the soundtracks really sucks i hate that kind of music, i really need to listen to metal tracks that get me in the perfect mental hype to give all. 
If it's not possible, please consider to implement a youtube player while doing the sessions, like other apps do (real vr fishing for example) so everyone can listen what they want while workout and get the hype boost from their favorit music.
Please please plese, this is a game changer.

Thank you very much for your work, this workout app is the greatest ever.

Alex."
612,Josip,Sep 15 at 11:20 PM,5,Coming from fitXR,Nothing to say but get this app. It's amazing and on another level.. coaches are top notch. Looking forward to future updates. 🤜🤛
613,Pav,Aug 14 at 12:38 AM,5,Great and convenient,"Find yourself a 3 x 3 space, and get ready to sweat bullets. The combination of boxing strikes, along with squatting, dodging and knee strikes, will keep you from getting bored. The leader board will keep you motivated if you like winning (I don’t know about you…I love winning). It’s one price, no subscription, and a good variety of workouts. I could see the voice overs getting old after a while, but no more repetitive than the old P90X workouts.  Totally worth the money. Get it."
614,Rob,Dec 30 at 4:04 AM,5,Surprisingly unexpected,"Wow! 10 minutes and you’re huffing and puffing, heart rate up, blood pumping. I like it, thanks."
615,MJVR,Sep 2 at 8:24 PM,4,Better than first impression,"I earlier rated this app 1 star. All the feedback given is still valid (no warm up and cool down, scoring is not accurate, there are no multi day programs).  After using this app for more than 20-25 times I appreciate it much more and see its value. I in fact convinced one of my buddy to download as well. Way to go folks…"
616,Astro Girl,Aug 30 at 3:06 AM,5,THE best workout VR app out there.,"All I am going to say is this is the best fitness app on VR and other apps need to get with the program. If you want to know what’s it, this is it. No competition out there compares. Thank you Les Mills!!!!"
617,thebastians,Aug 11 at 10:44 PM,5,Great workout app,"I’ve been using this app for about 2 weeks now and love it! It makes exercising fun and something I actually look forward to doing. Got it because I saw that Supernatural required a subscription but didn’t want to have to pay monthly, so I read some reviews that mentioned this app. Definitely worth the 1 time payment. Can’t speak to any weight loss yet, but I can say that I’ve been sore the next day and feel different muscles working than with my usual exercises. Highly recommend!"
618,Stacy Cakes,Dec 4 at 7:55 PM,5,Loving this,"So glad I read another’s review and decided to buy this instead of super natural!  Having a blast with this app!  If your thinking about getting this, do it!  You will love it and will look forward to working out!"
619,Mihai Caslariu,Oct 1 at 8:56 PM,5,Simply the best,Simply the best Oculus fitness app!
620,Haydee Vasquez,Aug 9 at 6:11 AM,5,I love love it!!!,"If you are looking to have fun, release stress and burn calories this is it. Im a busy mom and actually go to real BodyCombat LessMills classes at my gym but sadly cant always make it. I decided to download this and give it a try and i can assure you that i it feels exactly the same. 
Give it a try for a few days and decide for yourself."
621,Taquill,Jan 4 at 8:14 PM,4,Great but sadly no Multiplayer,Its really fun to Workout with this game but it sadly has no multiplayer. it would be great to measure with friends und get even more power out of myself :)
622,Andy,Jan 23 at 8:40 PM,1,WTF?!!,"Bought it & days ago and still haven’t even got it downloaded ?

Just send a refund please"
623,Webdizz,Sep 25 at 7:26 PM,5,I’”m sweating!!,Really motivating fitness-game! Perfect buy for 29.99€…
624,Ilya,Jan 1 at 12:51 PM,5,Great involvement!,"It’s fun and useful, what else do we need from entertainment?"
625,ranaravs,Sep 12 at 2:50 AM,5,"Fun! No subscription, no motion sickness","Fun game to get your blood moving. Sweat a ton!

*Can't seem to get the knees working, I uninstalled, reinstalled and the knees still don't work."
626,Holly Simon,Nov 20 at 5:44 AM,5,Holy kick my azz!!,I bought this in addition to Super Natural work out.    Holy crap I LOVE this!  Last night was the first time I did the tutorial and a workout.   Today I did another workout after my SN workout.   My arms were shaking after body combat!     I love it !  I am hooked!!!
627,Tomyryota,Oct 3 at 3:07 PM,5,Good workout,I love this!
628,Gareth,Aug 6 at 7:00 PM,5,Brilliant,"I think this app is brilliant and nearly every morning I do a good hour on this App. If I had to make one comment I would like more heavy duty work outs like full force, where I don't need to do two of them in a morning to get my calorie burn. 
In my opinion though definitely the best workout  APP."
629,Freddy P,Dec 27 at 7:01 PM,5,High intensity,If your a fan of high intensity interval training body combat is your ticket.
630,Mama,Aug 18 at 12:46 AM,5,They never let me down.,I started with these two when they did beachbody. I loved them then and lost weight. Most of the things I have tried has worked the top portion but the lower body was a hit or miss. This is an all body workout. Well worth the money spent.
631,Jodie May,Aug 4 at 4:10 PM,5,Almost as good as the classes,"I used to be a regular at physical BC classes, but then Covid put an end to that and my local classes disappeared or became prohibitively expensive. So when i saw this on VR i was interested. I'd been doing Thrill of the Fight but found it very samey and without motivation I lost interest. 
But Les Mills Bodycombat is almost like being in a class, and you're motivated by several things like leaderboard, targets to aim at and destruction detail depending on hit power.  Many different workouts and durations and they are ordered by intensity. Great soundtracks which anyone familiar with the classes would be happy with. Its an enjoyable workout I can pack in my bag and take wherever i go.    It's 5 stars from me.

For the future I'd perhaps like to see some popular classic bodycombat workouts available as I remember some stonkers from the past. And perhaps in future live multi-user classes?"
632,Meta Explorer,Sep 26 at 10:10 PM,5,"Complete work-out, new training, perfect",The best work-out app in my opinion
633,Endasil,Jul 29 at 1:29 AM,3,Repetitive,"It was fun the first few times but then it got repetitive. Would like to see a social mode where i can play realtime with a friend. A voice that's actually in sync with what's happening, don't tell me how great my combo county is when it's hitting zero. Some clarity on what makes a hit explode, the feeling of random failures is just frustrating, if it fails i want to understand why."
634,Mr E,Sep 29 at 5:01 PM,5,"Highly recommend, incredible value",Great workout 🙂
635,Mr Chazbo II,Aug 24 at 10:57 PM,5,Great workout that’s fun!,"I’ve used a few workout vr games and they always require a monthly fee. I like that this game does not and it’s tops. It’s fun, challenging, engaging and one heck of a workout!! I love it!"
636,Super Annie O,Dec 31 at 6:28 PM,5,Awesome Workout!,Makes me sweat just like a studio workout!
637,Jivas,Sep 24 at 2:13 AM,5,I fixed the leaderboard annoying issue,"Awesome workout game, the best available."
638,BeeWitch,Aug 30 at 12:57 PM,1,Disappointing,"I purchased the app recently, but I have been unable to play.  Every time I try to open it, I am told I need to update it, which I try to do with zero success. 
 Very frustrating."
639,Teacher2022,Jul 18 at 2:45 AM,5,Best VR Workout App,"I tried several VR exercise apps to increase my activity, and Les Mills Body Combat is clearly the best.  I use a chest strap heart monitor when I train. This morning I did a 25 minute advanced Les Mills workout. My heart rate was above 70% of my maximum heart rate for over 23 minutes. My heart rate peaked at over 95% of my maximum heart rate. I burned over 300 calories. If you're looking for a real workout this is the one. If you want to increase your intensity add some wrist and ankle weights."
640,ChrysisLT,Aug 22 at 3:07 PM,4,Great exercise app,"I love this app, and I wish that I had found it during the Covid quarantine. Great exercise, great fun as well. 

The thing I lack is a way to string together the individual 4-5 mins segments to one larger. Right now there are only two 20 mins+ exercises on intermediate and now I know them by heart. It gets somewhat repetetive. By making sort of a ""playlist"" of smaller I would like to make my own. Right now I have to pick several 4-5 mins ones and then suffer the loading time between them."
641,Ralf Eggersgaard,Dec 30 at 6:02 PM,5,Realy great fitness app,Gratis exerzise with high pulse. Love it
642,Shanie,Aug 25 at 9:13 PM,5,Amazing,I like many purchased Supernatural and loved it until I tried this. This workout definitely pushes you to work harder. Being able to see others scores as you workout is motivating.
643,nk,Sep 27 at 3:20 PM,5,Good workout,Worth the money
644,Kevin,Nov 18 at 5:44 PM,5,Feeling good,"I absolutely love this app, not only do I work up a pretty good sweat but I feel great post workout. I've been using several other fitness apps and I enjoy them all for different reasons, but this one is by far my favorite it's the total package."

646,SoZornig,Aug 5 at 6:55 PM,2,Game of chance,"In the current state it's not a matter of speed, precision or timing to hit targets and get a streak. 
Feels more like gambling than working out.

Apps from competitors are way better when it comes to hit detection. There's lots of work to do before i can recommend this app."
647,Vamsi Krishna Vemuri,Jul 31 at 9:40 AM,5,5 Stars are not enough!,"This is by far the most comprehensive VR workout game I've played and am simply glued to it! I've tried all sorts of apps for the past 4 years, but this one particularly stands out to me. 

One of the most unique aspects is the commentary by Rach and Dan and it gets you really motivated to push harder and faster! Their tips are really helpful to pay attention to your posture and actions to activate the body in the best possible way. 

Not a fan of subscriptions, but I genuinely look forward to more exciting content from the creators through DLCs, modifiers and any other upgrades. And probably even harder levels. 😉

Love the game! 💙"
648,MedicBoyd,Jul 31 at 10:40 PM,5,An absolute must for fitness gamers!!,"I bought the Oculus just to play Supernatural, and I still play it almost daily. But I was looking for some fun boxing games, and not finding anything good. I saw Les mills and decided to try it. I was 100% hooked the first day! Now my routine is to play a game of SN, and then a LM game. It’s a great form of cardio, and it builds muscle. Best boxing game I’ve seen for VR."
649,Zacoota,Sep 13 at 4:14 AM,5,"Absolutely love it,","Awesome workout, for all skill levels, best part is i own it no monthly payments"
650,Doomnoodle,Sep 26 at 9:49 PM,4,Great,"Great exercise, love the inclusion of more legs!  Still adjusting to the difference in timing but all in all worth it!"
651,Victor,"Mar 11, 2022 at 6:38 PM",5,Loved it! Please don’t do memberships,"100% loved it. Now, folks like me living in distant countries, I hope Les Mills doesn’t do memberships in the near/long term. I’ll happily buy “new workout packs”, like on Beat Saber, something like “10 new updated workouts” for an X amount of dollars, but there’s no way that folks around the world can do exclusive memberships with these kind of apps. And I hope you go for the masses, we need to be healthier! Like when I bought my Quest 2 I was ready to pay for a Supernatural membership, but it became virtually impossible to do this outside the States (copyright for music, taxes for subscriptions, or whatever reasons made it super complicated). Now supernatural is imposible to get in many countries.

Please don’t take the membership route LesMills and people will probably recommend your app as the #1 VR fitness app in the WORLD. Literally.

Thank you so much for making sweat like a pig."
652,Dani,Jun 8 at 3:57 AM,5,Cancelling Supernatural!,"This is a great workout!  I'm cancelling my Supernatural membership and praying this game doesn't switch to memberships!  I understand people need to make money, but they could do upgrades for new workouts or special content, and keep it cheap ($3-5) like Walkabout Mini Golf.  I also like that there are other people working out with you, but sometimes that leaderboard can be distracting."
653,D Will,Jul 31 at 12:32 AM,5,I wasn’t ready,I workout in gyms. But when it comes to cardio I just don’t do it.  But I saw Les Mills and had to try it.  So went and tried a 20 min workout just to keep things light. First I should’ve did 9 min.  Second maybe I should’ve gotten out of my work clothes.  Let me tell you I wasn’t ready.  I kept having to realign myself.  The fan wasn’t high enough. I didn’t have water. Let me just say it again I wasn’t ready.  The sweat was real at one point I felt myself breathing hard 🤣.  Can’t wait to go through the whole program. I’m excited. If you aren’t excited yet to get. I suggest you do and pls add Me. Always looking for competition
654,Sam,Aug 12 at 1:31 AM,1,Not a fan,When the app first starts you can’t get around the long intro. That just set the scene to the entire app. The only good think for this app is that it’s not subscription based.
655,KonaLuna,Jul 29 at 3:55 PM,5,The absolute best VR workout,"I have used video games as my workout routine for years since the Wii balance board so I thought I would give Oculus a shot. I was underwhelmed with the available fitness apps, especially since they all require a subscription. Then I found Les Mills.  Wow! It is awesome!  Other apps did not make me sweat this much! Beat Saber is a good one but I definitely don't sweat as much or feel like I actually had a workout.  Thank you Les Mills!! I've lost 20 lbs so far.

The only suggestion I have is it would be nice to make our own workouts by combining songs. Also a no squat setting. I have bad knees and can't do the full squats. I've got a work around where I do back bends/crunches and that is fine but it would be nice to have more settings for us oldies. Otherwise BRAVO!!"
656,sabrina,Aug 2 at 4:03 PM,5,Amazing workouts,"Purchased this game a few days ago and I love it. It really makes you sweat and burn calories. There’s a good variety of workouts (different intensities, lengths and body type workouts). Only thing thing that would improve this app is having water breaks within the workouts!"
657,lostatbirth,Jul 31 at 5:05 PM,5,Youll need a visor frame sweat cover,"With a doubt the only bonafide VR exercise workout app that keeps you in heartzone 1. When the last punch is thrown and the last icon you hit explodes into smitherines you feel that you earned that! Proper routines and classes, proper coaching and encouragement that leaves cheese at the door and tweaks your form & breathing. Rachel & Dan are ledge. Good stratification of intensity. The thought put into the workouts and their variety is backed up by the music choices that blend really well and the fantasy environments your open gym is in.....I also love the fact that you get a complete polished product - complete. no subscription. no dlc. Its authentic, challenging, enjoyable, satisfying and motivating in a very polished presentation. Unsurpassed value."
658,TRINA,Aug 23 at 9:39 PM,5,So satisfied,I've been a les mills fan for years! I love the short bursts of workout and the encouragement from Rach and Dan is amazing! If i could give more stars i would
659,Zentric Egg,Jul 26 at 1:20 AM,5,The best.. very high quality system,"I have tried quite a few other fitness apps but I got tired of paying monthly. Life is increasingly subscription filled so I try to minimise monthly expenditures.  Les Mills is a very high quality, well thought-out fitness system. It's nice to see real trainers rather than the cartoon puppets some other fitness apps offer.

The exercise is fun and challenging. The leaderboard system is excellent. 

Beautiful environments.

Worth the asking price."
660,Josh,Sep 7 at 2:34 PM,5,Great app!,Very very effective for fitness goals! Probably one of the top 3 in my opinion!
661,IAMAMARRIEDWOMANRESPECTME,Aug 5 at 12:57 AM,5,I love it,I've been doing Les mills for about 4 months now I think.. I love it more than my fitxr which I've been doing for about a year.. keep up the good work Lesmills.. I love the new updates you have.. can't wait to see what more you guys bring
662,Blake,"Apr 28, 2022 at 3:24 PM",5,Best Value Fitness on VR,"I’ve tried the ‘big three’ fitness apps currently on the menu – Les Mills, Supernatural and FitXR. Bodycombat is a staple of my use of the Oculus.

Obviously, the biggest advantage this game has is there is no mandatory subscription. There is tremendous value here. 

Supernatural puts the most into the visual environment you train in. And Supernatural and FitXR are releasing new content daily and offer more variety with music. If this is less important to you, as it was for me, Les Mills does what it was designed to help you to do – work out hard - as good or better than the other two apps."
663,Patrick,Sep 6 at 3:47 AM,5,Great workout!,Fun and varied workout! I keep myself in shape and I'm never bored!
664,Sweetcat91,Aug 18 at 5:40 AM,5,Very,"It’s a good workout, as long as you know your own limits and you drink water. It’s mostly focused on cardio, but you can have wrist weights to make it harder."
665,Loulblemo,Sep 9 at 8:45 PM,1,Nice fitness game,Had to change my review as the app stopped working. It's stuck at loading. Not sure where else to provide feedback
666,A K,Aug 14 at 10:36 PM,5,Love this!,"I love this app. I use my Quest 2 for this more than for games tbh. Really like the variety of types, “skill” levels and durations of the exercises! Keep up the great work!"
667,Zen Sean,Aug 31 at 2:02 PM,5,Good workout!,I use a 200lb resistance harness which turns this into a full body workout. Worth the money
668,MakerGeek,Jul 26 at 2:52 PM,4,Good for exercise. Score board is weird,I've been using this for a month or so and find it a great way to work up a sweat. Better than real world body combat classes. But I find the score board bizarre. I'm assuming it's auto generated but the virtual opponents seem to be able to score more points than there are targets. Similarly they can suddenly lose vast amounts. It really doesn't feel connected to my performance or what's possible in the level. You see opponents scoring points when there are no targets. A weird gripe. It doesn't really matter to the purpose of the app. But it is annoying none the less.
669,Malsuharjay,Jul 20 at 7:13 PM,5,Les mills app vs VR,"Was a bit wary of doing VR bodycombat as I've been using the les mills app for years but woah, what a workout!! Great stuff, very sweaty though! Make sure you have the silicone cover on the headset! 💦🥵💦 biceps, forearms, shoulders, all full of the DOMS I LOVE IT! 🤩🤩🤩 Great game/great workouts"
670,HBerserkr,Jun 15 at 1:01 PM,5,Simply the best,"We are talking of one time purchase thing here. So no greedy people trying to get your money every month. This app is my favourite exercise app hands down. I'll be buying any DLC that they release.

Just the fact that there's no subscription, and i can use it anytime, as many times as i want, don't worrying if i do it once a month or everyday. It's just perfect.

Besides love the graphics, the coaches are super motivating and always speaking, at the end of a workout your heart is pumping, simply the best fitness app I've tried, and will continue to use.

Thanks Less Mills 🙏🏻💪🏻"
671,Mister,Jun 15 at 7:50 AM,5,"Really good, but can be better!","So I also tried Fit VR, thats why I can say: I love that Les Mills is a version to buy and not monthly payment coz you never know if you have enough time to use for 8€ monthly payment.

So, Les Mills is way better! Feels fair!

But there is one thing I wish they change with the next update: I really need the coach voices to motivate and remember me, but they are loud af!
It would be cool if you could lower the voices and not only turn them off because they are very useful!"
672,Carla Maria,Jul 31 at 11:56 AM,5,This is the absolute best!,"Wow, what a work out! I absolutely love this game. The coaching is perfect. The game play is amazing! Great cardio, lots of sweat and pain 😄
Only bug is wifi connection. I have to restart to get connected with the internet almost every time."

I took a punt on this and wasn't hopeful but it's totally blew me away, I love it, im feeling fulfilled and broken after a few of these and I hope to keep going and eventually lose weight."
674,Martxc,Sep 3 at 10:40 PM,5,My favorite workout app.,Intense work app that is fun. Just amazing. Worth every penny. FUN.
675,mansouriz,Jul 30 at 9:34 PM,5,Best fitness app on quest 2,"For anyone who enjoys boxing, Les Mills breaks it down in a fun and engaging way. You can also compete with other users which makes it more competitive and fun. Highly recommend it and you’ll be in shape in no time. Best money I’ve ever spent!"
676,Stegoman,Jun 6 at 5:16 AM,5,Great workout app!,"I just started getting into a VR, and one of the first things I wanted to do is try a workout program. I bought this one because it doesn't have a subscription, and yet it does have a lot of variety in the workout sessions that it gives you. They do a great job of encouraging you, and getting you to get used to different body movements, and by the time you are done, you will be sweating!

Awesome VR workout package, and the best deal because of no subscriptions. I hope they keep it that way."
677,Louis,Sep 3 at 3:38 PM,5,C'ant skip the tutorial,Workout is great but why can't I skip the tutorial please fix this
678,Potatohead,Jul 3 at 5:53 AM,5,Time and fatigue doesnt matter in here,"Definitely 5 stars awesome VR app. The moment I start the app time passes very fast as I'm very focused on hitting the targets with good timing, precision and power. I didn't even realize how fatigued I was until its over. Please don't even go for subscription based membership. I don't mind buying more workout plans in future (add on contents) , but please no subscriptions!"
679,Replicant,Jun 24 at 2:24 PM,5,I want to kiss Les Mills!,"Had to quit kickboxing due to a hip injury. I have tried absolutely everything to get me re-motivated. Decided to buy an oculous 2 to mainly play games...I've barely touched the games. Came across this app by accident. It is absolutely genius. It's as close to my kickboxing workouts as you can get. You don't feel like you are exercising, you feel as your dancing whilst playing a fun game. As soon as I finished one round I jumped onto another..didn't want it to end. I just need to go and shower due to the immense amount of sweat!  I actually feel great! Can't wait for the next day to have another go. No subscription neither! However I'd still pay for it if there was. Its worth buying the Oculus just for this app. Exercise is normally boring...this isn't! Bravo Devs!!"
680,Skyrock,Aug 9 at 12:56 AM,5,The best cardio game so far,"Compare to other cardio fitness game on Quest, this one has much more  variety movements and trainer keep talking to encourge me to keep pump up the workout.   No subscription is really nice."

Not masses of space required or any yearly subscriptions 
At least try this and just take your time"

693,Outlast,Jul 11 at 2:05 AM,5,New obsession,"I was so excited to see this in VR, purchased it and set a goal of 30 minutes, 4 days a week thinking that would push me. Ive always had a workout partner at a gym when I worked out so I wasn’t sure how much success I would have working out alone with my VR at home. I have become obsessed and seldom miss a day and rarely work out under 40 minutes a day.  I’ve already seen a significant change and still can’t wait to get home and work out after work! This is amazing!"

696,Wiskosin,Aug 15 at 10:05 AM,4,Perfect cardio workout but...,"It's fine, and the workouts let you k.o. in just a few minutes but it will be perfect if you could use it with free hands, it's annoying that you can't punch right because you have to hold the controls in your hands."
697,Chazzzmd,Jun 23 at 2:43 AM,5,Really good so far,"I'll have to do an update because I've only used it for a couple days now. But it's a great entertaining approach to exercising. The coaches are visually and audio present. The coaches are very vocal throughout the workout and will correctly correct you if you're doing something incorrect. The music they use is good. Plenty of workouts to choose from that match your needs. There are leaderboards and a weekly tracker of your workouts and calories.

The worst thing the powers that be could do to this product is charge monthly/annual fees. The 1 time charge is absolutely what got me to download and will be a driving force for me to continue to use. 

I've been sick for the past 15 months and have gained a lot of weight. I'm not ready to lift weights yet. I never thought working out in VR would be this motivating."
698,GG,Jun 23 at 1:16 AM,5,Great Exercise,"This is definitely a great workout! 
Be prepared to need a head band! : ) for the sweat!
The knee targets are iffy but I try my best to bust them up. You can get lots of squats and lat workout.
Feels like boxing/mma training. 
It’s fun and can be exhausting."
699,Ahmed Hesham,Jun 25 at 1:26 PM,5,Worth every cent!,"This game, well technically it’s more of a home gym than a game, it is a life changer! So engaging and fun, with personal trainer guiding you every step of the way, you will burn hundreds of calories a day while you are challenged and having fun.
Best workout app on the quest, period!."
700,Spbgirl,Aug 25 at 2:49 PM,5,,Love love love this game!  Graphics and music are awesome.
701,DragonWolf,Aug 19 at 3:47 AM,5,Good stress reliever,Use this after a long day of work. Great way to relieve stress and get a good workout.
702,Lester Staples,Jul 28 at 9:10 PM,4,Good But More Short Workouts Please!,"Firstly, it’s a great app and it’s got me working out more!

My only issue is that due to sweating excessively, the longer workouts are no good to me. If I could pause them to have a wipe and a drink, that’d be great. 

To alleviate this problem I do several short workouts, allowing me a break in between to reorg. BUT there’s a limited choice of shorter programmes! 

Oh, and the repetitive commentary is a bit annoying too!"
703,Narciso Monteiro,Jul 7 at 11:32 PM,5,Who said a game isn't real workout?,"I'm sore and tired but I'm happy after completing a routine in expert mode. This is the real thing, burned 600 calories in one hour and I feel getting fitter after using Les Mills daily. 
I usually warm up with Beat Saber or Smash Drums and then do 2 or 3 routines in Les Mills and it's a truly intense workout session.

I tried other fitness apps but stayed with this one, not only because I like it, but also because I can use it without a subscription. Definitely recommend."
704,MamaObamaKiss,Aug 10 at 8:30 PM,1,Infinity loading,Reinstall relaunch also reboot - nothing helps me to play this game. It stucks on the loading screen and that is it for 30$ (((

706,DuhRoses,Jul 6 at 5:40 PM,5,Amazing Workout!,"First: huge respect to the developer for making this a one time purchase. Maybe they are planning on building a base and then converting, but for now, thank you for respecting your users.

Second: this is a legit workout! There isn’t really anything else to say. Your heart will be pounding. Your lungs will be working double. Your arms/shoulders will be screaming. And your legs will get worked as well.

It just works. And it’s fun."
707,Novocaine,Aug 21 at 6:07 AM,4,"No subscription, I buy.","Thanks for not making it the silly monthly subscriptions app. Everything is great, love the app but last star if we can have hand tracking instead of holding the controllers."
708,Rennel,"Mar 23, 2022 at 9:13 AM",5,Puffed after the first 20 min! Love it!,"I picked the Les Mills combat app as it seems to be the only decent fitness program that does not require an ongoing subscription. After reading other reviews and watching YouTube reviews online, I decided to give it a go.
I usually have my personal fitness routine of using an exercise bike followed by free weights every weekday. So, I thought this might be a nice way to break up the routine.

I did the tutorials for 20 minutes and used my heart rate monitor while I did them. I couldn’t believe it. Without even having tried one of the proper workout routines I already hit a higher heart rate than any time in the last three months. I had to stop because I didn’t want my VR headset to get soaked in sweat. LOL.

Wow! What a workout! I will be ditching the exercise bike and replacing it with a 20 minute Les Mills workout instead from now on. 

I am really grateful that this app was available without an ongoing subscription, otherwise I probably would not have tried it out. I hope it stays that way. ￼"
709,SummerWind516,Jul 5 at 4:11 AM,5,Absolutely a keeper!!!,"I've tried some other fitness app in oculus store but Les Mills Body Camp won me over because I don't need to pay subscription to get the full experience.  This is how you get people to workout at home and keep healthy! It gets updated and there's lots of content to work with.  I'm having a blast working out and getting fit as I play this app.  Highly recommended!!!  Thank you so much for not being a cash grab, Les Mills Body Camp!!!"
710,Jmerkado,Aug 2 at 6:18 AM,5,best there is,"I've tried all the workout games on oculus Nothing comes course to the workouts,  the intensity and the flow.  they've incorporated knees i how next is kicks"
711,Drcroc72,Aug 2 at 12:57 AM,5,Just wow,"It's the best training game in occulus. No subscription. And sometime, New exercise appears. Do it 5 times a week, 25-30 minuts and you will going to be in shape"
712,Ari,Jun 27 at 8:03 PM,5,Perfect once I figured out how to mute.,"If you can't get the knees to register, do not try to bring your knee through your hands.  Grab the target and bring both hands down to the outside of your knee, like your trying to throw the target down the outside of your leg. Fixed the problem for me. 

I'm a 43 year old woman in a very small space. I'm roughly 210lbs, and I'm working on fitness. I've already lost about 110 an now I have batwing arms. Weights and bungees are great for focusing on a single muscle, but I HATE working out. Lemme just hit em all at once and get it over with. 

This app does that, but it's FUN. I don't want to stop,but I'm really sore. Requires minimal space, and the workouts engage so many muscles at once. Legs, butt, arms (like the entire circumference of your upper arms will burn), abs, an a lot more.

Pointers are thrown out throughout the workouts, and if you follow them you will really feel a burn. I've only just gotten the game, and I'm starting on beginner, and it's just the right difficulty to get me genuinely sore and tired, but not so long that it's too hard. 

If you don't have much space or you don't have any workout equipment, this is a phenomenal experience. I have a treadmill, weights, and a few other things...........I do this instead of all those right now."
713,Sunset,Jul 31 at 2:33 AM,5,Way better than expected!,Other reviews were great so I shouldn't have been surprised that this is actually a really good and fun workout!  Amazing price and no subscription or other costs!
714,SolGoodBaby,Jul 12 at 6:41 AM,2,Meh supernatural wins my vote,"Goofy “ coaches.” Terrible knee hits. 
Zero interaction if you hit or don’t hit the intended targets.    Coach ….”Yay you!!!”   Really??  I didn’t register that I hit anything , but thanks for the fake cheers.  
The knee targets are ridiculous. Good luck. 
And please.. I do not care to compete against or with randoms.  
Musical background noise that I “may” have enjoyed for about 15 minutes in a club before I left for a better place.  
Lame vr backdrop scenes.  
Absolutely zero interest in participating further.  
I’ve been with supernatural since December. I’ll stay with them.   
Hey devs, take a peek at what a real vr community is!  Yours can’t compare."
715,PanzerJahnzen,Jul 8 at 9:17 PM,5,Great for exercise,I've been using this game for some time now and I've seen great results regarding weight reduction and muscle gains. The trainers are motivating and gameplay is fun. Only thing I would like is to have the option to put in your own music to train to make the game ever greater.
716,Britt Ray,Jul 3 at 3:33 PM,5,This has changed my life,I am on a journey to continue good health for myself! I usually just go to a gym and do 30 mins endurance to try and stay fit. But this is WAY more FUN and also much more of a challenge. I would've never thought working out could be as fun as this. I don't even feel like I'm working out - especially since you can compete with others ! I love Les Mills!
717,Warboy11,Aug 20 at 5:51 PM,5,Amazing,Very good fitness game must have to keep fit. Love it.😄
718,Strsnvirgo,Jul 2 at 4:48 PM,5,Loving it so far!,"I’ll start by saying I hate exercise. I didn’t want to pay a subscription for something I wasn’t sure if I’d use, so when I saw this-it was a good option (no subscription).  
I’ve only used it once (today) but I know I can stick with it! The trainers are phenomenal and make you feel powerful! This workout was fun, like actually fun! It wasn’t a workout pretending to be a game or vice versa—it’s just an actual workout that happens to be fun.  Highly recommend!!!!!"
719,Yasser,Jul 3 at 1:07 AM,5,5 Stars as a first impression,"This is the best fitness app on oculus right now, first I was playing audio trip, audio trip still awesome for me when I am talking about fun, entertainment and cardio for losing weight, but my only problem with audio trip after a while that I was missing workout for my upper body, that is the main reason to try les mills, and yes it is the best workout app I was searching for, I found that i could strengthen my upper body as well as my legs.

Simply this app is well designed to solve the difficult equation between the physical workouts with the virtual reality.

Thanks for the developers, good job 😊"
720,Madidoowop,Aug 14 at 7:22 PM,5,Body Combat Enthusiast,This app is top notch I have Les Mills on Demand but this is next level amazing job!
721,RocknSoul,Aug 4 at 3:05 AM,5,Best VR Workout,"This is perfect for the family and I. Everyone loves it and we do Body Combat every day. In the Best shape of my life, thanks Les!!"
722,SHIBArmy,Jul 1 at 1:33 AM,5,Les is So Much More!!!,"This is an awesome exercise app!

I have afib and a hip issue, but I’m so immersed in the workouts, I’m able to make my way though. There are lots of different workouts and intensity levels, and each is well thought out. During the workouts, the trainers are engaging, and the instructions (though repetitive) are genuinely helpful, especially for beginners like myself. Even the faux multiplayer bots are a nice touch lol.

That said, I wouldn’t mind having another workout environment. It’s not a must-have, but it would be nice. Also, having afib, I wish there were more low intensity workouts or a way to change the intensity of workouts or a way to set intensity modifiers.

But other than those couple wish list items, this is one of the few apps I use regularly. Glad it’s not following the subscription model. Keep up the great work, Devs!!"
723,Zs,Jun 6 at 11:50 PM,5,Now this is the best,I have used this app about since a mounth and this is cool cradio work out. I get tired every time. Sometime I use wrist weight I recommend this way for the litle bit harder training. The music play list is a litle bit poor but it isn't a big deal but I hope the play list will expanding. I miss the rock music :) But as I told it is not a problem just a wish. The bigest advantage for me to after the buying no need subcription. I recommend this app I think this is the best fitness stuff.
724,Shaun Lee,Jul 1 at 6:15 PM,1,A literal exercise in frustration,"Day 8 of my one star review. I average 5.5 days per weekover the past 3 months. It would be rated so so much higher even with the repetitive programs but the frustration has worn me out. 

The hit detector needs to be fixed as does what passes for the scoring system. Desperately. Urgently. It simply engenders frustration. 

If you are going to gamify the experience, it must be a fair system. But the hit detection can make it an exercise in luck. As does the weird scoring system where participants can suddenly jump or drop down the rankings. Is the scouring asynchronous? Who knows?"
725,Emad73,Aug 21 at 9:52 AM,5,Best app for fitness,This app alone justifies buying a VR.

727,GeorgeP01,Jul 19 at 3:26 PM,4,"Really good, needs a couple of tweaks","I've owned this for 3 weeks and am really happy with it.  However would it be possible to have some markers put on the workouts one completes in a session, at least for that session, so that if i do several short ones I can tell which ones i've done.  Other than that am very happy with the app and great its available world wide and is not subscription based."
728,BREAL,Aug 16 at 5:12 AM,5,Didn’t know what to expect,And it is amazing! Great app for working out.
729,ElContador,Jun 25 at 11:03 PM,5,Excellent fitness app!,"I just got this and did about 15 minutes of working out and I'm done for the day. I'm sweaty and my arms are sore.

The app has two different trainers but they're genuine and funny and they feel better than the Supernatural ones... The music so far seems to be stuff commissioned for the app rather than the licensed tracks Sup uses but that doesn't matter because you're so focused on form and timing that you hardly pay attention to the music.

I haven't done any exercises with knee strikes yet .. just the basic one and the bodysmash power boxing one, as I'm easing into this. But so far, I'm super impressed.

Advice? Don't overextend your punches... Let the floating things come to you."
730,Mark Calderon,Aug 7 at 9:43 PM,5,,I enjoyed it it was very entertaining and got you up and into it I'm new to VR
731,Gregg,Jun 23 at 4:03 PM,5,Great workout,"Definite step up from FitVR with addition of knees and multiple punch types . Keeps it more interesting. As long as they don’t ruin it and go to subscription mode like Fit Vr

I would like longer workouts, 30 min or more. And I think there needs to be an extreme one. Yeah you can combine multiple ones but it makes it easier to not do the full time if you have to start new programs"
732,Rob Atlas,Jun 23 at 11:46 PM,5,Good Sweaty Workouts,"Once I had gone over the knee tutorial again it was fine and good, it does have the occasional micro stutter which can mess up your score, but it's still giving you a good workout even if you don't hit the target perfectly.

I would really like to see the vertical scrolling smoothed out when picking your workout, but it's still good as it is."
733,AmandaMyChelle,Jun 30 at 3:06 PM,5,Looking for a Workout? Choose THIS!,"I’ll admit that I am out of shape but this Les Mills game really is a workout for me! I’d been using Supernatural and enjoyed the music variety and scenery but never really feel like I’m getting a full-body workout. I’m a little sweaty but barely winded after a session. And for $19 a month? Seems silly. I downloaded Les Mills on a whim when it was on sale and now I wish I’d found it first. So glad it’s not subscription! Some reviews said the workouts get boring after awhile but…I don’t see how. There are a TON of them! Plus they just added more with the last update. And they mix up your moves and speeds. I also LOVE both trainers. Maybe it’s their accents? Idk but I couldn’t warm up to any of the Supernatural coaches. With Les Mills, within 5-10 minutes I’m out of breath, sweating and ready for a water break. Also I notice some soreness in my arms and thighs the days following my Les Mills workout. I NEVER achieved that with Supernatural even after 6 months of paid subscription service! The only thing I’d like different is popular songs or better music selection but it’s not a dealbreaker for me. I’ve read others who use their Airpods while playing and choose their own playlist and turn the Oculus sound off so that’s always an option or solution . At any rate, absolutely highly recommend Les Mills BodyCombat if you’re looking for a good VR fitness/workout game that will get your heart rate up. EDIT: This one also has Offline mode, so no internet required. However, if you’re the competitive type, with internet you actually compete against others in real time and I’ve found that the competition makes for a better workout as you end up giving more energy to your moves, trying to keep your score up and your name at the top of the list."
734,MarvelB,Jun 23 at 7:20 PM,5,Amazing workouts!,"I love this game so much! It's the reason I bought a Quest 2 and it's the game motivating me to get healthy and fit. I feel fantastic after each workout, and if it weren't for sore arms and shoulders, I'd play for hours. Thanks, LesMills, for this awesome game (and for making it a one time fee and not a subscription)!"
735,italoipo,Jul 10 at 1:17 AM,4,love it..but kinda worried,i love this fitness App atm..but am really worried cause they confirmed a subscription based addon later in time...they said its optional and with no impact for the one that paid now...but i really have trust issues in general with such promises....
736,Pope francis,Jun 27 at 12:21 AM,5,,"Update 6/26/22
I love the update. Keep updating new workout! Maybe add a program to follow. Would love categories of muscle groups. Abs, legs, chest etc. 



Please add better songs and  modern music.  Add programs to follow day by day. Overall, the work out are great. And I'm sore!"

738,CaptainCrumpet,Jun 22 at 9:03 AM,5,The #1 in my view,What a great implementation of the Body Combat program. Love the additional moves over similar games and the tempo is great. I really enjoyed my time with FitXR but this in my opinion is far better. I would however like personally challenges and rewards built into the game. Also please don't charge a subscription and instead opt for paid content or a season pass.
739,Thompson,Jun 22 at 9:31 PM,5,Blew Me Away,"I like to consider myself pretty in shape. I'm 32 I go to the gym 6-7 days a week and am currently in training for my first bodybuilding competition. Today after my gym workout I still had a lot of energy and was going to do a light cool down and play some Beat Saber. When I turned on my headset I saw I down loaded the BodyCombat to the headset so I figured if give it a try. In my mind I'm thinking “ this is going to be a nice cool down “ 43 minutes and 512 calories later did I realize how wrong I was. This had me squatting, punching and sweating like crazy. Definitely not what I was expecting when I started the program. 
I'm super happy because I'm about to go on vacation for 2 weeks and our hotel has a very small gym but thanks to this I don't have to worry. No matter how good or bad the hotel gym is I will be able to sweat and get my heart rate up. 
I would say if you own the Oculus this is a MUST OWN!"
740,Warren,Jul 5 at 3:44 PM,5,My own personal trainer at home!,"A great workout! Just tried this today for the first time, have done karate and Tae Kwon do in my 20s and 30s but now in my 50s and boy do my legs hate those squats! At least I can handle a full session without dying 😁I'm hooked."
741,Coleman Rodriguez,Jun 21 at 6:12 PM,5,😳 !Captivating Workouts! 🥵,"The search for an amazing dedicated workout app is over! For me at least, and I hope to tell you why this is the app for you too.

For context, I workout regularly and had been using BeatSaber in expert/expert+ modes for how hard I wanted to work out. The thought of working out to non-Lady Gaga songs always turned me away from this app, but I decided to give it a try anyway… 😂 

I can confidently say, I am absolutely blown away by the voice guidance in the workouts and have never had a “workout” in VR be so intense and satisfying. This is a solid buy, and there are no ￼accursed subscriptions!!! 10/10 a must buy for anyone looking to get their heart rate up and their oculus meaningful purpose when it come to working out. 

Les Mills, please, please, please, I cannot stress this enough…  Don’t add a subscription models to this app or future ones. I understand the business practice and need for subscriptions but if $$ hinders new content the please do DLC instead of subscriptions. You have hit gold with this app. Please keep your content and business practice on meta platforms in this amazing success you have clearly hit with the community."

It feels really slick and well thought out, I’d held off buying this for a few months, but I should have dived right in, if you’re on the fence and looking for a hard cardio workout just get this. 

It’s a lot more interesting than spinning for similar gains 😵‍💫"
748,Steph,Jul 9 at 10:10 PM,5,My go to!!,"I LOVE this app. It is fun, edgy, and a total butt kicking workout. I’ve done Body Combat in person before and this is very comparable to the classes. So much fun and definitely challenges your workouts."

751,John Nguyen,Jun 19 at 6:09 PM,5,VR BEST Workout game period.,"We need more games like these! I am so glad I found this game and was very hesitant to buy. This game will definitely get you sweating within 5 to 10mins of workingout. The courses are so well designed with great instructor and music. One of the things I am glad they future is that they added other players scoreboard live, which makes the game more immersive. Thank you developers for making this game! If you where to teach me math and science i will buy it lol! Ok I am going off topic, but if we can learns job trades in vr from cooking to medical. Then we are moving in the right direction, I can't wait what you guys develop next. You guys are a life savor❤

Next update request:
-  build your own courses with optional time limit
- add jumping jacks and sit-ups into the exercise
- have live people in the same room, so we can push each others limits by able to talk to each other for motivation 
- have an instructor on the front side to guide your body movements to hitting targets.
- if you can get tae bo into these couses even better
- stretching or warm up exercise courses

Thank yout for your time and consideration :)"

Huge fan! I hope you keep adding workouts and/or sell expansion packs. Please don't make this a subscription!!!
753,Doublethreat,Jul 8 at 4:21 AM,4,Love it…but would love it more if….,"It’s fantastic, gets my heart rate up, it’s so fun you forget that you’re working out.  I hope and pray that it doesn’t turn into a subscription service.   After using it for under a week, twice per day, I find I get tired of the music tracks and although the trainer are motivating, their lines are repetitive.   The knee strikes need a little tweaking because I can barely hit the targets; even after the tutorial. 

Edit: Thank you for the updates and the new workouts they are awesome. I especially like that more squats are incorporated into some of the workouts; more leg/booty focused workouts. 😁"
754,Tee,"Apr 29, 2022 at 1:29 PM",5,Omg Great om every LEVEL,"Let tell ya I got this app with aspersions of maybe I’ll like and get what I need or it will b a complete failure.. let me just say I love this app workout and I’m the kind of guy who works a very physical job and so I usually absolutely no desire to work out in any capacity but after seeing what others said about this app in review I decided to try it! Boy am I so glad I spent the 29.99 for it. After 2 workouts back to back days( completely un normal for me) I find myself excited to get off work and jump on the oculus for my workout. I’ve noticed that so many of the workouts apps want a annual membership and I’m not one to commit to those. It was so nice to see les miles workout didn’t demand that. Please don’t change this in your game app I would happily buy new workout dlcs. This game/workout has got me all in on working out. For anybody in the edge of wanting to buy this. Let me tell you, it works and works extremely well you won’t be disappointed. Happy workouts everyone!!"

I did three workout sessions and when I was done, I was dripping in sweat. My only issue is when you grab the block that you smash on your knee. I had a bit of a problem with that. Also, some of my punches didn't register but either way I'm truly excited about this and hopefully, I’ll have some time to make this a part of my Self Care routine."

I settled on thrill of the fight as my go to app for a cardio work out, while it is a great boxing simulator and great work out, it became a little boring as there is little emphasis on improving technique

I stumbled across this app and decided to give it a try.  At such a low price point I wasn’t expecting much but in reality it is a well thought out and well executed fitness app. There is plenty of content for all fitness levels and the routines focus on technique as well as intensity.

I was impressed at the couching style used that was always encouraging with out ever becoming annoying

Easy to navigate, fun to use and a great work out not to mention a low entry fee without a requirement for an on going subscription cost

Well done!"
759,NikJoeJay,Jul 8 at 6:09 PM,2,Uh…Just okay,"I got this because you can buy it… I like it okay.. just found out how to mute coaches voice so I can workout with the distractions… Its okay… they dont have songs I like… Im not sure if you can create your own playlist of songs and workout (as I havent played to long to see) I like Boxing VR on PS4, because you can pick songs you like and workout… If i dont like the songs, I can’t work… so I guess thats why I can get into the game… the workout itself does make u sweat… but that alone can’t motivate me to keep coming back.."
760,Quinn6463,Jul 5 at 9:15 PM,4,Great!,I just tried for the first time today. I am still a supernatural fan but wanted more variety in workouts. It Definitely made me sweat! I still new to me so I have to get use to it but it was a great workout. I wish it had a companion app so I can see my progress and plan my workouts before I get on the oculus. I know it’s nit picking but just a suggestion. Other then that it was great.
761,Sleepyp,Aug 11 at 9:29 AM,5,,Love it!!!
762,bobojojo,Aug 9 at 10:37 AM,5,Great,Its a great not game
763,Tukster,Jun 14 at 9:07 AM,5,Absolutely the best,Incredible… I also have a subscription on the Less Mills online classes. However this brings the body combat to a total new level. Due to the way you have to hit your targets it makes you have to work harder and better. Combined with the gameplay of others doing the same training and scoring points for hitting correctly with power! If like me you are a bit competitive you like this… you want to win this round.. and the next!
764,Teresa,Jun 14 at 7:07 PM,5,Amazing,"Easy to us, workouts at different levels, it’s fun and challenging, after a few minutes I’m sweating. Good variety of activities to choose from for targeted or full body workouts, super easy to follow.

I definitely need to secure my hands to the controllers and a bigger space as I nearly punched my tv!

Very realistic and immersive and no subscription! I love that you can play against others but you don’t interact with them, it’s just names on a scoreboard for motivation. 

I usually start strong in first or second and end up last lol"
765,Andy Tan,Jul 21 at 7:53 PM,5,,Nice and realistic VR game. Make me want to do more. It really sweat me out and worth it for the 1 time purchase
766,Apocrufex,Jun 15 at 12:38 AM,5,Great workout that’s challenging and fun,"I’ve seen great results in regards to my fitness and stamina playing this 3-4 times a week. Highly recommend for anyone who’s looking for a VR fitness game. It’s motivating, challenging  and so much fun. Looking forward to the new update! Thanks Devs, Les and of course Dan and Rachel!"
767,Julia,Aug 1 at 9:26 PM,5,Totally worth it,I think this app is totally worth it the full price
768,WaistBound,"May 28, 2022 at 11:23 PM",5,Excellent,"I’m currently a truck driver who used to box in the military! Workouts as a truck driver are hard to come by and it was the whole reasoning behind my Oculus purchase! I bought “Thrill of the fight” which for a boxing game, was a pretty good workout! I pummeled all 9 of the combatants on every single level of hardness the game offered so it lost its flair for me. I then proceeded to purchase “Creed” and walked through the story line of that game (huge Rocky fan). I researched every “boxing” workout available and was instantly turned off by the “membership” apps and thought I’d give Les Mills a shot! I wasn’t disappointed! The workouts are genuinely fun, competitive, and their instruction on how to actually punch is right on point! I have limited space to workout without punching cabinets and dash panels LOL and I can do a full body workout with this! I’m feeling soreness in places I forgot could get sore and that’s a good thing! I highly recommend those looking for a great, fun workout to give this a go! Please as others have stated DO NOT make this a membership deal! It’s PERFECT the way it is! Hats off to the creators!"
769,limbsallaccountedfor,"May 27, 2022 at 6:10 PM",5,Fun way to get your heart rate up,"good workout, no subscription, trainers are motivating but after time it gets repetitive, wish they could be volume adjusted and music made louder after you've done the workout multiple times. I really like trying to hit new best scores and like that it shows you over time improvement, would like to see history of calories burned, or more achievements/challenges too. Only issue I have is probably user error... But I can't seem to hit hammer punches, like my arm span isn't wide enough and there doesn't appear to be a way to adjust that, I basically have to choose a side to hit and lose my combo every time.... But unless you have tiny arms like me probably not an issue 😂"
770,Jon,Jun 11 at 11:20 PM,5,Absolutely fantastic!! Buy this!,"I don't normally write reviews but this is just absolutely fantastic, the workouts are great fun, really feel the effects of them, the two people guiding you through them have great personalities and nothing feels fake or forced as they talk to you. Being able to see other people's scores as your working out really helps to push you that little bit further too.

Genuinely the best thing I have on VR right now!"
771,Namtango,Jun 16 at 1:54 AM,2,So broken.,"The bugs and awfully poor design choices stops this from being good.
Asking someone to smash their controllers into their knee is insane.
The same goes for the uppercut.
Are you guys aware that we can't see our actual bodies while playing this?
This is mind-numbingly dumb."
772,Anson Chew,Jul 13 at 8:34 AM,2,Unable to re-enter your screen & bugs,"This is my first purchase app in the Quest 2. Overall the app gives an acceptable workout. However there were some issues that need to be address: 
1) Unable to re-enter your screen
2) App not able to register below the knee moves
3) Delayed registered hits"
773,Viniati,Jun 20 at 7:20 PM,5,Simply the Best,"This is by far the best workout experience that you can get on quest - I’m someone in really good shape & can easily get my heart rate up to 175 no problem within 17 min 🙂. Good stuff!! Keep the content coming, I’m telling everyone about this app"
774,Vixxx,Jun 17 at 11:03 AM,1,Not challenging..,"I tried this app on expert level the day I purchased it and it was far from challenging, not to mention the graphics aren't very good, and music is definitely not on the top 10 hits list..
I'm pretty disappointed and will be requesting a refund..I won't be suggesting to others sadly.."
775,Sonny Cave,Jul 1 at 7:39 AM,4,"Very Good App, Needs Some Improvements","Rachel and Dan from LesMills make this an enjoyable and challenging workout app, with a variety of easy and fun sessions plus more intense options for serious cardio and hand-eye coordination exercises. The virtual gym graphics are nice although vary a bit more to spruce up the experience. The hand controller/target interface in the programming is not always well synchronized causing “missed punches” that were actually “hits”. In connection with these asynchronous glitches the controller glove graphic sometimes goes limp or disappears. I don’t have this issue with other programs that use similar controller motion, so am thinking it is a BodyCombat phenomenon. The other area for improvement is with the online/offline consistency issue mentioned in some of the support forums. Sometimes the program can inexplicably only be played offline which causes diminished features such as other player info and leaderboard tracking. Notwithstanding these areas of needed improvement, overall this is actually a quite nice app; it has become my predominant “go to” indoor exercise routine (and on the back porch deck as well!)"
776,Dluv,"Mar 10, 2022 at 7:24 AM",5,No Subscription. Enough said....,If you are on a fitness journey and you own an oculus this is a must buy. It's my go to app. The trainers are so motivating and the leader board keeps your competive spirit going. I can't explain it. It is something you will  have to experience. I have lost 20 pounds since January. You will see noticeable progress if you are consistent. There are low intensity workouts and high intensity.
777,Maco,"Mar 29, 2022 at 6:52 AM",5,I just finished my first workout and…,"It was intense. I am a frequent Supernatural and Beat Saber user so I thought this would be a piece of cake. I was wrong. This will have you moving your whole body and have you sweating and heavy breathing and at the end you will be proud of yourself because you didn’t know if you would finish the workout. Okay maybe not everybody but I promise you this is worth it 10x over. A wonderful addition to Oculus and a no brainer when you look at the cost to value. Buy IT NOW. do it for yourself, your body will thank you later."
778,FitProVR,"Feb 3, 2022 at 8:01 PM",5,Easily the Best Fitness Experience on Q2,"Take it from me, a guy whose channel literally ONLY reviews fitness games on youtube, this IS the best fitness experience to ever grace the quest 2. The coaches are motivating, the workouts make sense, it’s a one time buy with an optional subscription. Odders and Les Mills really knocked it out of the park with this game. No complaints, well done.
Side note: Don’t follow the path with the knees, hold the little robot jawn up high, and then slam it to your knee. It can get confusing if you’re struggling with the knees.

779,Craig,Jul 12 at 11:15 PM,5,Love it!!!,This is an EXCELLENT work out app.   Fun but very challenging.  I use it several mornings a week.  Can’t recommend it enough!
780,Megaram505,Jul 22 at 4:45 PM,5,Great for more mature folks.,I am liking this app. It great for someone my age(60+). I am starting low intensity & taking my time working up
781,Eiann03,Jun 7 at 10:49 AM,5,Great Gym replacement without Gym Fees!,"Unlike FITXR, this game offers similar great workouts for a single time purchase. It even managed to make a smart way of making you move your legs even without leg tracking, giving you a full body workout.

It even comes with built in calorie tracker giving you a good estimate of your exertion in game. More fitness games should stop bleeding customers' of their hard earned money and instead help us bleed off calories of our waists."
782,Maxppc,Jun 16 at 12:30 PM,5,"Best ever, motivating, various, updated",Everything I could ever hope from a fitness game. Keeps me motivated with two hosts that follow you during every session. Many lessons with different levels. One time payment game really worth the money. Updates coming often too. This is just perfect!
783,Kyler Clayton,Aug 2 at 12:00 AM,5,Excellent,It's awesome! Love it
784,Chris C,Jun 26 at 7:54 AM,5,Awesome App,"I take Body Combat at the gym and this app takes a new level. Love it and really enjoy the virtual workout. Highly recommend getting it. If you can’t make it to the gym, this is a great alternative."
785,Jorge,Jun 5 at 11:24 PM,5,Love the feedback!,"If you’ve done Combat before this is a no brainer; if not, try this. Yes there are other boxing fitness apps but Dan and Rache have been doing this for a long time and are super motivational. I also really love the real time relevant input they provide (not just unrelated motivation, but tips based on what you are doing).
Plus it’s cool that you are in a room with other boxers (kind of, you only seen the avatars in the beginning but there is a scoreboard so you have some competition!)
I only wish the target colors were different- a bit hard to remember what purple and green corresponds to (for me anyway)
And no sub!!"
786,Darkerius,Jul 26 at 6:29 PM,5,The best fitness app,Just The best fitness app i used until today
787,Mini,Jun 9 at 6:29 PM,5,"Send me to rehab, I am ADDICTED","Fitness and fun wrapped up in 1.  There is a variety of workouts and new ones are added.   Workouts for  beginners to advanced.  Description includes intensity, time and body move.  When working out stay motivated with score and streak.  So glad there is no subscription needed."
788,Deadpoint,"Apr 30, 2022 at 8:07 PM",5,Best non-subscription fitness app.,"Les Mills is definitely the best non-subscription fitness app. One thing about this app that I thought I would hate but ended up liking a lot is the coaches ""talking"" to you during your workouts. The jokes get old but I did find the instructions on what punches are coming next and how you should punch the targets helpful. I highly recommend this app."
789,Starbreak,Jun 3 at 7:42 PM,5,Very good excersize program,"Im 170cm high and was 100kg in weight. I hate gyms and feel very uncomfortable while I train next to others. This game is perfect for this problem. You train alone, but you always getting encouraged by the virtual trainers, and it can burn 400-600 kcal with around 45 mins. At least my Mi band 6 tells this data. My heart rate is usually 140-160 average and can spike up to 180 peak. Im not using any pills and with some attention over my food, I lost 3 kg in one month. I recommend it to anyone who wanna get some basic fitness."
790,Hos,Jul 31 at 10:27 AM,2,Annoying commentary,This would be a great game if the coaches didnt talk 24/7 during workout and i cant turn their voice off and listen to the music
791,YoloGamingTech,Jul 23 at 8:51 AM,5,Best App Ever,I have tried it. Never felt so motivated and good
792,Morgenstern74,Jul 13 at 7:00 PM,5,Absolutely awesome!,The best fitness app on Quest Store. Simply great. You have to try this out. It’s unbelievable.
793,Gypsy,Jun 30 at 8:53 PM,2,Potential is there but not quite ready,"For me, the targets are always a bit off especially for the knees. It never hits the target no matter how hard I try. I did Muay Thai for years so I know it's not just me. 
I ended up going with Supernatural boxing because I prefer that platform and the accuracy of the targets much better. 
I'm much less likely to use an app when the targets are that far off. Sorry it had potential but this app needs work before it's ready for purchase."
794,Malencroix,Jun 20 at 10:28 PM,5,Great!!!,"I have been using this for about a month and it is great!  I get a great workout, don't pay a subscription fee and find the coaching excellent.  It doesn't gav the latest pop tunes, but I didn't buy it for that."
795,DoomRoman,Jun 28 at 11:26 PM,5,Amazing!!!,"If you looking for great workout experience Les Mills VR is the app that you need, it got short, medium and long sections of exercise that would definitely make you sweat."
796,Kingchim,Jun 4 at 9:42 PM,5,Wow 👏 👍,"A really good game  . I just bought  it couple of days and got hook 🪝  no pun intended. The scoreboard is a motivator. The music is synch with the workout . Well done 👏 , Magnifique, Bravo. Please no subscription!!! If you have Dlc happening every year or couple of months men no other workout game can't compete. 

Great game 👏 👌"
797,Chimi,Jun 22 at 5:18 AM,4,Great! Active! A few suggestions.,"Love it! Great workout! One thing I would do is add a few more settings maybe a solo time trial where you keep going until you mess up, or a versus mode for 1 on 1 with friends. Maybe a change in music get some popular songs you can just groove to while you work out. Missions would be fun too! keep it more interactive that way. Still fun though but has the potential to be amazing!"
798,FleshyMonkey,Jun 22 at 4:22 AM,4,"Pretty good, and only a one-time fee","These workouts are pretty good, at least as good as Supernatural, with the significant advantage of only costing a one-time fee.  I took a star off because the trainers never stop talking and unfortunately they are very, very repetitive.  It would be really great to be able to turn them off and just workout to the music, but as of this review, you can't.  Even from one workout to the next, it seems they recycle some of the same phrases.  Anyway, still good for sweating a bit in VR and I endorse the one-time fee concept!"
799,Zanderthefirst,"May 1, 2022 at 11:33 PM",5,Great Product,"I wasn’t sure how much of a work out I’d really get but thought I’d give it a go based on the good reviews. I’m so glad I did! It makes you sweat, leaves your muscles tired and is fun. You can monitor your progression and there’s a good variety of choices within each intensity level. I’d recommend this product."
800,Ismail,Jul 24 at 7:00 PM,5,Great work out app,Great coaches and workouts.
801,Skitless,Jun 20 at 3:52 AM,4,Great fitness game,For someone who got vr to help become more active again and lose weight. This is amazing has something for everyone from completely out of shape to workout daily.  Been using this scince feb and slowly progressing threw the intensity  levels. 1 time buy no subs yet . The music is decent only and instructors are good but you will notice they say the same thing if you repeat  the same workout which is bit annoying.
802,Jesse,"May 30, 2022 at 8:19 PM",5,Nearly perfect!,"Fantastic fitness app. Great variety and works up a sweat. Sometimes I feel like the knee strikes are a bit hard to register, might be user error (sole complaint overall). To echo another user, please don't do subscriptions. I'd consider DLC, but if it ever goes subscription model I'd probably stop using it."

808,Richard Hoban,"May 29, 2022 at 1:29 AM",5,Love it,"If you want a fun but serious full body boxing workout this is a must. Great cardio but excellent for targeting a lot of muscles. I do this and supernatural boxing too. This feels more like a full blown workout while supernatural is more just shadowboxing to fun music. If I could only take one it would be this hands down as I like results from my workouts first and foremost(as long as it retains an element of fun) but it is also fun too. The price is a steal, and this will make you a better fighter than supernatural no doubt. This company has been around since 1968, while supernatural is fairly new. They know about fitness. I like to do supernatural too because of the music and the speed boxing is a different dynamic, as well as I love some of the flow workouts too."
809,Withanie,"May 3, 2022 at 11:30 PM",5,Play 5 x a week great value for money,"I love this game it’s really helping with my mental health as well as physical I force myself to do a workout in the mornings and I’m amazed at how much I’ve improved in terms of what I can handle. The first time I had a go I found the 5 min easy workout hard I’ve now progressed to 25 min intermediate workouts ! I get such a buzz knowing I’ve started the day on a high and it is helping me to lose weight along side being mindful of my diet. I’ve lost 27 lbs so far about a lb or two a week.  
I’m so impressed with the value for money the subscription services really put me off on other apps. The latest update is great quite a few new workouts added which was such a bonus. I also love that there are different profiles my husband and daughters all use it as well. 
I would like if it there was a multiplayer option so you and a friend could work out together - I start a party and we both turn the voices off and try and press the button so we start our workout at about the same time but it is fun to do it with a friend and encourage eachother along/ laugh when we mess up.  I think it would also be good to have a more detailed / clearer score card area showing your high score , recently completed work outs with pbs for different workouts etc. it would also be amazing to have workout plans to follow to build fitness / lose weight. 
I thoroughly recommend this app 🤩 thanks 👌🏻"
810,Richy,Jun 23 at 11:02 PM,5,My favorite App,I don't play an app more often than this one. The workouts could be a bit more challenging. I always do a long workout followed by a medium workout. It's just fun.
811,sh6ggy,Jun 16 at 11:27 PM,5,Like Beatsaber but not Beatsaber,This game is a lot like beat saber like hitting objects while doing various movements. In Beatsaber you have to squat when the red zones appear it’s like Les Mills. I think Les Mills is better!!!

And - oh gosh - those environments are awesome! I would love to play a quest game in that cave steampunk city from the recent workouts.

815,Hurleymacfar,"May 26, 2022 at 2:56 PM",5,Outstanding,"After using fit XR and boxVR for a while and finding them a bit limited/basic I purchased this... It's at a whole different level. The graphics, UI and sessions are way better. Plus unlike fit XR everything is included in the price you initially pay. There are multiple different moves to use that really give you a workout especially at the higher levels. Your accuracy needs to be good as well. Wait til the targets get really close and then strike... Wildly swinging or punching too early will mean a failed strike. Highly recommended for whether you want to train or just workout. If you click on your profile and click right you can turn off the coaches voices  (I quickly found their 'input' annoying). Obviously some people will find them encouraging. I train everyday and LesMills makes a physical and mental difference 👊💪"
816,Brian Bearden,Jun 30 at 9:34 PM,3,Not bad,I like this app a lot but I’m a little disappointed in the consistency of it picking up the strikes. Some times it doesn’t pick them up and other times it works just fine. Over all I really like this app and will continue to use it.

suggestions:
1. please take out the ""ooh so close so far"" end-of-run commentary, it's really deflating
2. please add a tutorial video on how to properly strike incoming blocks, maybe just on YouTube or something.  i  have no idea if I'm doing any of the punches right.
3. please add WARM UP routines, sometimes i forget to warm up and go into high intensity and sprain/pull something
4. more ""bad"" players in the concurrent user list if possible, sometimes on hard i am giving my best and still come out in the cellar

I am not disappointed. I really struggle going to the gym. In all honesty I hate the gym. I get anxious and bored after spending about 3 total minutes on a treadmill or any workout tool so when I started using this app, I found myself immersed and entertained the whole time. I totally love it! I’m documenting my 30day challenge on Tiktok because this time I know I’m sticking to it. I would also like to add that I’ve never sweat like this in my life. I had to get another set of silicon covers for my vr set. I’m also thinking of investing in a vent fan to help with the occasional fogging up. Thank you for creating such an awesome app! I love that the pay is affordable but saying this, I am also happy to pay towards any extra features and also to support this app. So ping me when you have something lined up!"
824,Sy,"Apr 18, 2022 at 4:00 AM",5,Sweating off the last 2 years,"I loathed the idea of traditional fitness.  So I got a Quest.

Beat Saber got me started and is fun, but once you learn the songs, you'll find you aren't moving to chase notes anymore, standing still and moving your wrists.  You're playing, but you aren't exercising.

Thrill of the Fight got me sweating, but I don't have the form to do well in that game yet, and it wasn't fun.

LesMills is the best of both:  fun and sweating. I'm feeling the burn in my shoulders and legs from low-intensity workouts, and I have the motivation to work in medium-intensity exercises too.  If you aren't competitive, don't worry:  The leaderboard you see on the right is actually not live people, and you can easily turn off ""social"" mode to hide the leaderboard.  That said, even with that knowledge, I still want to keep going to be in ""first"".  I wouldn't mind a true social/multiplayer mode to play with my wife, but the game is new and I enjoy it for what it is.

Just today they added five new workouts (35 total) and more optional tutorials.  $30 is worth the experience.  Go for it."

826,Smokes,Jul 7 at 3:35 AM,2,More striking combat needed,Good workout however I had having to squat everytime because the headset always slides around as I’m sweating. Wish there was just more striking exercises instead of adding squats and knees.
827,Statham,"Feb 4, 2022 at 2:51 AM",5,First impression - A Knockout,"I mainly use VR for boxing-based / martial arts workouts so I’ve tried most. Based on the tutorial and 10 min workout I did this morning, this is the best I’ve seen.                                                                        

You can tell that this is an app created by people whose business is fitness. That means you don’t just get a random spray of virtual targets to hit, but combos designed to challenge you.                        

The coaches (love the kiwi accents) are giving you tips and guidance as you go, which actually pushes you, rather than just random comments. The app works, with crisp graphics and no long load times. I found the workout fun and can’t wait to do it again.

HOWEVER, the ultimate test of a fitness app for me is how fit it will get me (I know some folks get fit through doing hours of low-intensity gaming, but most of the time I’m looking for ten minutes of tough stuff before work). THE GOOD NEWS is that it got my heart rate right up to peak, which is everything I could want, with lower and higher intensities available.

I can see myself using this for a long time to come and on a daily basis. 

I understand a subscription is expected at some time with this app but we will get to keep the base game. That’s fine and it’s better to be upfront about it rather than spring it on users, but  I hope there’s no forced trial (like FItXR made the horrible mistake of doing to its users) as I’d rather buy expansions or stick with something that’s working for me.

However, just because a competitor made a terrible error, I saw no reason not to get this app as the Les Mills folks seem to know what they’re doing. 

If you’re into VR fitness, this is a great app."
828,mel,"May 22, 2022 at 5:37 PM",5,Addicted,"I knew of Les Mills from their YouTube videos, so to purchase this was a no-brainer for me. I am so glad I did. I consider myself pretty fit, and these workouts provided a welcomed challenge to me. And the workouts are SO FUN. Such a great experience. I use this and Holofit, but I seem to be using this more and more."

835,Jared,"May 17, 2022 at 4:30 AM",5,Best workout app available for the Q2,"This app is an absolute must have. It’s similar to supernatural but with additional clever moves and mechanics to work out additional muscle groups and get you moving more. They also added an effective way to keep you motivated (or if you're overly competitive, burn  yourself out faster) by showing a scoreboard displaying your score versus other people doing the same workout. Afterwards they break down all of your stats even show burned calories which I prefer versus supernatural's point system. 

Most importantly, there isn't a crazy subscription  you have to pay to use it (hope it stays this way). Overall, this is an awesome app and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a challenging workout"

I love the trainings proposed, I do the Start by ten minutes three times per day, then some other excercise without Oculus. I love the training proposed and my commitment grown every day. If you are a begginer or intermediate you will love this app, just go for it."
838,GratefulLizzie,"May 26, 2022 at 12:15 AM",5,Loving it,"I’d been using the free version of XR Fit and getting bored so after reading all the great reviews of Les Mills, I went for it. Did my first hour tonight and loved it. I was exhausted afterwards and felt I’d had a real body workout. I’m now a huge fan!"
839,gubgub,"May 4, 2022 at 5:19 AM",1,Still bad,No ability to notice if you don’t have a skill.  Praises or makes generic comments.  It would help if the program noticed lack of mastery of a skill and suggested a tutorial.  I am doing the knees wrong and missed all of them but one.   Program gave praise and said how I climbed up the leaderboard.   Made it more irritating.   Potentially a decent program but you can see they put very little into it to make it more usable.   Are there any other tutorials for knees other than the one basic one?
840,Berticus,"May 18, 2022 at 1:09 AM",5,"No subscriptions, Perfect workout!","This is where you need to end up after you burn 🔥 twenty bucks on the other guys subscription plan. Great workout, good jams and encouraging trainers.

Also, if you're like me and mainly did boxing workouts on other apps, the fight moves here expand into mma style and are a legit workout."
841,Tracy,Jun 5 at 6:28 AM,4,Definitely a work out!,"After 20 min I could definitely tell I’d been working out. 
The graphics are really nice. 
The music was ok. The work outs were really really good. As a beginner I wish they had a session were you can practice hitting the targets and it would correct or guide you to hit the targets correctly so that the rings grow. I gained points on upper cuts and cross body but lost my place in the leader board every time I had to punch straight. So I know it’s my technique. I would recommend this game 100% to everyone who wants a true workout."
842,Gilbs,"Apr 30, 2022 at 9:59 PM",5,So much fun! Great variety!,"If you're looking to start working out with your quest, look no further. No subscription!! I just started this last week and absolutely love it. The coaches are awesome and help you keep form throughout the workouts so you get the most out of each workout. The best part is the levels that you can work toward. There are levels for anyone no matter your fitness level. I'm looking forward to seeing results and making this apart of my weekly routine moving forward!"
843,Light,Jun 4 at 7:19 PM,4,"Awesome, but some feature missing","Let me start by saying this app is an awesome experience. I've tried the popular fitness app on the store and this one has one big feature that makes it different from the others : an immediate feedback on the force that you're using to hit the target, in the form of a visual cue (rings that pop). This feature pushes you to really hit the target hard, and for me there's no other fitness app on the market right now (except Thrill of the fight, but it's fairly different) that get me going with power like that.

The addition of a live leaderboard of people doing the same workout as you is great, it gives you an incentive to continue to make an effort to stay on track and not fell behind the group. 

However, the gamification side is lacking the absence of real stats that you can consult once your workout is done. For example, I would love to be able to see what was my previous workout completed, what was my score, at what position I've finished, how many times did I finish first, etc. The level system right now gives you XP but it doesn’t give you any sense of real meaning or progression, because we're not able to compare it to something else. Am I doing well vs. others? How's my progress? We don't have that information. It feels that the level system is only there because, well it needed to be there. 

If you could also get a trophy/achievement, it would be huge to replayability. Everything else is great, the workout is AWESOME, the coaches are helpful and the app design is great. If the devs could add the finishing touch mentioned above on the game, it would really be a 5-star experience."
844,AnnaSofia,Jul 11 at 2:34 AM,4,Great!,"I don't know why I like it so much more than FitXR, but I do...
I just wish it had a warm up and cool down session!"
845,Gergo,"Feb 10, 2022 at 8:17 PM",5,TOP VR fitness game,"Updated review after one week of daily 40 minutes:

This is the best VR fitness game to date. I was team FitXR until now, the legacy BoxVR+DLC classes make it a rich no-subscription option for me, but Les Mills BC made me switch. My reasons:

► Feels like a more complete workout with new moves like double punches (T, sky etc), battle ropes and knee smash punch is amazing!
► Drink breaks every 5 minutes is very well implemented
► Class progress presentation is very clear
► Trainers are much more personal
► Menu selection is well done
► Fun to see my shadow on the walls (a bit of OhShape feel!)

I do 3 classes each day, about 40-45 minutes. After a week however I am beginning to run out of new classes, especially because parts of classes repeat in other classes. The commentary becomes repetitious. It would be good to be able to turn it off or maybe trainers should also comment on our actual hits and misses, it is all prerecorded now.

Original first impressions (Feb 3):

I bought my Quest 2 to get in shape. Shed 50lbs in a year: I tried and use every and any app in the store (and App Lab), you name it. I had to be one of the first to try Les Mills BC. I have to say, very good first impressions:

- Unlike many other VR fitness experiences, this is very personal, the coaches are really there they are very approachable
- Surroundings are unique, I wouldn't say beautiful, more utilitarian. But all is beautifully presented.
- Rich, high variety content

How is it different?

The good news: it is indeed different from everything I've tried to date. Even different from other rhythm based boxing experiences (subscription or pay once):

- new stance variants
- many new movement types
- very comprehensive training instructions throughout the class

It is definitely worth our attention, even if already tried everything that came before this. I plan to switch to this game for February, and decide to stick around or move back to my existing workout games at the end of the month."

849,McMalaka,"Apr 30, 2022 at 12:45 AM",4,Awesome App,"I love everything about this game. There is so many movements and you will work up a huge sweat. I have been using this for a month now and lost 15 pounds. 

ONE THING MISSING: I have ACL issues and squats are not good for my knee. Would it be possible to add a feature where you can remove what you can’t do due to limitations  ? If I could remove squats until I am able to do them again , it would make it so much easier to use this ALL THE TIME. 

Love the app, and still this it’s a must have for workout!"
850,Jeorge,"May 12, 2022 at 7:08 AM",3,"Over all great, but not perfect","Over all I think this is a great alternative to subscription based apps like supernatural.  But really annoyed at times at make up of some of the workouts. One beginner work out I was doing. I was at the top of the leader board , almost 20000 in the lead in fact. Then some hammer throws / shots came up without any heads up and I dropped to the bottom of the pack because I hadn’t learned how to hit them properly. Another workout on level two I was doing fine the first half. Then out of no where I was expected to do 65 punches in rapid succession. I’m doing this to try to get in shape. Not because I’m in shape already. Why couldn’t it start with like 30 or something then later I. The workout double it. Especially when I try to do more than just a 5 min workout on one night I don’t have enough energy to throw 65 rapid succession punches all timed and aimed right. Very disappointing quit the workout and tried something else."

857,EpiXan,"Mar 12, 2022 at 10:27 PM",5,Best VR Fitness And No Subscription?,"Talk about the best of both worlds!  I've tried Supernatural and BoxVR/FitXR (I had BoxVR before it morphed into FitXR and continued using FitXR after that) and I genuinely prefer Les Mills Body Combat over the rest.  The lower intensities felt too easy, and the higher intensities kicked the crap out of me so there's absolutely a setting for everyone.  The coaches do a great job of not talking too much as to be distracting, but it's nice that they announce when there's a quick transition from say 8 jabs in a row then suddenly it's hooks or uppercuts.

The knees took me a bit to adjust to, but they really add to the experience.  I would like the option to turn off sky punches (low ceiling) as well as the option to turn off the trainer voices as I think they could get a bit repetitive over time.

Great work Les Mills team!"
858,CMommy,Jun 27 at 12:39 PM,5,Awesome workouts!,"Whew! Great workouts for all levels, even extreme athletes!"
859,Kopper,"Feb 5, 2022 at 10:28 PM",5,Best on Quest! It is that simple!!!!,"As long as the developer doesn’t become greedy and keeps this as a buy once game it will remain at the top. Sure an update every few months with new movements, exercises, and sessions would be welcome but don’t ruin a good thing like so many others. 

I workout 3-6 times a week and the more advanced classes had my heart rate pumping up near 180. I love the leader board where you compete with 5 avatars. It pushes me to stay at the top and to keep up the pace. 

Some may not like the constant coaching but it helps keep me motivated and also keep me focused on doing the exercises correctly!  Just as I start to slop the coach chimes in as if they were actually taking on sensor data to prompt coaching. 

The game is polished, the menus easy to use, there are guest profiles and 3 levels of difficulty. While there are only 20-30 classes this is still worth the price of entry. A buck a class isn’t bad at all. 


While I hope they continue to drip out content it would be great if they had free updates (maybe 1 class a week) but also paid courses with out favorite coaches (for example $9.99 for 15 classes). Over time the actual game and platform could continue to be expanded with new movements. That the new classes Take advantage of.

What is here is perfection. The classes are well paced and put together. The sensors work perfectly and I love competing with others.


Les Mills is perfect please developer I am begging you take my suggestions for the future of the game and do not become greedy and flip to monthly once you build a community. We the community will remain loyal and purchase class packs or new versions. We have been waiting for an honest company to develop a great fitness game and so far so good!"

861,KJ,Jun 18 at 3:42 AM,3,Needs Les Mills music,Its good and fun but i think the one thing that stops me from using it more is the fact it hasnt got any les mils body combat music in the workouts. shame !!! If it had that id give this game a 5 start.
862,Onicus Rex,"May 6, 2022 at 7:53 PM",5,Great Workout. Great Price.,"This is one of the best fighting/MMA style workout apps on the market. Interactive, fun, challenging, and rewarding. I like that the harder and more accurate your punch, the higher the score. I like that it incorporates knees, weaves, and ducking. Also blends crossfit style movements like battle rope throws.

The only thing I'd like to see is the addition of blocks... high blocks, low blocks, hook blocks, kick blocks... something where the move comes at you and you are forced to react.

That may be too much to ask from a pay-once-to-own app, but I'll take the exclusion of blocks over another subscription app any day."
863,Lidvale,"May 7, 2022 at 12:02 AM",5,Great Experience,This is a great place to start your exercise in VR. You can work to move up the leaderboard. If you are just starting I would recommend not worrying about the leaderboard but on technique and movement. This will still get you sweating and allow you to increase the intensity as you improve then move up the leaderboard. Feels very accurate and the music tempo is great.
864,ofwerman,"May 6, 2022 at 9:10 AM",5,Great workout,"I like this one and it makes me sweat. I used FitXR before, but that one was subdcription based, which Les Mills isn’t and that’s also great. I like the app and the graphics. One thing I miss though, is to pick someone to do your workout with. It would be great to do one together with someone else in real life, not just the ones showing on the screen now, but with a friend or having your girlfriend working out next to you and try to beat each others scores. That would be a great addition for the next update.
But Les Mills Body Combat is great as it is. And it works."
865,Alexis,"May 5, 2022 at 4:07 AM",5,Wow…wow…wow supernatural VS Bodycimbat,"So I started using supernatural and yes it’s a subscription with that and I loved it. But I didn’t want to get bored using just that platform form so I decide to buy the body combat and boy I am so glad I did. I don’t have another subscription and the workout is amazing. I love the workouts it makes you feel like you are not alone. I love the competition with others, it makes me push even harder to be first. I seriously just purchased this today and I enjoyed it so much I did three workout programs in one day and I am ready for another round. It will have you sweating, huffing and puffing but in the end you are like WOW. I feel like this is another great platform for me to expand my weight loss journey. I literally have a full on gym with a sauna and since I have purchased both platforms I have not step foot in my gym except to dust it. LOL..just do it! You won’t regret it! 

Difference between the two. supernatural is a subscription and they have a lot of pretty destinations that make you want to workout, feel at peace and the music is awesome.


Body combat no subscription, same location, but you get to compete when starting your session, more ALL body movements, music is okay. 

Both great platforms. It really just depends how you are feeling that day."

869,VRDanLopez,"Apr 27, 2022 at 7:31 AM",5,Great Effing workout!,"My wife and I love this workout app.  It really does work up a sweat and it is put together very nicely.  

There is always room for improvement and I believe they will continue to work to improve as necessary.  

In my opinion if they want to go with the subscription model that would be fine for those who want it, but also include new free workouts to keep the app fresh. I think charging a one time minimal fee for new DLC or ""workout packs"" will keep everyone happy. 

I have a few suggestions.

1. I would like to see workouts organized by targeted musle groups and maybe a detail picture in the description of the specific musles targeted in the workout.

2. Possibly using several different filters for an example by duration, intensity, and targeted musles groups to help zone in on desired workouts in less time.   

3. The ability to set realistic goals with trackable progress that will curate tailored workouts and routines to help the user achieve desired results. Whether it is weight loss, endurance, getting shredded or targeting problem areas. 

4. Have the coaches illustrate every move in more detail to ensure that the movements are done correctly to maximize the effectiveness of the workout.   

5. Incorporate some jumping in the workouts. 

6. Live workout sessions for subscribers. 

Otherwise, great job! 5 stars!"

872,SarahSlurpie,"Feb 15, 2022 at 1:21 PM",5,Goodbye for now supernatural😌,"This is way too fun . 🤩🥊😝
A full  body VR workout ! (even on the low levels ).! 😍 I was skeptical after reading some reviews and coming from multiple other workout games which I love but I wanted to give this a chance , and I don’t regret buying it 
~~~~~~
I love that you can feel the targets when hit , your shadow appears on the boxes so u can see if how much to move out of the way kinda fun ! The trainers are there to remind you which way to hit the targets each round without telling their life story lol during each hit,   circles appear based on your  your hit strength which is great and there are so many sessions to choose from ! 🤓🥳😎
Yeah, The targets can be hit or miss and you’ll see your score bounce around on the chart  . 🎯
 Fortunately for me I just keep going regardless of the score, but it can be a drag to a user I’m sure to know you hit one and it registered otherwise . (You have to really customize your guardian ) but it’s not horrible so I’m not fully complaining 😬🥲

Now while  I’m glad the trainers don’t just talk about things irrelevant to the user and fill you in on their life story and what they had to eat for the day lol  , they def get annoying with the same lines and at times I wouldn’t mind knowing about their day at that point !! Hahahah 🗣🙊😆

and it’s almost border line annoying after so many diff sessions the repetitive motivation script that the trainers say on each session is insane (wish I could drown it out almost ) hahaha but they also remind you to not quit which ya gotta admit can be helpful as well as how much time is left  ! (If only it wasn’t so repetitive) lol 📝
♥️
Thankfully the beats 🎵 alone keep u motivated to keep going ! I thought I wouldn’t like this without current or hit song but honestly once u get into session ur mind doesn’t even focus on what’s playing other than the beat ! 
~~~~~~~~

Main Downsides : missing quite a few targets that should have been hit . However I love that the targets “kerplunk” to their death if you do actually happen miss them hahaha 🤪 

🤞🏼I wish there was a way to somewhere scan your arm outward measurements . I swear when trying to hit the out side doubles at the same time my arms are almost too Short and so I’m constantly only hitting one side instead . Loooll

The knee targets, once you get the hang,  arnt that bad which after reading comments almost made me weary . You have to grab em then pull down like an old school pelvic thrust move without the thrust lol then stop and then slam into the target after the trail ends :) they turn out to be the most timid movement in the whole game haha but they are a fun new little movement I think lol 😆

The down punches are the ones that make me 🐯 grr ! Sometimes I get them spot on but I think one session I did they were perfect and a diff sesh I missed nearly all of them and also felt like they were Off beat 🥲, but same time I didn’t mind but it was a bit frustrating . 😌

Diff backgrounds would be a huge plus as the the same gyms are dull but I don’t mind it . 

It’s nice that it has the option to  pause the game (which is handy) 
EXCEPT!!! 
If u accidentally (hit other buttons by accident) ! 

So then when  u push continue ,the targets are still flying where u left off , 
versus a timer to countdown where u were , 
this makes you end up missing targets if you arnt fast enough or if you headset  is still adjusting back to the game which can can be a bummer  🧐😭
~~~~~~~~~
Back to the positives  ! 🥰🥳

The scoreboard makes it fun for me but I can see why it could also be discouraging to many users and could be nice to be able to disable it . I use it to keep my competitive mind going hahah 

The fact that there is no subscription is amazing ! I think once things are tweaked I would say even 35 bucks would be with this game if no subscription is introduced but at the time being ,with not much difference in the trainers “script “talking and variety of songs ,and targets/ body accuracy on beats I could see people new to vr workouts getting bored easily if this was subscription based solely . But it isn’t so def give this game a go ! 🥊

I thought I loved supernatural and I do for it’s daily new adds and the music but if your looking to get ur heart beating and body pushed in a more realistic feeling workout this is amazing ! 🖤😝"
873,Swoop,"May 21, 2022 at 9:13 PM",4,Great!,This is a really fun workout game that keeps me coming back. I am glad there is no subscription fee and they are planning to add more workouts over the year and have already released one update. I cannot give this 5 stars but really want to die to the lack of music tracks. I like what they have but considering so many workouts just re-use the same tracks over and over it gets very repetitive. Hope new updates bring new tracks with them to bump this up to a 5.

I've only had the chance to do the tutorial and a basic boxing working, but so far it's a fairly solid experience. This is not a janky App Lab fitness game. So that's the fourth star.

There are a few things that could use improvement though, and since the developers say they're reading all of the reviews, I'm writing this to add weight to the comments made by other reviewers.

1. Please make the leaderboard optional. Not everybody wants a social experience while exercising, and having that giant board floating just off to the side of the arena is *really* distracting when you're trying to focus on targets, especially as the board is updating dynamically in real time. This might be less true for neurotypical folk, but I have ADHD and I find it quite stressful trying to keep my focus on the targets with the leaderboard there. If you change nothing else, please please address this issue. 

2. I agree with others who find the sky fist and hammer fist motions unnatural and un-enjoyable. I actually worry that I might injure myself doing some of them, due to over-extension. An option to filter these out would be great - maybe just turn them into jabs and crosses or something simple, for those who select the filter? Or at the very least, move away from these moves in future workouts  – or offer workouts without them?

3. Also agree that the height calibration seems slightly off – with my height set correctly the targets all felt a bit too high. I've gone in and edited my profile to make myself an inch shorter, but I didn't have time to do another workout to test the change. Will update this review once I have.

Overall, this seems like it's going to be a pretty solid contribution to the VR fitness genre. Just needs a few tweaks!"
878,Chris,"May 31, 2022 at 11:08 AM",5,Simply the best,I absolutley love this app. I find myself looking forward to my 'fitness' sessions every day... Sometimes twice or more a day.
879,Max0730,"May 20, 2022 at 8:55 PM",5,Excellent workout,Loved the variety of workouts.  The leaderboards push you just a little bit harder.  Got a very good sweat doing these.  Highly recommended if you're looking for a serious workout.
880,Jules,"May 7, 2022 at 9:33 PM",5,The best!!,"I am loving this workout!! I feel like I am getting so much exercise and there are so many different ones to choose from! I love that I don't have to have a subscription. 5 starts, wish I could give it 6, it makes me sweat which is hard to do!"
881,Boogie,"Apr 25, 2022 at 7:43 AM",5,Awesome workouts!!,"Body Combat and VR is a workout for those who are serious about staying happy and healthy! Congratulations on making your first move towards this goal. 👏 Love the new updates! Keep em burning Body Combat! Buy this NOW, there's nothing else like it on the platform right now. Hands down the best workout on the quest 2!"
882,Gwen Hembrock,"Mar 27, 2022 at 7:15 AM",5,It's a fitness winner!,"BodyCombat is an entry into the fitness app genre that brings its own unique Les Mills flavor and some new moves.  If you’ve ever done a gym Bodycombat workout, you will see the similarities.  The intensity is there, although because of the nature of VR, there aren't the kicks and other legwork.  The VR version does do a good job of making up for this by engaging the lower body via dodging, squats, and a knee slam.

The trainers are recognizable Les Mills trainers with big in-your-face personalities.  They give some valuable advice and encouragement during the workouts.  You are either going to like them or not, but the beauty of the app is you can turn them off if you've had enough. 

Bodycombat also has a fun multiplayer element, where you can see some avatars at the beginning of a workout and then a leaderboard that tracks your performance against others who have completed the workout in the past.  If you are competitive, this could help give you the impetus to work just that little bit harder.  If it's not your thing, then you can turn this multiplayer element off!

The setting and the moves are immersive.  You'll be doing forward jabs, uppercuts, cross hooks, hammer moves, dodges and ducks, and a novel grab and knee slam move that engages your lower body.  There are a good range of intensity levels and workout durations.  I've yet to complete all of the roughly 30 workouts.  They have high replay value simply because they are good workouts with varied combinations of movements. 

If I could ding the app a quarter star on anything, it would be having the game not fully recognize my forward jabs, but I'm working on it and the devs seem to be actively looking at any user issues that come up.  I still get a good workout and I'll be using Bodycombat in regular rotation in my workout collection!"
883,Marz,"Apr 30, 2022 at 9:31 PM",5,Excellent.,"I purchased this because of the  "" No subscription "".
Excellent workout and fun to do.
Coaches in the ear can be a bit much but that can be muted out .
The only fault I could say is it would be better if you could pick your own music .
Otherwise a great exercise app."
884,Steph,Jun 8 at 2:18 AM,5,Must have for keeping fit,"Really great game to keep fit very good exercises, love the instructors!"
885,Mark Unread,"Feb 9, 2022 at 4:45 AM",5,This. is. big.,"Bought this four days ago and I've done one to three low-intensity workouts each day. I wished that this is what would happen, that this is how cool the experience would be, but I never thought it would. I do not love exercising, and I would never consider an exercise regimen like this (no offense, LesMills) if it were just some video series.

But I am hooked on this app, even though it keeps me sore day after day. It's crazy fun and it really is full-body, so it hits you where free weights and floor exercises don't.

Apparently fitness is going to be the first big revolution brought about by VR!"
886,Naz,"Apr 23, 2022 at 11:29 PM",5,Awesome,"Seriously - this fitness app does not get enough hype on the web, this fitness game is sooo good.

Doing 2 x 20 minutes per day and seeing results - wife is also using it every morning for 20 minutes and is seeing results.

Previously to this I was using beat saber for fitness cardio after a non vr workout which I thought was good until I got Les Mills -

Its a great workout, love the instructors during the workout, environments and music.  I almost did not purchase due to the review that this may become a subscription.  I would like to see it have add on workouts for a reasonable price like Beat Saber add on song packs.  I have missed Les Mills classes these past two years so I love having the ability to do Body Combat at home. Also,ove the new workouts that were just added."
890,Dan,"Mar 19, 2022 at 12:03 AM",5,Good but,"Ok so downloaded this software today . I am a fan of a certain other boxing workout in xr I mean vr . But I wanted a change so figured I'd get this . Firstly the level of engagement is excellent you really feel like you have a pt with you . The move range is varied which is good . That whole rocket knee thing is a great stress breaker . It will give you a good workout no doubt about it . Now let's talk about the elephant in the room or the target in the gym . Some targets show as a miss even when I put my fist through it   . It's very annoying and I can't figure out why . Additionally whilst in the class I feel short . I haven't had that sensation on any other workout in vr . My height is set accurately . Overall this is a very good kickoff but does feel like it's one or two updates away from where it should be . Let's see where we go from here
Update : Since my initial review my connection rate on punches has got a lot better.  So either my technique has got better or the devs have tweaked it.  I've now tried classes at every level and I have to say these classes are really good . The instructors jokes not so great but the classes are really good . So now a couple of spoilt ungrateful consumer requests.  1) can we do group classes with friends 2) the stats boxes are ok but what is the evolution stat and why does it not have any data   3 ) more classes please . 4) I've read that ultimately this would be a subscription app.  If this is the case please keep the subscription cost competitive and the updates regular . 
18th March 2021 : ok after weeks of using this app I'm happy to say this is the best fitness app in vr . Why ? Simple when I skip a day I really miss doing . That's not the case with any other fitness app. Les Mills is worth every penny . Now group classes pplllleeaasseee"

Other than that small issue I’d say this is the best boxing/cardio app on quest atm, also needing no subscription was the final selling point for me."

896,Dogman,"Mar 6, 2022 at 3:55 AM",5,Supernatural subscriber impressed,"Been an annual Supernatural subscriber for around nine months.  It is, by far, the best fitness app I have, I own pretty much every fitness app for the Quest.

It may still be the best, but now it has very serious competition.  LMBC works me in different ways than SN.  It is less cardio focused and more power focused than SN  The trainer input is outstanding and almost completely focused on form and power.  The workouts are between 5 and 20 minutes long and all 10 (out of maybe 30) I have done so far have been exhausting.  The high intensity ones are no joke.

If you are serious about VR fitness but are subscription averse, this app is the best.  It may go subscription but the devs say you get to keep the workouts purchased without subscribing.

I am now mixing LMBC into my daily routine, along with SN.  I used to  say I would only subscribe to one fitness app.  If LMBC goes subscription, I will have to amend that.  LMBC is that good."
897,Jose,"Apr 21, 2022 at 12:32 AM",5,Excellent Fitness App!,"Today I finally decided to give this app a try and boy am I glad I did. I workout on a regular basis but have been wanting to complement those strength focused workouts with some VR cardio workouts so have been trying out the popular ones for the Q2 and LM Bodycombat had been on my list to try but had been reluctant to buy it as I was worried about the feedback they said the trainers talk the ENTIRE time and can get annoying. I really didn’t want to sign up for one of the fitness apps with memberships (although I was prepared to if I did not like LMBC today) since this is not going to be my primary or daily workout program so not something that i would use daily. After using LMBC today I was blown away by how much of a better workout I got vs FitXR. It really did feel more like a real workout but with the fun factor and immersion that VR brings. The instructors didn’t bother me as much as I worried and the “social/leaderboard” component helped make me push harder. All in all, it was awesome! I hope this app continues to improve and add more content and DLC instead of going exclusively with a membership. A couple of feedback/ requests I would add… First, create “programs/routines” that automatically group a few of the individual workouts into a routine and Second, add a way to indicate that when we’ve already done a particular workout so we can keep track of which ones we’ve already done. Oh and 1 more… add metric units (feet/inches and pounds) for those of us in the US!"

903,Sebastiaan Jolie,"Apr 18, 2022 at 1:58 AM",5,The best fitness app to date!,"Please keep on expanding what you’re doing so well already: most of the music is good, voice-overs hit the right note, controller movements are registered correctly and in time (!!! So important), the intensity is as challenging as I need. I cant wait to see different surroundings and new classes appear as you will blow up in cash and development as soon as people try this game and know how natural and good it feels to lose stress, stay disciplined and fit, even to push yourself to your limits. APRIL 2022 and THIS is the BEST fitness experience on Meta Quest 2. I have to add that Supernatural isn’t available in my country for comparison, and I wish Meta would wield some of its’ power to make the world a little bit more equal when it comes to opportunities to fitness on VR. 🤭"

Please don't do subscription like all the other vr apps. It's not a model that works for me. I don't use them enough to justify paying monthly. I am prepared to pay for quality dlc. I'm sure the reputation you get from keeping it as a one of payment will put you to of the charts."

909,BJ,"Apr 16, 2022 at 9:05 PM",5,Most intense workout game yet,"Amazing game.  I'm gassed in the least amount of time of any game.  Every negative comment so far is a feature of the game.  
-""Some of the moves feel unnatural"" Yes, if you look at this as a boxing trainer. Its a fitness game.  They're trying to give you a balanced workout.
-""You have to accurately snap your strikes to get the most points.""  Can be difficult if your timing is off, and hard on your elbows if you're overextending.  But don't worry about it or overextend, you don't need max points.  Its about how hard you work.  You could miss every target, and still feel like you just sprinted to the top of an apartment building.
I hope it doesn't go subscription, that you can buy addons instead.  But if it does, there's enough material to make it worth the price as it is now.
Overall, it is the best VR fitness game... if you're looking for the most intense workout, in the shortest amount of time."
910,Jorganizer,"Apr 16, 2022 at 11:01 AM",5,Best fitness app I've found!,"The graphics, music and gameplay are so smooth. Challenging, yet encouraging. I keep coming back for more. 

Also REALLY happy to see new free content added! The April update was a nice surprise! 

Wish I could see the name of the tune and exercise during play so I could know how to find it again next time. Additionally it'd be nice to see a timeline of which workouts you did and when. Would make it possible to establish better habits."
911,Laurel,"May 16, 2022 at 1:40 AM",5,Vr exercise is a game changer,"I have written two reviews in the past stating my frustration of the online connection-this is a risk of an early adopter.  
Now however I have come to absolutely love this exercise program.  This is a complete game changer in my life where I can get 10 minutes strenuous cardio instantly-no set up, no gym visit just instant-I want to exercise and now I am.  
Squatting for an extended time, hitting the targets while listening to a coach encourage me is surreal.   I know without vr I would be disciplining my mind to stay on task.  
My life demands too much discipline it’s great to achieve my goals without draining my reserve.
Also the coach tells me I’m a winner-I find myself muttering this as I hit,  it’s a little cheesy and in public I would be embarrassed yet in my own space I can adapt this positive drill.  I finish a session sweating and recharged.   I feel wealthy to own this powerful tool.  I highly recommend this."
912,Baby Bear,"May 8, 2022 at 5:23 AM",5,Yes finally,I love this workout and it really helps me work out every day. I can choose 4 minutes or 30 - whatever I have time for an I am sure to work up a sweat!  Love it. Just need me squats. 😉
913,Elton,Jun 10 at 3:02 PM,5,Highly recommended!,"Firstly, I have to say this is very very well done. I have a Supernatural membership, but I'm in to fitness apps so I gave this a try. This gives SN a good run for their money, and boxing here is definitely better than the boxing there! SN has way more content, but Les Mills is VERY well put together. The coaches coach to the beat of the music, and this interface is simple, just choose low medium or high intensity. I kinda like that simplicity! And I have used Les Mills Dance with Nina and I recognize the Aussie girl! Good to see a familiar face.

There's been reviews asking developers not to change to subscription. While everyone likes to save money, including me, I do understand if they switched to membership. If it's a good product, do it. It's good for business as longs as it's reasonable. ""PRICE IS WHAT YOU PAY, VALUE IS WHAT YOU GET"", says Warren Buffet. 100% agree 😁."

915,Lee,"May 5, 2022 at 2:57 PM",4,Best workout app,"I love it. Thankfully they don’t have the audacity to try to make you buy it again every month, and it’s exactly the kind of work out I want. This is now my #1 VR fitness app.

My only quibble is the scoring. It doesn’t seem to take into account power or form; it seems like it’s entirely based on touching precisely the right location at precisely the right time from precisely the right angle. Especially with uppercuts… I know how to throw an uppercut, but I haven’t yet figured out exactly what the game wants me to do. It seems like if you want to get the maximum score, it’s easier if you play it as a rhythm action game, throwing slow weaker strikes. Or focus on power and form and just not care about the score, but that can be discouraging.

What I really want is real VR martial arts training, but unfortunately such a thing doesn’t exist yet. Still one of the best fitness VR apps I’ve tried yet though."

Will be great to explore more of the app. Would be great to eventually bring in more body movements to create greater variety, but I doubt I will get bored for a good while. The coaches are encouraging and the competitive element helps me to push a bit harder. Now one of my favourite apps!"

925,David HK,"May 23, 2022 at 12:28 PM",4,Amazing!,"I wouldn't compare this to Supernatural because that serves it's own purpose, but before using LM Body Combat, my Speed scores kept going down, but when learning from this app on how to punch with power, I go through the Supernatural workouts like a hot knife through butter. All of my speed scores are in the high 90s. As said by  others, I hope that you don't convert to a subscription model. If you need to make more money I will be more than happy to buy any extra packs that you may offer.
*******UPDATE********** Oh by the way I know some y'all cheating your way up the leaderboards. I'll be on top at least 50-100k points head of the next guy, through almost the entire workout, and out of nowhere literally 30sec to 1 min before it ends, a bunch of people pass me. Either they are taking it easy throughout the entire workout until the last couple of minutes then go buck wild where you can rake in the most points or or you pause and take really long breaks to save your energy and push as hard as you can at the end. It defeats the whole purpose! Such B.S! I care more about the workout and getting fit so I'm not stooping to that level just to see my name at the top. Taking away a star until they fix that hole. If you pause for more that a minute or two you should have to start over again."
926,Kashban,"Apr 12, 2022 at 4:34 PM",5,A blast even for seasoned Martial Artist,"I am a hobby Kickboxer and this App is exactly what I was looking for to weather through Corona times. From half an hour to an hour+ a few times the week and I am keeping my fitness and technique on point. 

The courses are very differentiated, with focus on lower body, core, upper body or full body, and every one of them is guided by the very motivating trainers in the game. An additional ""live"" ranking with seemingly competetive players adds to the motivation factor to come out on top, though this clearly is not live (how would the Pause function work then?). Length varies between 5 and 25 minutes and 25 minutes on the highest intensity will make you sweat, promised!

Some hits are not part of kickboxing like backhand fists to the sides or up, or hammerfists down, but I quickly got the drift... they are great for core work. Being forced to slide left, right or squat beneath obstacles greatly adds to the workout. Of course knees are only tracked by the hand movement and you can just keep your foot down, but that'll diminish your training effect, so always perform the moves like your legs would be tracked too. 

One thing that Les Milles Body combat is lacking is proper footwork, as this is - like many rythm fitness games - a mostly standing experience. If you want to have more movement around your play space, also get Thrill of the Fight. 

The music in LM BC is good for a sports game and keeps me flowing with the moves and hits. 

If you are looking for a fitness game focusing on martial arts, look no further. LesMilles Body Combat is a must-have. It's also one charge only, no subscription model (so far), and they add courses regularely. 

I didn't come across severe bugs, the menu works fine for me and the performance only tanks if I try to increase texture size by Sidequest tooling. 

TL;DR: This is very much worth it's full price and if you can get it at a special price, it's a bargain. See you in the Gym!"
927,Crunchby,"Apr 12, 2022 at 8:51 PM",5,Great fitness app,"I'm a  long time ..20+ years, Les Mills user. First at the gym, then Les Mills on demand.  This is a great augment to on-demand. Love and recognized the instructors.  Wowza, I was sweating, and not just on my silicone face piece.  Clever coding to get legs involved. This is WAY better than that boxing app.    FYI, the people you are ""competing"" against are not real.  I really hated that at first, felt myself getting distracted by the leaderboard.  When I read they were fake I could just relax and do the routine."
928,Elpi35,"May 5, 2022 at 9:50 AM",2,Why being forced to competition ?,"This app could easily be the best if we were not FORCED to be in a contest. While doing your workout, you have a panel to show you your place against contestants : couldn't this be optional ? Is it that hard to code a ""enable/disable"" button ?

Same for the voices. 
Sorry but i can't hear anymore fake enthusiasm yelling at my ears ; Fake because ok, we all know these are voice records, but earing ""your name is going UP !"" while you are just downgraded has a name : it's a lie. 
An it is even more deceptive when you are in lack of self-confidence, and you understand it as ""you should have been higher"". I'm french, we don't do class actions here, but where the developpers are, it could happen. 

[ Ideas for developpers ] 
- enable/disable scores against contestants
- enable/disable voices

932,toddYoungONLINE,"May 1, 2022 at 2:18 AM",4,Really like this...,"This is one of the better workouts in an app, it feels more comprehensive than the others...

It's the only one that tries to include legs beyond just squats and has more punching movements...as of when i write this at least...

I do prefer Supernaturals wide range of music and the trainers are just a bit more motivating, but this is still an awesome workout...

i would like to have the option to hide the score...the gamificatoon helps, but i dont really care about it...

the option for live classes across all of these titles could be interesting...being able to hear, talk, and motivate each other through the workout..."
933,Gianni Di Lipsia,"May 1, 2022 at 9:26 PM",4,"Great, but avoid jumping","Last week I was enjoying my workout so much, that I jumped to hit the skypunches. But afterwards my height was ""corrected"" automatically (body height + jump), so I didn't have to duck down, when a barrier appeared on the top, for example. Maybe the game could ask in those cases, if the player wants to autoadjust the height or the creators add autoadjustment to the settings, so you can turn it off, if you like to jump ;)"
934,StackOverflow,"Feb 17, 2022 at 3:29 PM",5,From 3 to 5 stars!,"Update Feb 17 2022: 5 stars:
Thanks for listening to the feedback developers, my review went up 2 stars, it’s 5 now! The introduction of the metric system and the knee kicks are much easier to understand now! Also did the tutorial again, you guys nailed it! I can really recommend this workout app, love it every day. For future updates it would be nice that you can buy some additional workouts, so you guys will have another income without having to introduce subscriptions. Thanks for creating this nice VR workout app! 

Update Feb 13 2022: 4 stars:
I like the fitness program more and more. Even start to understand how to perform the knee kick. Waiting for the update to use the metric values. Also hope that you can manually start the tutorial again. If that’s fixed I give it definitely 5 stars!


Original review Feb. 9 2022: 3 stars:
First the onboarding: We live a the metric   part of the world, no clue with my Oculus on what kg to lbs is and meter/centimeter to ft/inch. Then the onboarding. Really looks nice and the first workout i had a really good score and liked it! The next workout the knee thingy was introduced, but have no clue how to do it right. I see no option to start the tutorial again, so the next workout i ended last, because of the knee thing. Could you please make the option available to start the tutorial again and make it clearer how the knee thing works. Thanks! If those issues are fixed I probably will give it a much higher score!"
935,Dr. Mic,"Apr 10, 2022 at 8:40 AM",5,Best FItness Experience on Quest so far,"It is absolutely motivating, well structured, with good music. And instructors give constant feedback on correct posture and actions. Love it!

Two things I would love to see in the future
1. Seeing the instructors doing the exercise together with me so I am 100% sure how to execute each element - like in a real course
2. Taking the building away to train „outside“. We are all sitting so much inside dull rooms - And the building here already is at least partially open - but please let me also train outside in nature."
936,Michelle Ocasio,"Mar 2, 2022 at 6:28 PM",5,Awesome experience,"I'm writing this review from the point of view of someone who needs to lose over 100lbs. I'm hoping it'll grab my attention as much as FitXR, Supernatural and Liteboxer. 

Before purchasing this game I had a few questions that would help me decide if I would keep it:

Can I turn off squats? No, and my knees will rebel against me in the morning I'm sure. My thigh muscles are burning but it's a good burn!

I know I'm a poor player, will it demotivate me?
No, it was quite motivating and both the coaches and the leader board were encouraging. The music was pretty good, combination of Hip Hop and Rock. With FitXR I am constantly at the bottom of the leaderboard, and on this game I was #2. I'm a little suspicious of that.

Can I play against people I know? No, and this is a deal-breaker for me because it'll help keep me accountable. Before the class starts, while the coach is giving his or her pep talk, there are about 6 avatars doing what I can only describe as funky dance moves but they were not the in the actual class. 

Is the beginning level too hard, and are there several beginning sessions from which to choose? No, the beginning class was not too hard but there are only four of them. For the medium intensity there are about nine classes and I believe there were 13 classes for the high intensity.

Is there diversity in the trainers? No. 

Can I play on the original Oculus Quest (1)? No, and this was a big bummer for me. I use the Oculus Quest 1 for sweaty games like Supernatural, Beat Saber and FitXR, and I only use my Quest 2 for travel experiences and movies. There was a message that popped up when I clicked to buy it, warning me that it would not be compatible with the Oculus Quest 1.

Can I play multiple workouts consecutively like a play list? No. The workouts for my level were less than 10 minutes long, and I cannot connect them together like a playlist."
937,BlueFrog,"May 3, 2022 at 8:05 PM",2,Pretty good training but …,I actually really love most of this game but there’s one thing that ruins it for me and that is this knee-lifting exercise. That is really not working for me. I can hit the target maybe 1 out of 10 times. It ruins my motivation and it ruins my points. This knee exercise is the reason why I sometimes don’t want to play it. ￼
938,Doug-Bot,"Apr 9, 2022 at 9:03 PM",5,Great Workout App,"I've had Les Mills Bodycombat for a month now and it's my favorite Quest app and I use it almost every day for a good workout.  The workout environments and graphics are awesome and the fitness coaches, Dan and Rachael, provide helpful guidance as well as frequent motivation.  Best part of the app- no subscription needed."
939,Constantin,Jun 1 at 10:18 PM,5,Kostiok,Perfect for all levels of training
940,CoolNinja,"Feb 9, 2022 at 4:18 AM",1,Potential but a huge no go for me,"Not long after I purchase I end up finding out they are going with monthly fee. Needs to say that in the description!!
 All it says is, more to come. If you keep paying that is. Seriously annoying. To many are switching to pay every month to get new content. Dare to quit paying and you lose everything except what it originally came with. That is pointless as these are all about new exercises to keep you motivated. Out of the 30 each person will end up only sticking with a few they like. Dwindling down the value quickly. Unless of course you keep paying every month. Look what happened to the reviews after fit suddenly switched to monthly pay wall. 
  What I like so much about beat saber strategy is if they come out with a music pack I do not like as I review first on YouTube , I can just not buy it. I still have access to everything else. That’s value. 
 Possibly give a few workouts to those who cannot pay every month? Another option is if you do pay for a month , you get even more workouts to keep as opposed to those that do not get the monthly subscription? Something that gives everyone something. To show and say “we got you”.

Negatives : 1 - hit detection. 2 - I also have to punch to hard to get the bigger rings. If you are punching and not hitting anything it is not good to keep extending the arm to the point you snap your elbow. This has me punching way to hard to get the large rings from a hit. 3 - the sound for hits is very weak. I want to hear something breaking with force. Possibly even glass shattering. Possibly a unique great sound for hitting lengthy combos? Knee strikes with there own unique cool sound 4 - these knee strikes are just plain crazy. You have to be super precise. Within 1/1000 of a second. I just did a routine with 3 in a row very fast knee strikes. Was way to fast , not allowing proper strikes or even a remote chance of hitting them.

Positives : I really like the variety of movements. With double punches, side punches, straight up punches, down punches, fist slams. Knee strikes.  Upper cuts. You name it. If these are synced right to the music you can create some incredibly fun combos. So if I buy this again in the future I will check on this part especially. 

Suggestions : 1 I saw my gloves light up in a great moving light pattern. Was rather cool. Maybe through achievements or from leveling up a way to earn really cool workout gloves to use during the workouts. Would be cool and motivating to see the other people avatar show up like they do and I see them wearing these awesome gloves. Motivate me to workout to earn them as well. I do not see a way to modify my gloves. I am right hand dominant and it is easier for me to have darker colors on my right hand . A way to switch them? Example if there where flaming gloves. One would be red flame the other glove yellow flame. What about different block effects? If I’m wearing flame gloves and I hit for a long combo the blocks coming at me could start flaming? All these for incredible motivation. Ice gloves . Blocks coming at you could show a freeze effect after getting a good combo. 

 Lots of potential, but for now will return

Forgot another positive. Thank you for using recordings of actual people and not avatars. That one thing seriously annoys me about the fit exercise game. More trainers also would be great"
941,Megan,"Apr 10, 2022 at 11:05 PM",5,Best game ever,I really love this game I get a good sweat every time and I’m sore right after. Wonderful game and no monthly subscription like the others which is what I really wanted because what if I can’t get on it everyday with this game I don’t have to be worried about wasting money 😊😊
942,Brian,"Apr 30, 2022 at 8:54 AM",3,Ok app,"I use this app almost everyday,
It complements my needs for variation in my workout as I use supernatural primarily.This app doesn’t have a paid subscription of which you can see, as it lacks content. The instructor voices get increasingly annoying as I’ve heard them 100 times. I usually just turn the sound all the way down. I like the competitive aspect but I’m very disappointed in lack of “forgiveness” when it comes to performing knee movements, if you don’t hit it exactly right it, You will miss it and this ruins my whole combo and thus I lack interest in the workout. I’ve taken the tutorials and just can’t seem hit them. For the cost it’s a buy but I can see myself exploring different options if some were presented."
943,Eric,"Feb 7, 2022 at 9:57 PM",5,Love It!,"NO Subscription required = Awesome

I've wanted to get a few fitness games now, but I refuse to pay a Subscription every month.   So when  I saw this was Subscription free, I was extremely happy!

I do BodyCombat at my local gym and I didn't think it world be possible to replicate.  They did a great job and I'm having a blast.  

As I move up into the harder workouts, I find that the 6 other scores being shown is a HUGE motivator.   I may be a bit competitive,  because if I'm in 2nd or 3rd place,  I really pick up the pace in the final 5 minutes to try and get 1st place.

Great job Les Mills and Place., I've had a blast over the last few days!"
944,Don,"May 8, 2022 at 6:27 AM",4,Great subscription-free workout,"This app is a great consistent full body workout. I even convinced 2 other people to pay for it & start using it. After the first time I used it, my entire body was sore. I can easily work up a great sweat in just several minutes. That said, it’s not without flaws. Occasionally, it has issues picking up certain movements consistently, like the pull down (knees). Otherwise, it’s still a great workout. I’m glad that it’s subscription free and I hope it stays that way!"
945,Thomas,"Apr 6, 2022 at 7:52 AM",5,Much better than expected,"Saw the reviews and praise for a little while but didn't pay it much mind. I have to say I definitely hate that I didn't get this much sooner.

If you are debating picking this up, I'd definitely grab it. I am a monthly supernatural subscriber and what I would say is supernatural has more of a speed and agility workout where as I feel Les Mills is more of a power and conditioning workout.

I still exercise with both but Les Mills has definitely been my go to as of late.

Love this app hopefully more updates continue to come on the future"
946,Captain Howdy,"Apr 6, 2022 at 10:39 AM",5,Wow,Absolutely love this app!

954,Jdizzle,"Apr 3, 2022 at 9:44 PM",5,Great workout!,"I work out regularly through the week. This app had me sweating and breathing heavily. Which is more cardio based but hits on several moments which get the blood flow moving and muscles you may not use everyday. Make sure you have plenty of space, a good fan and a towel nearby. The fogging of the VR was the worst without a fan. Definitely worth the $30"
955,Fran Florcan,"Feb 3, 2022 at 8:19 PM",5,I was waiting for this game!!,I was waiting for this!!!  I love LES MILLS and this app lives up to expectations about it and without a subscription.  Missing translation into other languages and some more content that I expect in future updates.
956,Noble,"Apr 3, 2022 at 2:51 AM",5,Good workout,"It's good, but anyone in moderately decent shape will want to do a high intensity workout. With only 10 of these,  I can see that I won't want to use the app for long. I would actually prefer a subscription model with daily workouts, for the right price (no need for ""premium"" music). I think subscriptions work better for these types of apps because  there is a need for new workouts to keep things interesting."
957,Kellie Hunter,"Apr 4, 2022 at 4:57 PM",5,Love it! So fun!,"I've tried other fitness games on the Oculus, and Beat Saber has been the only enjoyable one until this. Definitely gets me sweating and I enjoy martial arts so it's just fun! Playing online is the most motivating because you see your name on the score board and it moves up and down amongst the other people playing so it makes you wanna push harder to get your name up top. I am super sore and I just want to keep playing. Now I dont feel annoyed at cardio because this is just fun! Working out is so much more fun when it's a game. This game and Beat Saber are by far the best exercise games on the Oculus. I was checking out the 1 star reviews and it sounds like a lot of those people either did experience glitches in the game that must be fixed because I havent had any issues, or else they are just very uncoordinated and dont know how to hit moving targets lol."
958,blazingsilverflame,"Apr 2, 2022 at 6:27 PM",5,"Wanna sweat?!? Buy this, Do Les Mills.","As said many times before.. The best part is zero subscription fees!!! I get that that there could be add ons, but please don't take away the programs already in the game.  

Post Covid I have been trying to get my sons to exercise more and we've tried versions from Wii fit/X box Kinect/youtube/play station but none have them have made them sweat like Les Mills.  

*The one thing that would make this game over the top would be to go against friends live!  I like that you are facing other randoms but how awesome would it be to able to jump on with 4 friends and be able to compete against each other in real time?!!!  Even without this feature the game is 5* but imagine with it...wow!

Second minor ask, although I enjoy the narrative for now,  at some point I  could see myself looking for the mute option.  Hopefully there could be a feature to mute the narration. I mean as a work around, I could turn off the sound completely but that would take away from the tempo. I could see that if I've gone through the same program repeatedly I may just want to mute just narrative.   

3rd even more minor ask, added backgrpunds would be nice, anyone up for beach side or country wilderness workout? You're looking more at targets and not too focussed on the background but would be an welcomed upgrade.

All and all if you are looking for a good sweat, buy this game and get shredded. You can even add some ankle/wrist weights to take it to the next level!!!  Les Mills you have made a lifetime customer.  Although I may not have been familiar with your branding ... I am now and I'm definitely going to look for your other products!  

Another satisfied customer!"

960,ProllyAMeme,"Feb 4, 2022 at 7:42 AM",4,Great workout hit detection a lil off,"Just ran the tutorial and two of the under 10 minutes beginner workouts. Its a great workout even if some of the hammer fist and ""sky fist"" makes the experienced fighter in me wanna rip my hair out. The only real gripe I have is that there was a couple of times that the workout didn't detect a hit. Other apps like supernatural I don't have the issue. But for some reason my fist would just seem to go through a target. 

On the workout side its not a big deal. But you put up scores and the competitive side of me gets sad that I'm losing points that I shouldn't.  But then again competitive me is kinda a douche so f him.

Other than that great app"
961,Marie-Jo,"Apr 27, 2022 at 2:52 AM",5,Super!!!,Absolutely love it. Easy to learn and gives exactly the kind of exercises I need. Everyone should buy the application.  Hope it won’t ask me to pay per month like others.
962,DasBoeseBlub,"Mar 11, 2022 at 9:35 PM",4,Good with a little but,I really loved the workouts at first. Most of them consist of 5 Minute snippets that get combined in different orders for different workouts. I work out every day and the intense 20 minute + workouts are really challenging if you go for big scores. What  really annoys me is the trash talk while working out. The parts where they tell you what comes next are helpful but this nonsense in between might make sense when you have a real life session but in this App it gets super repeterive and you just wanna make it stop. For the future it would wish for a option to just deavtivate the trash talk.

Downside the teachers do say the same repetitive banter. But on a plus you can push yourself it’s as good as a real class. But without all the costs. 
I love it WARNING it’s addictive in 2 weeks I’ve dropped in weight and feel like I’ve done a real work out. See you there. 
Remember you can add on as many packages suck as two 25 min work outs and a 10-15 that means your body carries on burning calories after you stop start small im very impressed. I take my Oculus all over the world and do it in my hotel room."
965,Rebel Sab,"Apr 24, 2022 at 6:33 PM",3,Could be so much better!,"Can definitely get a good sweat! Sessions start too slow. It would be good to have few sessions to learn moves then all other sessions to get to it straight away.
During the session selection, we can see which body parts are used. It would help to have filter  on the top screen without having to check each class (like Fit RX)
The worst parts are the scripts to motivate the participants - maybe 6-7 different which become very annoying to hear after a few classes. Ex: super héros costume? Bread? Gosh!! Which we could just hear the music and cut off trainer’s voices!"

971,Oculingis,"Apr 20, 2022 at 5:20 AM",4,Seeing Similarities,"Very similar to Supernatural and fitXR both of which I've tried, I would like to see some creativity or trying something new with these apps as they do get quite stale after only a few workouts. Throw in some powerups or include literally anything else outside of punches and squats. 

My biggest negatives:  it doesn't track what workouts you've done and since they are all almost identical, I honestly can't tell what I've done and what I haven't. Second, the music is real bad. Let us import our own or use our own from Spotify etc. 

Overall a good app and I find the hit registering far exceeds the last similar fitness app I tried. My final point is on membership which I think is a bad idea but I know is going to be implemented. Just don't do it. It turns into no updates at all for all your loyal fans who got this app off the ground for a single (and large) price of $35. If you must incl memberships please make updates for non membership people too!"

More fun than fitxr, I love how the repeating patterns come, adding more instead of more chaos like supernatural.  Where's me out as much as supernatural.  My hope, as I already have commenced quite a few friends to buy it, is they don't go to a monthly sub, and instead do dlc packages aimed at specific goals (killer leg workout, ultimate cardio training...)  Maybe add in dlc that has slight variations in gameplay, like hit is for fitxr or boxing for supernatural...  Great game though guys"

978,Critterden,"Feb 6, 2022 at 4:44 AM",5,Great workout,"This is a more complete body workout than supernatural or fit xr. It works the core and the legs better than any of the other fitness games. I see some complaining about the keaderboard being in the way but I like where it is. its off to my right side so I can see the movement on the board as I’m progressing through the workout. if people are that easily distracted by it off to the side, perhaps a concentration class is in order. I’m not trying to be mean but it’s definitely far enough off to the side that it’s not in the way. What is the point if you can’t see it until its over? One problem I have is not being able to hit the knee smashes. Every once in a while I get one, but for the most part I watch myself move down the leaderboard during the knee smashes. Any suggestions on that are welcome. Regardless, I’m still doing the motion and burning calories. I didnt have any trouble with hitting the rest of the targets as others have stated as long as I hit them with enough power. I’m 55 and in good shape, but my heart rate got up to 180 at times . One thing I would like to see is a previous score to see if I’m getting better.

Agree that having the trainers coaching me is awesome.  You have to just let this game do its thing and push you to the end...it's truly exhilarating.  Looking forward to playing more of the content.

When playing it seems that you are always looking at the same thing in the same ‘gym’ but with an environment change on the sides which you don’t really notice.  It’s more like a slight colour change. To see that the environment has changed substantially you have to look behind you.  What good is that?
It would be nice to have a change of environment that actually looks and feels like a change.
Here’s hoping for the next (first) update."
985,Pernille,"Apr 19, 2022 at 1:38 PM",5,Love it,"I actually got the oculus to try BC, because it looked to be a lot of fun.....and it is. I still do stuff from LMOD, but it's great to try something different, to keep up the spirit"
986,Mark,"Mar 26, 2022 at 9:16 PM",5,Awesome… but can I compete with myself,"Love it ( after the workout) . Listening to the instructors you use the right muscles and make it harder and a better workout .
I like the leaderboard and find it helps to focus my attention to try and get higher but sometimes after doing this  with 5 minutes to go I’m already 10,000 ahead and there’s no challenge .
Would it be possible to have my best score on the leaderboard so I’ve always got someone to compete with
Cheers keep up the good work"
987,Equalizer,"Mar 26, 2022 at 8:28 AM",5,Best Workout,I have always been looking for something to make me sweat and get a good pump! This is the best workout I’ve had. Never stopped sweating through every workout. Even the 5 minute ones have you sweating! Highly highly recommend this if you are looking for something that doesn’t require a membership this is for you!
988,BRF,"May 3, 2022 at 12:30 AM",5,Not Disappointed,It delivers as promised by inducing a pounding heart and beads of sweat.  Much preferred over a subscription model.
989,MickRx,"Apr 2, 2022 at 10:53 PM",5,Wow what a workout,"This app will get your HR up!!! Intensity levels are perfect, you will not be able to start at high intensity unless you’ve done kickboxing classes recently.

990,Biltongus,"Apr 14, 2022 at 2:40 PM",5,Highly recommended,Just a lot of fun whilst getting a proper workout. This is the only home workout I enjoy and can see myself still doing in a years time. The new set of workouts in the update are amazing fun. Love it.
991,PrettyBird,"Mar 29, 2022 at 12:34 AM",5,Love. Love. Love.,It’s my second day using this app. I hate working out but I’m in love with this. It get your cardio up quick if your in less than perfect shape. It works your muscles and help with emotional stress. Please do not ever make a paid subscription required. Thank you for making this!!!
992,Hiawathalee,"Apr 4, 2022 at 12:38 AM",5,Best App Yet,I wanted a workout app without a subscription and this one had great reviews. I was not disappointed! After a 20 minute workout my whole body is sore! I had so much fun that I wanted to keep going but my legs were like rubber. Definitely a must have!
993,Bobbie Jo Sands,"Feb 28, 2022 at 5:21 AM",5,Absolutely amazing,"I bought other fitness apps last week, along with this one. I am new to the VR society and I couldn't be more thrilled. I have been struggling at trying to lose weight these past few years. It was hard to stay motivated until last week. I told myself I want to try it 4 times a week for 20 minutes. Well as the time went on, I spent over 40 minutes on it because I was so inspired to keep pushing. The next day my muscles were sore, I didn't want to do anything but give it another go. I started working out again and 40 minutes passed again. You definitely get a work out in this session. I was sweating pretty good. It took a but to figure out the knee drives but after doing the tutorial a few times I mastered it. Practice makes perfect and they are inspiring to keep pushing forward! I can't wait to see the end result"
994,TahitiTea,"Feb 5, 2022 at 11:48 AM",4,Thanks for not being subscrition-based,"5 stars for not being subscription based.
But only 3 stars for user experience – why:
1. There is no menu to adjust basic things like lagging (like in Ragnarock or Beat Saber), speaker voice vs. music/beat, intensity of controller feedback etc.
2. I seem to have a lag problem – forward punches work great, but I miss 50% of side punches completely. This is highly frustrating because it has nothing to do with my timing. Since I have come first in the excercises I have tried so far, I am pretty sure others have the same issue or I (petite female) would not have such high scores.
3. The feedback you get, when hitting the targets is just too weak – another setting that I would like to be able to change in the settings that do not exist 😉 ."

997,Jesse,"Mar 21, 2022 at 9:19 AM",5,Amazing!!!!!,I have been doing this workout 3x a week for 4 weeks. The results are excellent. I can notice the fat reduction on my  body. Heart beat goes up during workouts. The workouts are scientific and very effective. You will be working out every part of you're body. Hands down the best fitness app. Lesmills not kidding you have changed my life. I have so much more confidence.
998,Chef Michael,"Mar 21, 2022 at 4:52 PM",5,Best VR workout hands down!,Did some online research and decided to go with LM BodyCombat. So far this app is kicking my butt and making me sweat in record time. I will definitely post my progress on social media. Having this workout in the comfort of my own home is great! And the “trainers” keep you going. I definitely recommend this. Especially because it’s affordable. Only a onetime charge and it’s yours. No monthly or yearly subscription needed.
999,Fel,"Mar 25, 2022 at 1:37 PM",5,Great fitness app,"Great fitness app, if u love kickboxing or body combat classes this can actually replace them.. At least for now (covid period hard to book classes in gym in Singapore ). A 20mins session can made u really sweat (high intensity and put full effort/power) . I actually brought the oculus because I saw the les Mill vr advertisement as well as some YouTube search review,"
1000,Rob Z,"Apr 18, 2022 at 6:34 PM",5,Fantastic work out app!,Love this app.  It makes you feel like you have a trainer motivating you while you work out.  The fact that this is a one time purchase makes it even better!
1001,Jeff,"Apr 13, 2022 at 7:31 AM",5,Good workout,"Just did a few of the shorter ones, don’t know why but the music and the rhythm makes you really wanna work out and punch everything lol. Perfect app for what I was looking for￼"
1002,Alex,"Apr 3, 2022 at 11:54 PM",5,Excellent Fitness Application !,"I could not justify paying a subscription of $19 per month, to me that's ridiculous.  That's like paying for gym membership. So, tried Les Mills and I love it. Keeps you motivated, great intensity levels and fun way to work out."
1003,Elle,"Apr 9, 2022 at 5:24 AM",4,Good Workout,"Good base but could use a bit more work. First, I don’t use it to get in shape. I use these kind of programs after the gym to work form and flow (shadow box). The good: trainers, choreography and that you can throw in knees. This really differentiates from Supernatural. What id like is the ability to turn off leaderboard/multiplayer aspect. It really bothers me. Instead of an escapist work out for me to focus on form, I’m glancing over at my ‘score’.  I do Muay Thai so the gaming aspect of it is just annoying. Music packs would be cool. A bit better tracking. Can’t see how to adjust things again and it feels off. I don’t want to have to reload the program. I’m sure this will hopefully get tweaked in time. For the moment I’ll still primarily use Supernatural as it’s a better form of escapism and I don’t use VR for social aspects but escape from it."
1004,Xariann,"Mar 19, 2022 at 5:13 PM",5,"High energy, motivating","While Les Mills is perhaps the new kid on the block that isn't really doing a lot of new things, the energy of the instructors and the way the workouts are built are probably amongst the best.

Instead of getting the random comment here and there, each workout has been fully voiced, meaning that what the instructors say applies to what you are doing at that moment. 

They also ""know"" if you haven't logged into Les Mills for a while or if you have been logging regularly, making pertinent comments.

Obviously, as it's all pre-recorded eventually you have heard it all before, but good motivation and high energy are very important and I find it makes a huge difference compared to other VR boxing games.

This is basically better than the cardio portion of Les Mills On Demand.

Definitely recommend this and if you haven't bought any boxing games before, this is the one I will recommend you buy first. It's fun, it's challenging."
1005,manders425,"Apr 14, 2022 at 11:50 PM",5,So fun!!,"It's so fun! by the time I'm done I'm a sweaty mess, definitely a fun way to workout. I love that it's a one time purchase. PLEASE don't make it a monthly subscription."

Would definitely recommend"
1011,Dogz,"Mar 18, 2022 at 1:18 PM",5,"Don’t think about it, do it.","So, first ever review I have done. I have been lazy, I have lockdown belly, been off work with long term sickness and generally been in a low place. I have been trying to get motivated to do something in order to get my fitness a little better. Problem is, I get bored easily and find it very hard to get and stay motivated. Fast forward a few weeks, I have return to work date and want to start getting into shape. I have been looking at many apps and less mills caught my eye, that and the overwhelmingly positive reviews and non subscription. I took the plunge and made the purchase. It’s day 2 and my body feels like it’s been hit by a bus but that’s a good thing! No pain no gain and I can tell you that I am already looking forward to tomorrow’s workout! It generally feels like a trainer is in the room with you, keeping you motivated and pushing you. Exactly what I needed. Don’t doubt it, do it. It’s been a long time since I have felt good about anything and between this and Tripp, I am in a much better place mentally and hopefully soon, a lot fitter as well! 

I hear future updates and dlc we in the works which I can say already, I will be very interested in. The non subscription is a total blessing, especially with todays current climate and rising expenses. 

As a recommendation and certainly not a complaint, I would love it if when you switch on for a workout, it reminds you of your previous workout and the results achieved so I can try and beat the score. The knee striking defiantly takes practise but feels really effective when you have worked it out. The squats! Omg the squats have absolutely obliterated my legs and it feels great!! It really is a total body workout. Well done to the everyone involved in the making of this app and i wish it all the success it deserves. Now, let’s get fit!"
1012,Marc,"Feb 4, 2022 at 12:58 PM",3,Excellent Workout but with Problems,"I do not review apps, but I believe les Mills should be reviewed – both for the positive and negative. First, great job DEVS on actually making a good workout for a fixed price (lets hope it stays this way). The movements are good for everyone (from beginner to advanced) and you will sweat. The objects are not boring and the instructors do a decent job of motivation (although a little more sync with actual punching / hitting / missing, etc would be nice – now I can get a good job and miss almost everything). 

With that said, there are a few glaring problems. Many of these are expressed online and are what negates a better rating. Please DEVS read this (any many others online) and help make it amazing. 
1. The fact that there is NO way to go back and rewatch the tutorials is not only strange, it is also not healthy for new body combaters. You get 4 minutes of training and are supposed to know all the moves. You really need to add a training section where you can watch and redo the training videos.
2. The knee kick / pull is OFF. I tried this on 3 different headsets and every time is was the same thing, a 50/50 chance of getting it. If you overreach your hands the number goes up, but not enough. Again, having the training video would really help because you could go and watch and practice timing, height adjustment, etc. The left side seems to be worse than the right in accuracy here. We tried turning all lights on bright (better tracking), turning on only some, turning most off and only window light – nothing helped. This is the most irritating thing for me because you not only go down on the leader board but you get frustrated even trying to workout. 
3. Height adjustment seems to be off. I am 5’9” exactly. I put it in and my swings are off a little. I put 5’8” and my swings are better. Is there a way to have the app auto read height (like thrill of the fight)? 

How do you exit the app without the oculus button?"
1013,Suzie Anne,"Mar 31, 2022 at 8:53 AM",5,Good fun and a good workout,This is a fun and energetic workout app on the oculus. I Dona lot of cardio and exercise away from the oculus so I am not unfit. The intermediate 16 minute programmes have sweat running down my face and my oculus steaming up. Love it.
1014,Eva K,"Apr 7, 2022 at 12:56 AM",5,Great!,"I’ve taken Les Mills classes at gyms before and am missing it where I live now. Was happy to find this and even happier after trying it. Greta workout, super instructions and just really really great"
1015,Hussein,"Feb 15, 2022 at 11:51 AM",5,LES MILLS DID IT!,"------------------------------------
Update: After ~2 weeks of trainng
------------------------------------
Knee targets are getting easier to hit. Not sure if they fixed it, or if I'm getting used to it.
What I'd do is grab the robot thing, palms facing each other, then grab in front of me towards the knee before the target marker. I usually get it to record this way.

There are a few unmapped hooks near the end of a few high intensity workouts. I'm pretty sure they are unmapped as I missed them more than once.

My heart rate still gets above 150 bpm easily, and my max so far is 180 bpm (only reached it once). I'm pretty happy with the amount of sweat and activity I'm getting.

The only critical missing piece now is the cool-downs/stretches. I'm missing Supernatural for that, and it is not good to workout for 20 minutes, reach 180 bpm, and just walk away.
I do my own stretches, but I'd love to see something integrated within the workout. Same for warm-ups.

Overall, still 5 stars, I'm really happy with my purchase. 

------------------------------------
Initial post-launch review
------------------------------------
Just finished my first 20 minute workout, and my body is sore already. 
Workouts are balanced, target the whole body, focus on the form, and are really fun to do.
My max heart rate is 158 BPM, which I could never reach with Supernatural, at least not in 20 minutes.

There are a few minor issues related to tracking. Knee targets and hooks are hard to get right. Maybe it needs some tolerance there to record properly.

Music and environments are great. I'd love to see more, but for an initial release, this exceeds all expectations.

Buy this!"
1016,Lovat,"Mar 17, 2022 at 3:43 PM",5,Awesome Workout,"I've been waiting for this fitness app and it was worth the wait!  Totally awesome workouts, and very entertaining music and instruction.

1022,Hervé,"Apr 6, 2022 at 1:35 PM",4,Remember BOXVR ? it's better !,"This is a real close experience to BOX VR, but far better ! (I'm not talking about fitXR, I don't know it and I don't agree with subscriptions). It's fitness based on boxing techniques 
+  a wider range of moves
+ a better looking environment and UI. I'm talking about design not graphical techniques. Environements are beautiful (even if you just don't pay attention to them), The various punching pads are clear and you'll always know what to do and if you don't, coaches will often tell you. 
+ more entertaining/motivating (coaches, scores from other people)  
+ no subscription yet and the promise the base game won't disappear or be part of it if there's one like BoxVR (shame on those devs !)
+ various types of workouts (duration, intensity...)

but some things annoy me too.
- You don't keep tracks of your scores. Yout just know when you beat your highscore. What a bummer !! I want a leaderboard where you could see others scores by rank and watch your progress for each workout ! 
- the coaches can be really annoying (remember Shrek's donkey?) and repetitive !"
1023,Mike,"Mar 16, 2022 at 2:59 PM",5,Really good cardio app,"I originally wanted to check out other fitness apps and this was just the first in the queue. Love the range of different workout options and how they are paced. I have tried box-fit and a couple beginner and intermediate routines, all of them were pretty good.

Only issue would be that app fails to register about 20% of the knee kicks, which is expected since I use oculus and detecting knees is probably hard. Still, pretty satisfactory so far."
1024,젠장빨아,"Feb 5, 2022 at 1:09 AM",2,Subscription,"Sad to hear this will be a subscription later on. I already got burned by FitXR with the subscription route. Also, can something be done with the leaderboard being right smack dab in the front? It’s DISTRACTING. What about a setting to where you are able to play solo. You would be surprised at how many people are intimidated ( and for good reason)by multiplayer, even in a virtual setting. 
This game is “ just ok” nothing spectacular like people are raving about. It has potential but, right now not so much."

My only complaint so far is that on a few of the workouts,  a couple of the squats are way too low (like I almost sat on the floor to get underneath one of them) but most of the time, the squats are just fine too.  Fun way to get a workout done in VR!"
1027,Nanomele,"Mar 15, 2022 at 7:53 PM",5,Nice and fun!,"Fun to play, the voices that explain ad motivate are really helpful, the graphics are clean and functional. 
I feel the game as an exercise more than a game.
Could be similar in some way to beat saber ecc, but at the end is a different experience made to experience a workout.   The social part during every exercise is a nice touch, but sincerely I can't understand if it is live or is asynchronous in some way.
For now I can't understand how much can be used in some sort of daily long term use, but If they add some other exercise I think it will work well."
1028,Peej,"Mar 15, 2022 at 10:24 PM",5,Great fitness app for boxfit fans.,"As someone who has used the WiiFit to lose a ton of weight and get fitter over the years I was really disappointed that it was hard to find a good platform for fitness until now. Not only has Beatsaber rehabilitated the damage I suffered from two frozen shoulders but Les Mills Bodycombat is going to help me improve my fitness, agility and core strength... I know this because not only is this app really well designed and put together but it's really enjoyable to use. The game is responsive and fast to load with a set of great but tough workouts and coaches to teach you how to approach the moves.  I will never be a top athlete, but I do enjoy exercise apps that engage me and make the workouts fun so that I go back time and again. Here you use your hands and knees as well as core lunges and squats and there is a scoreboard to gamify as you play. I haven't fully explored it yet but I can already tell its going to be my go to daily fix. Please don't make things subscription based, I can't afford and won't pay for those and it would be a shame to lock users out. I'm happy to buy regular new workout packs or themed sets to keep things fresh. I'm excited to make this part of my daily VR routine!"
1029,MRH,"Mar 15, 2022 at 7:05 PM",5,First workout I've looked forward to!,"This is my first and probably only review on Oculus. I had to write in to give props to this amazing fitness game. I do about 15 minutes on my lunch break and it always leaves me drenched. I was amazed to find that I was sore in the days following my first workout. Sore muscles - without any weights or push-ups??

The game itself is very intuitive and easy to use. It follows the general format of a Beat Saber game but with targets flying at you that you have to punch, dodge, or crush with a high knee. The game is structure to get you punching as if you were in a boxing match - jabs, crosses, hooks, etc. It really *feels* good to smash those targets and see the big ring come flying out of a well thrown punch.

My only complaint is that the targets you crush with your knee seem to have the least reliable accuracy of anything else in the game. For some reason it decides I missed every 5th or 6th knee, though I can't for the life of me figure out what I'm doing differently to register the miss.

Otherwise, the game is just fantastic. I truly hope we see regular updates for the game, new works outs, etc. because I can imagine that after a few months of the stock work outs it *could* start to get boring. This is one of the few games out there I'd be willing to pay a subscription service for in order to ensure regular updates!!"
1030,Roger007VR,"Mar 15, 2022 at 12:03 PM",5,Gets you moving!,"I’m really impressed with this app. It gets me moving, I feel after like I’ve had a proper work out but without the drudgery of other home workout ideas.
The coaching motivation really works well for me and being in VR there are no distractions and many times I don’t realise how hard I’ve worked until the round finishes. I highly recommend!"
1031,Danilo,"Feb 27, 2022 at 10:38 PM",5,As long as no subscription model comes,Currently great fitness application for being original enough to not follow a subscription-based revenue model. Do try paid expansion packages instead of subscription models in the future if revenue drops.
1032,Mr.DILLIGAF,"Feb 11, 2022 at 4:00 PM",5,Good Synthesis of other Fitness Games,"I find that all VR fitness games have the same basic elements. Everything is built off of Beat Saber. I have basically tried and bought all of them just hoping something will stick.

It mostly resembles FitXR in punching mechanics. The obstacle squares/juking system with a forward shadow over the obstacle resembles OhShape. The coach talking throughout the music is like in SuperNatural.

The lack of subscription puts this one over the edge compared to peer games and gives it a 5 star rating. The experience itself feels like a SuperNatural workout without the meditation options. I think the Les Mills coaches talk way too much though. You won't even realize the song that's playing. The inclusion of knees is a neat concept too, but the game mechanics don't always register the knee strikes; I somewhat wonder if it's because by actually using your knees instead of cheesing for a high score that it's not properly detecting the effort of pulling your hands down.

If I'm being honest, I think SuperNatural is the best game for fitness, but if you want a 90% similar experience on a one-time fee, this is the best way."
1033,D4rkye,"Feb 4, 2022 at 3:38 AM",5,Best fitness thing ever,"Finally a polished workout app for VR, the exercises are great, the trainers, the music, the ques, everything, just get it and sweat like never before.

Quick tip to hit the knee targets: keep your hands up until the last second and drop them fast as your knee comes up, don't follow the trail with your hands or you'll miss. 

Thanks devs, you guys nailed it!"
1034,Vadgey,"Feb 4, 2022 at 6:47 AM",5,The best so far,"I use VR to get some decent cardio in. I've tried several other apps/games. There are some really good and fun ones out there, and some terrible. But this is the best I've used. It's the most well put together one I have seen. This isn't as much of a game as it is an actual workout program. You won't be slashing any blocks or bubbles. It is all business.

You can get an intense workout in and it has a purpose. The virtual trainers are pretty good and not overly chatty. Overall a very pleasant experience that doesn't seem like it will get annoying. 

There do seem to be a couple of flaws. Some hits don't register. If I had to guess, I'd say no more than 10%. I'm not sure if this is a bug or if it has to do with not registering the controllers because I have them back too far? I don't have that issue in any other app. It doesn't ruin the experience for a workout, but if you're a score chaser, it may be an issue for you.

Also the knees are a bit tricky. There is definitely a learning curve with them that I have not mastered. It doesn't register about 90% of them. I tried with a couple different techniques but no consistent luck yet. It is a GREAT concept though that I have not seen implemented in any other app. Again, it's not enough to ruin a workout and hopefully can be worked out.

Hopefully we will see some feedback and updates. I just hope they keep any subscription package affordable."

One down side- I tried hard to punch the centre of rings. It is prefect for me for most of the punches, except the straight punches. I don’t know and there are lots of straight punches that I lose quite some marks on it. The other one is my counts back to zero when I squat down with my guarding post. I guess it is because the sensor thought I was moving? 

Can developer look into it? 

Overall I like this games. If they have more updates, I don’t mind to pay for the add-on.

Keep it up!!!"

I having been using this app for 3 weeks now and can already see big improvements in my fitness, I am gaining muscle weight and losing inches. It is also hard to me to find a fitness routine that works every part of the body that doesn't end up straining my back. The exercise range is 5 to 20 minutes and you can choose what you want to do. The music in the background actually helps with the exercise and has even helped to gain some energy back when the track changes. If you are looking for a fitness app, I would highly recommend this one"

My family can’t be more happy with it, one time payment is a great plus (hope we can keep getting new routines).

Congrats to the developers and keep the great work!"
1043,Jas,"Feb 26, 2022 at 8:39 PM",1,Decent,"3rd review… the leaderboard and the sound of missing the targets are defeating. It’s hard to regain your momentum when your being hit by targets your combo score is zero and you dropped on the leaderboard.. 

The knee hits are impossible. I use the VR with hand weights to maximize my work outs . The target area is too small you have to be precise to get the hits. 


This game is better for teens or ppl who are super fit and want to have fun. I don’t think it’s encouraging or fun for people who are trying to lose weight or get in shape.. it’s discouraging.

This doesn’t make me want to try more it gives me anxiety and turns a workout into a difficult horrible process.

I’m over this game I’m sticking to supernatural."

I updated the headset, uninstalled and reinstalled the app but the issue remains. Very disappointing as the price is not worth it if only 3-4 workouts are working. 
I saw others reporting the issue but no fix or direct contact to a support team.

Sore all over and I love it! This is pretty serious stuff. This is why we work out. I think the instruction is great and it's fun. I hate the leader boards.

The only thing is that I'll click on most of the moderate ones and it starts before closing to the menu before 30 seconds is up.

1051,DeadCanDance,"Feb 6, 2022 at 9:20 AM",5,Best Fitness App - AND FUN.,"5 Star rating for:
 • Punches are synced to the beats!
 • Leadership board pushes you to stay ahead - perfect for competitive players
 • Trainers are very good 
 • Very well designed graphics and format

Ideas for improvement:
 • Create multi party option so friends can compete with one another plus others?
 • Can we keep a record of our best scores for each work out so we can strive to beat it in subsequent sessions? Or I should just follow the evolution graph?
 • Please don't make it subscription based - you can add extra workouts at a price just make sure the beats sync to the punches!

Finally, is it possible to select other music for same workout without losing the beats? I'd like to use this everyday and worry that I may get bored of the same music..
 
Thank you for making this app. I loved it so much I gifted it to friends.

Please keep it up!"

I've only tried the longer low intensity workouts and I was breaking out in a sweat before I knew it. The coaches really make you feel motivated and seeing them in VR is a really nice touch too. The workouts themselves are really fun. It's like Beat Saber but for exercising!

I can't wait to watch this app grow. So far it seems like it's gotten a lot of attention and high ratings. 

Hoping they keep it updated in the future!

Also I would love for the multiplayer to be more interactive. Like being able to chat with the people who you worked out with. Or being able to invite your friend into your workout session. I feel like that would be a huge motivation for my friends as well!!

1056,Viriya,"Mar 10, 2022 at 5:26 PM",5,Amazing experience with real benefits,"My wife and I have been playing Les Mills daily for a few weeks now. It has become our new routine and a break from taking care of a newborn.

This game is revolutionary. I’m hyping it a bit too much maybe but it could be the game that brings non-gamers to VR in droves.

We only have one genuine question. Will there be more content? I hope they will be more sessions, songs, and of course the environment. The arena is fine but it would be more awesome if more environments/locations can be unlocked.

The health benefits are real. It’s simply amazing to exercise and sweat. Finding time to exercise while raising a baby is almost impossible. Les Mills made it happen. Thank you!!!"
1057,Skull One,"Feb 7, 2022 at 1:31 AM",1,Four major flaws. Should have been fixed,"1) No setting to turn off other people.  
2) No setting to turn off the running commentary after you’ve heard it several times. 
3) Dodging mechanism is clumsy at best. 
4) Striking detection can be way off at times. 

First two are easy to fix but I find it appalling that the first item wasn’t included on release. Third should be able to tell if you’re in the circle or room boundary mode. If in room boundaries, the system should allow for a greater lean left and right. Fourth is the no brainer and amazed it wasn’t included. Variable sized targets to allow for beginners vs already trained. Size should be adjustable for beginners till they get used to the precise location you think should be struck. 

So much potential. Such glaring flaws."
1058,Azoic,"Mar 18, 2022 at 10:13 PM",2,Not worth it,"I was excited about another VR workout, particularly since there was a one-time payment available. The first time I used it, it was pretty cool. Did the basic workouts. There was matchmaking and could see the competition. There was a leaderboard. Next day I went to use it and all that was gone. Tried 5 different workouts of various levels. No lobby.

Further, the workouts themselves are slow and dont cause a burn. Though ironically, when there were people to compete against, in order to get a good explosion on the targets, you have to hyperextend your joints. 

How about the tech? Horrible. Just coming from Supernatural, the hit detection for the targets is soooo bad. Then the workouts are linear. Never saw any change of direction, just stances. So I was standing there bored half the time even on the max intensity workouts. 

Maybe this will be updated one day, but for now, I am asking for a refund."
1059,H-Dubs,"Feb 22, 2022 at 3:08 PM",5,Really gets the heart rate up!,"As someone who struggles to find the motivation to exercise, the reason I bought the Quest was because I really liked the idea of it 'gamifying' exercise. However, none of the apps available to date have really lived up to my expectations: you can get a bit out of breath and sweaty with the likes of Beat Sabre, Audio Trip, Racket NX, Pistol Whip etc, but none of them really enable sustained high intensity cardio, and to be fair, none of them claim to: and I've had a lot of fun playing them nonetheless. I'd hoped that 'Supernatural' would arrive in the UK at some point but I've been waiting over a year for that now and still no sign of it.
Now with the arrival of Les Mills Body Combat, I feel like my wait is over. It's beautifully designed, genuinely knackering when you choose the right level and the DOMS that have been kicking in a day or two after use are proof of the pudding that I'm getting a great upper body workout. The music isn't what I'd choose to play, but I think it's actually been really well chosen as I do find myself bouncing along to it. Still trying to get to grips with the knee kicks, but I'll get there.
And yes, love the Kiwis: I can see myself having a drink with them in the pub (but only after some intense body-combat style cardio, naturally!)"

1064,6DOF Reviews,"Apr 2, 2022 at 11:01 AM",4,"Great Exercise, Less Great Coaching!","If you're looking for a great fitness app on Quest, this is easily one of the top contenders! It dodges the subscription trap by giving you the option of just using the core features or going for the planned subscription if you want optional extras, but that's fair enough. The graphics are great, the workouts are great, and the only real issue with it (as with most games of the genre, unfortunately) is that the coaches can get somewhat annoying and are unresponsive to your errors, congratulating you even when you fail abysmally during a workout.

1065,Dezzy,"Feb 9, 2022 at 3:38 PM",3,"I want to love this, but can’t currently","Polished. Great graphics. No frame rate dips. Great workouts overall. Great coaching. Fast load times. It’s a VR boxer’s dream. Except..

The knee hits. I just can’t get them. I’ve tried so many different things to get it down, and can’t. I get that all new games, especially rhythm based, have a learning curve and you have to adjust/practice. But this is egregious. I’m at the top of the leaderboard for 90% of a 20min workout, only to get decimated during the last 10% of the workout because of the knee hits. It is absolutely immersion breaking. It’s frustrating. I’m not even that competitive but I want to be the best at this, and I can’t, because of the knee hits.

And clearly I’m not alone. If there are this many people having the same issue based on reviews I’ve read, I don’t think it’s a user issue. We shouldn’t be giving each other tips on how to maybe successfully hit the knee hits. That’s on the developers.

The knee hits consume me while I’m at work. They haunt my dreams. Everywhere I go, I’m seeing a 212-streak hitting 0 because of knee hits. The knee hits are King Joffrey to my Ned Stark. They are currently the greatest villain of pop culture in 2022. 

This is a-5 star app that needs to get out of its own way. Not going to ask for a refund because I’m hoping this gets addressed. 

TL;DR - Fix the knee hit issue. Make it work. Once that’s addressed, this will be the premier VR boxing game on all VR platforms."

I’m 5’1” and no matter how many times I reset my guardian or floor level I still have to jump to reach the high targets and am literally unable to hit both low targets at the same time as my reach isn’t big enough and I feel like this encourages an unhealthy range of extension. I tried to find a setting to recalibrate like Supernatural has but all I could find was my height setting and it didn’t help to lower it. Maybe if we had the option to turn off the leaderboard it wouldn’t be as discouraging but I love the idea of this app and it would be 5 stars for sure if they could fix the calibrations!

For me this is just fantastic that I can slip on a headset for a workout in my time.....when the monsters have gone to bed lol"
1075,Saf,"Mar 6, 2022 at 8:37 AM",5,Amazing fitness app with one flaw,"I have been using this all as a fun way to do cardio more regularly and it's really fun and genuinely gives you a workout. I personally find that it gives you a better workout than any other fitness app in the oculus store and I'd highly recommend it.

That I have one major issue - the app only detects my knee strikes around 20-30% of the time (hold arms high over head and slam past waist). It still gives a good workout but it feel a bit bad to feel like I've ""missed"" it even though I didn't IRL.

Another more minor gripe is that there are only 10 intense routines and even less of them are 20 mins. I only use the intense routines so the others are a bit of a waste for me.

That said, overall this is an amazing fitness games and I really like the balance of cheer and humor from the coaches (esp the kiwi dude)!"
1076,Ahlex,"Mar 6, 2022 at 4:42 PM",5,Awesome!,"I’ve tried a couple of times but yesterday I had a blast playing it. I still haven’t figured out the knee hits but I’ve read many people here saying that after they understood it, it became easy so I’m assuming that’s gonna happen to me as well. It’s such a nice technology and the fact it’s not subscription based makes it worth it. I’d not pay for a subscription but the app the way it is deserves 5 stars. Probably having new DLCs for a price would be the best choice for new content, but for now, 5 stars for sure!"
1077,Jei,"Apr 12, 2022 at 10:12 AM",5,EXCELLENT!!!!!,"HELLO Fast forward a month later, I STILL use this regurlarly in my workout regimen along with many other weights and modalities. I LOVE LOVE this game, not bias, not getting paid to say this at all, lemme clear your hesitation and concerns so you can buy this already:
1. This isn't subscription based, buy once get lots of workouts of different difficulties and durations! It is measured from easy to advanced, and 5 minutes to max 25 mnutes
2. There will probably be other users that appear in your first experience of gaming, if you want to turn off the social aspect, go to your settings in the menu, and you have the option to turn off the leader boards so you can focus on your workout
3. I dont know why...but if the trainers voice annoys you (sorry it gets to some people! :P) you can also adjust that in the settings to trainer voice off so you can focus on your workout and dont require any feedback. 
4. Knees knees knees! Do your best, it takes a bit of practice but the most important part is you get the benefit of the movement into your exercise, so don't feel discouraged!
5. This truly is a full body workout - as someone that trained in martial arts for 5 years i'll explain: 
jabs and crosses emphasize your chest muscles, and to exert more power, it requires you the entire kinetic chain as force, which comes from proper footing, to 
 rotation of hips, then to core, then out to your arms. You don't get the benefit of these exercises if you just rely on MOMENTUM or just throw your hands out alone, FEEL the muscles required for the movement, use correct form, that's how you get the most out of it. 

That's what people are typically concerned about :P now that I've cleared it up, buy this game already!"

The varying types of workouts in LesMills fits exactly what I am needing based on how energetic I'm feeling that day. They have different durations, difficulty, and I'm not even bored of the coaches scripted coaching yet ;). 

A couple things I would love to see in an update though:
1. Only adjust height at the beginning of the exercise, I was trying to add in a hop during my sky punches and suddenly the app thought I was 8ft tall the remainder of the round which certainly made the rest of the round interesting :D
2. Add a speedbag during some sections maybe, maybe at the end seconds and see how many hits one can put on it (just thought this would be a fun addition)"

I’ve never been this sore after a VR workout. I’ve found that the other VR workout games - Supernatural and FitXR - are fun, but they don’t make me exert myself nearly enough. Meanwhile, other boxing games like Thrill of the Fight result in me working out in an uneven way, and I don’t feel great afterwards. 

Right now, my lats, delts, quads, core, and hamstrings are all solidly sore. 

Where the game really delivers is by integrating unique moves that engage all different parts of the body (shout out to knee kicks, which is an insanely clever way to integrate the legs). Plus the social component keeps me more engaged than stats (which often just say I hit 99% of targets). 

Granted, I’m too sore right now to do this again, but I can guarantee that I’ll be playing this more to come."
1095,Patrick J,"Mar 3, 2022 at 1:52 PM",5,I thought fit VR was good but top title,"Now being certified personal trainer you have to get young your heart rate at least 80% per certain amount of time to lose body fat for getting their body fat breakdowns on and this really does it and they explain and tutorial for and then you put it together and it’s trust me they know if you’re not hitting it hard enough and it really challenges you but takes you to work much better place and work out and they know I mean your score depends on how hard you hit when you’re supposed to hell you dodge they take everything in consideration it’s a very well thought out game, and definitely my top boxing not just cardio either Tony squats and very advanced or very beginner the advanced are super hard and rewarding!"
1096,The Sticks family,"Mar 3, 2022 at 8:51 PM",5,I’m enjoying exercise?,"This is fun and motivating. The 2 people in the app inspire and motivate you to do more and push harder. There are 5 minute to 20 minute exercises as well as 3 different levels and different routines. I find myself wanting to do another exercise even though I just did 2 and am exhausted. 
I’m still working on coordination to connect the high grab / knee slam part but I guess I need more practice. 
I highly recommend for anyone wanting to enjoy getting fit or staying fit."
1097,Samantha,"Mar 16, 2022 at 1:10 AM",5,Great exercise app,"Challenging and fun! My favorite exercise app up to now. A feel of the app supernatural but inside the gym. They could improve the visual but the exercises do work my full body, got me sweating and my muscles working while having fun."

1100,Wendy,"Feb 9, 2022 at 11:02 PM",2,Target issues,"So, I get a great workout, which is really the most important thing. BUT, this app needs an updates and some fixing.
When hitting a target with your knee (knee strikes) it's insanely frustrating that it says I missed the target when I clearly hit it. This is going to make a lot of people unmotivated to keep going. While the workout is the most important part, watching your score go down when you've most definitely hit all the knee targets is discouraging. You're going to lose a lot of customers. It's all I keep seeing on fb, is how frustrating the knee strikes are. Please fix this issue. 🙏 
Maybe make the bullseye (middle of the target) bigger or whatever you need to do to fix it. When this issue is fixed, I'll gladly give you a 5 star rating."

1104,BadPidge,"Feb 8, 2022 at 10:17 PM",3,Needs work,"This exercise game will make you sweat but does have issues:

1) tracking is off and every punch feels like it is late
2) not able to turn off/down the instructors
3) repetitive and cheesy motivational quotes
4) music is already repetitive after 2 days
5) analysis of your scores and exercise is very limited
6) navigation through the exercise menu is clunky (vertical scrolling is hit and miss)

Feels like an early release and perhaps it should have been marketed as such to avoid disappointment.  

This looks very good but at the moment there are better games out there.

8 workouts completed before this review"
1105,Koren,"Mar 2, 2022 at 3:15 PM",5,So fun you don’t realize you’re working,Love this better than taking the class itself.  Having targets and the stellar instruction from master trainers Rachel Newsham and Dan Cohen I feel has improved my technique.  Not to mention the loads of calories I burn as a workout.  Love it love it love it.  Hoping Les Mills comes out with The Trip and Body Attack on the Oculus too!!
1106,JayTee41,"Apr 19, 2022 at 2:06 AM",5,Love it!,"Never the same workouts, feel energized after  done playing."
1107,cvan,"Feb 5, 2022 at 5:28 PM",3,Good but changes are needed,"The workout feels good but is devoid of any real information at its conclusion so while it felt great, it was an empty feeling afterwards. I did a workout, came in first in the list and the trainer said I almost reached the 90 percent but there was no information given about what I missed. You are given a score. That's it. You have no idea what it's based on, what your accuracy or power was, calories burned, etc. There's just nothing there. 

You don't have a profile. You don't set goals. It doesn't seem to track anything. There's no list of workouts that I have done so I have to favorite them so I remember. 

The trainers talk for the entire time you are in this app. Music is definitely not a major element of this workout as you can barely hear it. Trainers cannot be muted or lowered in volume. I like trainers in my ear. If you don't, you will be disappointed. 

Forced multiplayer needs to be an option rather than a requirement. This cannot be emphasized enough.

Haptic and punch feedback when targets are hit is weak. How satisfying is it to hear the slash and haptics in Beat Saber? It's not prominent at all here. 

Coach voice is at times out of sync with the targets, especially fast alternative left/right flurries. It just feels off at times. Not a wireless issue.

The knee grabs can be frustrating. Half of them didn't register despite my steady cadence and you can't revisit the tutorial so the only way to practice them is to participate in a competitive online workout against others and practice them as they show up. Not a good system. 

I'm on the fence about this one. I wish there was a fitness app that had a campaign element that started you on a path and had a linear progression for the first month that you complete and then can cherry pick workouts. 

The forced multiplayer may be a dealbreaker for me. It bears repeating: my workouts are my own. It's not motivating to be forced into competition with others."
1108,SantaB,"Feb 4, 2022 at 2:57 AM",5,"Reality check, I need some exercise","Love to see how my workout compares to others during the session. I knew I'm out of shape but seeing how bad my results are compared to others that's a realization that I need to come back and back again to get recked.

I'm going back in as soon as I  get my breath back again."
1109,Guamy,"Mar 28, 2022 at 7:55 AM",5,Omg,At first I didnt think it would be much but a game. I totally don't think that now. After trying it. It was gun the coaches are great. I had a blast while working out.
1110,Paul,"Feb 9, 2022 at 11:08 PM",5,No hidden costs,"What a relief. Unlike other fitness apps this is a one off purchase and actually really good! Motivational and varied as well as fun. You won’t realise how hard you’re working out. 

I hope the developers don’t go the way of XR and go to a subscription model. That would suck."
1111,IDontMoan,"Apr 14, 2022 at 6:51 AM",4,Awsome but missing one key thing for me,I’m not a big fan of some of the music I know we have the option to turn off the trainers coaching you if you could add the option to turn off the music it would be absolutely perfect
1112,TamPat,"Mar 1, 2022 at 4:13 PM",5,Best VR fitness workout,"Always been a fan of Less Mills programs in the past in real life and have time many times body combat too years ago. 
I had great expectations knowing I can expect always a good workout. Surprisingly they went beyond my expectations and never have sweat so much in VR. I really like high intensity training and the scoring really pushes you to give it your all. I like that the exercises are not boring and its not just boxing but a full body workout."
1113,Chloe Stanley,"Mar 1, 2022 at 9:25 PM",5,"Amazing Game, has good potential","When I saw this game I had a jaw dropping moment, wondered how I had missed les mills being on VR and immediately downloaded! Then realised I hadn’t missed much as it’s only just been released this month. I LOVED LOVED LOVED the les mills body combat at the gym. It was the only type exercise I have ever enjoyed. I was gutted when my gym stopped doing it. And it’s not quite the same doing the on demand on your tv, it just doesn’t quite feel as fun as the classes did. 

Anyway… this game is fun! So much better than the fit XR as there are more moves/variation and better choreographed, love the knee move too! I find the talking really helpful and motivational, haven’t got to the point of it being repetitive but from other reviews it may come… 

I think this game has SO much potential. And I have no doubt that les mills will continue to improve it and grow it. 

Couple of suggestions for the developers if they do read this :) thinking about what could make it more like the real gym class and separate it from other VR workouts 

1. maybe an actual ‘class’ section where you could be in a body combat class with other bodies around you all following the instructor at the front.  Although maybe not avatar bodies as this would probably feel fake but some prerecorded bodies (like Dan and Rach) would be good with an instructor at the front to copy the moves.

2. In the body combat classes I attended we would go through some  moves during the first part of the song and then put them altogether for a fast pace second half of the song. Like building the routine up with several moves, some element of this would be excellent in the game (whether it’s the targets flying towards you, or a virtual class setting) 

3. There was a move we did in class that I think could easily be used in VR. Staying In a squat position with arms bent on each side of waist with a fist and  punching alternate arms forward  and twisting the arm 180 degrees as you punch"
1114,Steve-a,"Mar 3, 2022 at 8:31 AM",5,I never leave reviews but!,"I never leave reviews but have to leave one for this. I’m a fairly fit 54 year old bloke and I have been looking to take my fitness up a level after using a few other boxing apps before hitting the gym in the morning. I decided to treat myself for my birthday yesterday and got this.I love it, it’s just what I was looking for and it’s very addictive . I have to remind myself it’s not just a game but a full body workout and not go in it too often( 3 times yesterday and twice today). I have no doubt this will help me lose the last of that old man gut I’m struggling to shift. If your looking to sweat out the lbs then this is for you"
1115,Arianna,"Apr 4, 2022 at 10:07 AM",5,Great workout and much more,"I love martial arts and this game has great workout.
But I ll love multyplayer mode like beat saber (for example) and much more typing of training.
I hope they ll not do membership.
Better sell pack with specific workout"
1116,Mike,"Mar 1, 2022 at 10:23 PM",5,Great morning jump start!,"I asked my Son to download this app on his Q2 and now we workout together in the mornings.  Could the developers take a look at adding a tutorial on where to hit and aim at the targets for a better score.  It is talked about, but not shown, maybe even a grid to the side to show where your last hit landed?"
1117,Jeff,"Feb 5, 2022 at 1:00 AM",5,My new favorite app?,"Thrill of the Fight has been my go-to app since I got my Oculus, I love the boxing simulation and it’s a great workout. I used the Les Mills app for 15 minutes today and I can already tell I may have a new favorite. Great workout, a lot of fun, and the instructors are good without being corny. Love that there is no subscription. 

For those having trouble with the knees, focus on smashing on the target and not so much on your knee and that did the trick for me. 

If you are looking for a fitness app or if you like boxing/martial arts workouts GET THIS APP. Easily worth the 30 bucks."
1118,soya,"Apr 9, 2022 at 11:20 AM",5,Super good Still rated as my fav in VR,"I can be sick of beat saber.  But not this one.  Btw, any upgrade soon? Add some other types of workout?"

1122,Omtose,"Feb 4, 2022 at 3:25 PM",4,Nice! could do with…,"First and importantly: I freaking love BodyCombat. Did my first “live” class in 2005-ish and was hooked (haha see what I did there) from the get go. So I am a bit biassed. The app is great, reminds me a bit of Beat Sabre but with combat moves. Love Dan and Raches comments. I am hoping for some improvements: I would like to connect my fitness watch and chest strap HRM to the app (I think supernatural has that option) and I would also love a real multiplayer mode where you can smash the workout with your friends. oh, and the Oculus 2 has the option to use your hands in stead of a controller but unfortunately this app does not seem to allow for that (no brainer, guys!) Otherwise it is really good. I’ve only had it for 2 days but really liking it.  Remember: keep it real and stay with the fight!"
1123,Heather,"Feb 28, 2022 at 8:12 PM",5,WOW,"I'm always trying to find apps and games that are a great workout on my Oculus Quest 2, and so far this is my FAVORITE. I am a certified group fitness trainer, and I teach classes 5 days a week, 40 minutes each at my local gym. Due to this, I'm always looking for new additions to my personal fitness goals.

Positives:

1. Super easy to follow instructions. 

2. Calibration was GREAT for me. I had no issues whatsoever with the high targets being too high. I did make sure to redraw my boundary before trying it, though.

3. Non-subscription based!!  I LOVE THIS! I don't want to pay a monthly fee. I'm very happy with the $30 I spent!

4. Great background music and motivation from trainers. I really felt like they were speaking directly to me.

5. After just 14 minutes consisting of 2 separate workouts, I was dripping sweat and my heart was pounding!

Negatives:

1. I agree with other reviewers about the score board. I feel like this can be very distracting and may also make people new to fitness feel as though they aren't doing well enough and cause them to get discouraged. I also wish this could be turned off so I could just focus on myself and my own goals. The fact that we are off the couch and moving is a win already!!

2. That's literally my only negative as of right now!

I'll definitely continue to use this as an addition to my daily fitness goals"
1124,meduzo,"Feb 4, 2022 at 8:31 PM",5,Pleasant surprise!,"I was ready to dismiss this one as ""other fitness app of the bunch"". I was wrong... This thing makes you move, makes you sweat more than any other app, and while it's not fun, it doesn't try to...

This is a serious fitness game, you'll get invested in it, you'll get entertainment out of it, and most importantly, you'll burn some calories.

It let's you choose by time, intensity and part of body you want to work out. This works as a great tool since you can just look at the time and choose the workout you can do within your timeframe.

Great app overall! Super polished, felt like being really at a boxing class."
1125,Eño,"Feb 4, 2022 at 2:53 PM",5,Just Incredible,"This was made by professionals, and it shows.

I was sweating and wishing it was over within no time (in a fun, workout kind of way). 
There’s even a leader board so you can compete against others (but you’re not standing next to them as you train.. which I like, being the recluse that I am). 
WELL worth the money and even though the instructors aren’t talking to you personally, it’s done in such a way that it feels like they are."
1129,MrTimo,"Feb 27, 2022 at 2:55 PM",5,No Regrets,"Ok, so i have only just purchased this today. I have doen 3 of the workouts and my god, can i feel them.

I will be able to do a workout in the morning in my room no problems, and it will set me up for the day just like when i have been to my local gym. Great addition to my life. Lets see what the results are in a few months. 👍"
1130,Smjay26,"Feb 27, 2022 at 3:25 AM",5,Excellent fitness game,"I’ve used both Supernatural and FitXr for a long time now. Both are great and they can allow you to get a good sweat/cardio workout if you actually put speed and power into it. But this one knocks it out of the park. I’ve never felt so sore after a VR fitness workout than this one! It’s fun, challenging, and really works your upper and lower body. 

I hope down the road they add more music selections cause the same songs can get repetitive but other than that still hands 
down the best VR fitness app out there. Can’t wait to see what’s next. 

Ps love the fact you can play offline. The other fitness apps won’t even load if you have a poor internet connection or they disconnect in the middle of a workout. Nothing worse than not being able to get a workout in cause internet decides to run slow lol

Keep it up guys! 10/10"

My advice if your new to boxing watch a few youtube videos how to throw a jab and straight uppercuts and hooks so you don't hurt yourself. 

I think this will be apart of my morning routine ."

1136,Lauren Russell-Daniel,"Feb 7, 2022 at 11:23 PM",3,Amazing but….,"I love this idea, I enjoy the coaching team, I like the music. I want to like everything about it but I don’t. There are things that could be fixed and make it so much better.

*Tutorial: If you want to add a guest or want to go back on your own there is no way to go back to the tutorial.

*Progress tracking: It would be great if there was a way to see the ones you have done in a list or with a score or something on it.

*Missed targets: I am a lover of boxing and often times this says things have been missed when I know they have not. Seems the calibration is off. If this had the auto height detection it would probably help. 

*Warm up/ Cool down: There isn’t any! For something that is a much of a true workout as this app is, you truly need this or people are going to hurt to bad to want to continue.

*Scenery options: Give us a little more to look at. Feels like I’m in a brown globe and that I can see getting old.

*OG’s: once this all gets fixed don’t make us original players pay subscription prices and ruin it. 


*More: Simply put they need more options. Maybe daily workouts for each range. Where it is now it feels like I paid for a Beta stage workout app. 

It is a great workout and one that will leave you wanting to do more and you will feel it the next day. It just is so limited and the interface isn’t as smooth as I would have expected. This app has the potential to blow other workout apps out of the water, but will need to seriously add a lot more content and user friendly updates.

I would still buy it because it is fun and a great workout. However it’s not going to replace anything yet."
1137,HAS,"Mar 21, 2022 at 10:32 PM",5,Fitness has never been so fun,I love this! It has made cardio such fun and I can happily spend a good 45 mins on this. That said even the 10min workouts have me dripping with sweat and my heart pounding. Fantastic.

The movements are all about intensity and how hard you throw the punch. You are given points based on how hard and precise you hit.  The scoreboard is great for the competitive (any fellow CrossFitter should get this for sure).
Just get it. You won’t be disappointed if you’re actually looking for a good workout and want to give it your all."

1143,Moogarnett,"Feb 6, 2022 at 12:19 PM",1,Coach feedback doesn't match gameplay,Before I decide whether to return or not are their plans to make the coaches comments more reflective of actual game play? I've had stuff like you'll do better next time when I've been top of the leaderboard and equally some wow look at where you are on the leaderboard when I've been bottom. You can miss every one (which I am doing with the knee moves) and get still feedback on how well you are doing. The pre-saved sentences do not at all match game play.   It makes the game frustrating to play.

Plus it was FUN and the coaches are great. It feels like they’re actually there instead of it just being a game. 

My ONLY complaint/suggestion is if your form is off, (which tends to happen when you’re tired, especially in a video game) it will count your blocks as a miss even if you hit them. That’s totally fine, but I think there should be a different color or noise for when you miss/vs when your form is 👎. 
I was getting pretty frustrated because I was hitting the blocks, but it wasn’t until I started doing the proper form that it was counting them again. It definitely got me to keep pushing, but I think it could get pretty frustrating if you’re tired, pushing and thinking you’re missing/there is something wrong with your controllers/oculus/the game, especially if you don’t make the connection back to your form."
1150,Astralmind,"Feb 9, 2022 at 9:41 PM",4,"A great workout, a barebones app","I'm no fitness expert, in fact I'm quite the opposite - a true couch potato. However, with the pandemic I turned to VR to get moving at least a little and found that for me this might have been the platform I needed all along. I have tried most fitness/rythme games in VR and can say Les Mills does a lot extremely well.  

The workout themselves feel like they're very well designed with full body impact and the variations and repetition in movements appears to be highly effective. As a workout program, Les Mills seems to be well beyond what the others are offering. To many, that should suffice to make it their #1 choice. Wrapping up a 25 minutes medium intensity WO is enough to give me that sense of accomplishment.  I appreciate the live leaderboard and the scoring system that seems to be well designed (meaningful numbers). The coaches scripts are true and tried in their formula and works well in keeping you focussed and plowing through - it gives an honest gym vibe, something I initially dreaded and eventually found myself enjoying.

As a VR application however it is  ...minimal. No options or settings to customise anything, UI that consists of 30 titles representing the 30 workouts somewhat grouped that sometimes don't scroll the way you want, environment reminiscent of BoxVR (2017), music is more rythmes than known or fun tracks, canned recorded coaches lines sometimes are dramatically mismatched to your current situation (celebrating a streak or asking you to do better in a pre recorded format regardless of what's going on is easily noticeable, especially after a few runs).  None of these are major hindrance that will keep you from enjoying a great workout but I`m hoping the polish will come further down the line because it is otherwise a very efficient workout program."
1151,MakoVR,"Feb 24, 2022 at 12:47 AM",5,Awesome workout,"This is a very fun way of doing real sports in VR. The workouts are challenging and right now I only need 15 minutes in the app to really feel exhausted. Do yourself a favour and start slow and with the shortest workouts, otherwise your whole body might hurt in case you are not used to this type of training. Also you better don't do it 2 days in a row at the beginning, even though it is so motivating..

Some features that would make the app even better for me:
-Some kind of warm up and cool down procedure (I currently use other VR games likes beatsaber for that..)
-Option to show a video of an instructor while doing the workouts. Sometimes I am not 100% sure I do everything exactly right so this would be helpful.
-In the menu: a list of the last few workouts I did, so it's easier to find them in case I want to repeat a training"

Setting the bar to be like beat saber and to say have add on packs would be awesome. 

But I agree the overhead grab and smash to knee is hard and I almost never land them correctly.

Some really cool environments too.

1159,Pete,"Feb 22, 2022 at 3:19 AM",5,Great fitness app!,I had been playing another fitness app that got greedy went subscription based and I just refuse to pay a monthly subscription for a game. How many subscriptions do they really think we're going to pay each month? It's ridiculous.  I just want to buy the game and own it.  I've been using Les Mills for about a week and I'm really enjoying it.  It's a better full body workout than the others I've tried with the knees and variety of targets. It really gets my heart rate up and I'm sweating by the end.  I was having issues with uppercut and hook punches but I noticed they are much much better after they released a patch. So thank you developers for listening to reviews and being responsive to issue.  The coaches do talk a lot.  I prefer to just listen to music and get into a groove but I've gotten used to it.  Overall this would be my first choice of all the apps I've tried and would absolutely recommend it as long as they stay away from the subscription trap.  Please please don't do that to us!!!
1160,ShADoW-X,"Mar 17, 2022 at 7:24 AM",3,Missing advertised feature,"First off, the app is a great workout. Very clean, works well, provides a good raise in heart rate each and every time. 

It does what it sets out to achieve and I would love to give it a higher rating but everything outside of the workouts is broken.

I have been stuck in ""OFFLINE MODE"" since purchase and can't access any of the additional functionality. 

Leaderboards?...nope! 
Keeping track of my progress?.....nope!
Even options that were supposedly added in the recent patch (turn off trainer voice, change to metric, etc)?..... nope!

I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times with no change.

On one hand I love the app and use it daily. On the other hand I feel ripped off that most of it doesn't work properly."
1161,Uglycrier,"Mar 17, 2022 at 6:34 PM",3,Almost perfect but still worth it!,"As someone who will stop working out as soon as I start getting tired and sweaty (which, of course, defeats the purpose), I am LOVING this app and find myself wanting to get into it several times a day!  Just a few thoughts off the top of my head…
 
PROS:    
·    I can make as many embarrassing noises and awkward movements as I want in the PRIVACY OF MY OWN HOME.

·    ONE-TIME REASONABLE COST to purchase – after wasting obscene amounts of money over the years for gym memberships that ultimately went unused after 1-2 weeks, I’ve vowed to never “donate” to an exercise membership again.

·    SEEING THE LEADERBOARD during workouts pushes me to try and maintain those top spots and/or pushes me to work harder when I see my score starting to fall towards the bottom. 
 
CONS:   
·    Speaking of the Leaderboard, I thought the players in the lobby (that I was waving at and showing off my boxing moves to) were other actual players but it sounds like they’re not..?  That was discouraging since I’m kind of driven by competition.  I get that some people prefer to be solo, but a MULTIPLAYER OPTION WOULD BE GREAT so that I can compete against friends and other players to make me push a little harder (would add one more star for this).

·    The MENU IS REALLY DIFFICULT to navigate around in – it’s very ‘bouncy’ and I have a hard time getting it to stop where I want so that I can click on a Start button when I find the workout I want.

·    As others have said, the KNEE KICKS ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE!  I would love to be able to do some full body workouts but I can’t even master the Tutorial and have barely been able to get 2 or 3 successful kicks each time (would add another star if this could be made a bit easier/better).
 
IN CLOSING – This is totally worth the one-time fee, IMO!  Even though I haven’t tackled any full body workouts yet, I still feel like I’m working my lower body with the squatting and side movements (I have been sore from shoulders to thighs since I started doing this a few days ago!)!  Please don’t bother with the subscription option – I know people that have cancelled their subscription to SN because they just didn’t want that monthly fee commitment anymore.  Maybe just roll out the occasional DLC that contains new workout packages and/or perhaps the ability to ‘unlock’ some bonus workouts and other options like different music, instructors, etc, when you hit certain levels or achievements and just building on what’s already there.  This app is good but has a lot of potential to become THEE BEST workout app out there!"
1162,Kate,"Feb 13, 2022 at 9:37 PM",3,Kicks!!!!,I think this has the potential to be an amazing fitness game but it ruins both my mojo and my streaks because the kicks just never work.

1164,Eric,"Mar 14, 2022 at 7:48 AM",4,Very Nice fitness app,"I’ve used the app a few days now, so I get the gist of it, and overall it’s really nicely done. My shoulders are certainly sore today. And while I would love to see some add-ons, namely an option to turn down the voice overs and turn up the tracks, especially after playing the same lesson multiple times, I would still highly recommend it, especially when compared to other fitness apps out today."
1165,DawnMonkey,"Feb 3, 2022 at 8:40 PM",3,Confused,"The game took a long time to download, and looked caught in a loop. I clicked on ""cancel"" to cancel the download and it had already installed. So off to a weird start.

The game says ""single user"" in the description but when I finished the tutorial and tried a class, suddenly it was connecting to a bunch of other users.

Is it actually multiplayer? Is there any way to turn the multiplayer function off? I couldn't find any class settings. I want to be able to use it solo. If you can only work out with other players it should say so.

Also it requires a weight. It accepted ""000"" but there should be an opt out.

The tutorial was fine, the trainers seem fine, the mechanics I think are fine, at least in the tutorial,  but so far I'm not exactly bowled over by the experience."
1166,Beans Haricots,"Feb 22, 2022 at 12:44 AM",5,Very good fitness app,"So far , I’m loving it!  I’ve been using Supernatural for months but really only use it for the boxing workouts.  The Flow workouts just aren’t intense enough.  LM Body Combat workouts are even more intense!  

My only criticism is the syncing of the music and targets seems off and not as tight as SN.  I’d be ok turning off the music completely, as there are only a few generic tracks anyway.  I’ve had no problems with the knee strikes, as some others have reported.  I should also mention, it has not crashed on me once in the couple weeks I’ve been using it.  

For the battle rope exercises, it would be cool to actually have a rope that extended from your hands out to the horizon.   

Great job!"
1167,Blaine,"Feb 21, 2022 at 1:55 AM",5,Awesome fitness app with no subscription,"Highly recommend this for great cardio exercise. I do this at home when the gym doesn't have a class. I like the no subscription as I don't want to pay on top of going to the gym. The live scoreboard is a great way to keep you going. I can't say enough good things about it. I've told all my friends about it. It's great to see more men on here. I'm usually the only man in my gym classes (I'm not complaining).

I have recommendations that would make it even better. Of course, more tracks in the future. I'm fine paying for premium content if it's worth it. More time in between songs to wipe off sweat. Have some core and stretch tracks (can just have music and coach). Able to see avatars and/or talk with competitors in real time. To be able to turn off the coach voice after you've done a track a number of times, instead of just off or on for everything."
1168,Valinor,"Feb 21, 2022 at 4:40 AM",5,Compliments in gym bodycombat,"Nice addition to an in gym class.  Both have strong points

VR version:
1. Enforces accuracy and pushes power hits
2. Good for arms
3. Lots of squats - and they are deep
4. Enforces speed and timing
5. Can't ease off and relax or your score goes down

Needs a mode to calibrate targets. I find best place to hit is the outside ring of target halfway between up and inside (toward other controller)

Needs a practice mode.  I have problems with knees.  New tutorial helps but I need more practice.

Needs better audio feedback to differentiate a hit, not so good hit and a miss.  Also signal if hit was too soon or too late.  

Lots of bugs. Game turns off video, freezes with black screen and more.  Happens more often after a bit of play when I'm hot and sweaty.  Game is new, so bugs are expected. But they need to be fixed quickly.
 
In-gym class:
1. Lots more legs - lunges, kicks, ...
2. Pushups and bodyweight exercises
3. Can ease off if needed
4. Running jumping moving L and R ...
5. Social aspect"
1169,Websnappers,"Feb 14, 2022 at 10:47 PM",3,A few updates away from greatness,"TL;DR: If you are already kind of fit and/or use VR fitness apps regularly, this app is a worthy addition, even in its current state. If you are more like me, then a few more updates are required to be worth the asking price.

Here are my likes, dislikes and suggestions for the devs:
- Create a training section, with 2 classes dedicated to each move type. The 1st class is a tutorial, with videos of the instructors doing the moves. The pace is slow and the goal is to practice getting the sweet spot for the power rings. The 2nd class is a little faster and with different combo variety, again to practice getting the sweet spot. (Class 1 -> simple jab and cross, Class 2 -> faster and combos like jab->jab->cross)
- Allow the user to create class playlists than can be saved. I currently can only handle low intensity, but low intensity classes are so short , I have to go back to the menu 4 or 5 times to workout for 30 minutes.
- Keep the silhouettes that appear on the obstacles. That feature is awesome!
- Always give the users as many options as possible: Leaderboard On/Off, Coaches Audio On/Off, Units of measurement Imperial/Metric, etc.
- I personally enjoy the coaches during the workout, but maybe minimize the ""Check out the combo"" or ""Look at that leaderboard"" (especially if not dynamic) and maximize things like describing the workout (""we're adding uppercuts to this combo"") or ""we're doing that combo 3 more times"" .
- You've said that the future subscription service is still undecided. I wonder if you've considered a bundles or season pass approach like regular games? So you could have separate DLCs for low, medium, and high intensity, as well as DLC for new locations or music. Users could buy just the DLCs they want a la carte, or buy a discounted season pass that would include everything released that year. 
Will add 1 star if class playlists are added.
Will add 1 star if a training section is added.
Will update review when subscription service is implemented."
1170,Flickerink,"Feb 23, 2022 at 2:17 PM",4,"Fun, real fitness: first impressions","This game is great! For a person who's fitness got blugeoned by the pandemic/winter and lost any level of athleticism, it's actually kind of a godsend. I'm out of shape now so it absolutely made me sweat to a pretty disgusting amount on the ""moderate"" levels, but suspect it would have raised my heart rate acceptably back when i was in good shape.

Didn't think i would like the leaderboards/social aspect but it actually made me try harder than i probably would have. It's just an updating scoreboard, but it works! (+it's optional. You can turn it off)

Wishlist:
I *really* wish i could compare scores/streaks with my friend list.

Wish there were more levels for each difficulty. There are only about 4 or 5 each atm, (various lengths. Some as short as 4 minutes others, 10-20) but that means you have to replay them more than is appealing if you actually want to do this regularly. That'll get old fast. Hopefully they continue to add new tracks.

Height calbration would be nice as it seemed off but it didn't ruin my experience at all.

Thank god it's not subscription based. Would probably be okay paying a little for DLC packs or something though."

An option from instructional VO only would be appreciated because those lines really do help keep the rhythm of the track going. It's needs continued support with additional courses and minor TLC here and there, but as is it is my favorite workout software since wii fit.

Am just doing the low and medium intensity workouts so far, working my way up to try a high intensity one at some point... don't think I'm ready yet though. These are serious workouts!

I lacked a bit of motivation and by chance in a boxing group I fou d a reference to the Oculus Quest.
I must say this is almost as intensive then a BagClass. Love it.
What is a bit unnerving for people who know the basic kickboxing movements is that there is no settings I could find to disable the recurring intros and dry runs.
What I am also struggling with is the accuracy of the knees to target and the speed increases to a level where I cannot get them all. 
The sideways downwards double handed strikes also are not accurate enough.

Maybe this is because of my training to keep the eyes on what is happening in front of you and not below? Meaning the hand controllers are not detected by goggles.
Also the screen seems to be offset slightly to the right from center. Don’t know how to fix that. 
I usually wear glasses with a strong difference in ‘strength’ if the glasses, as I do not wear them for the workouts, this maybe plays a role.
Anyway, a settings tab would be great to adjust speed, height etc

1176,Meishseeks,"Mar 4, 2022 at 8:09 AM",4,Good sweaty workout,"I feel this maybe geared more towards the bodycombat ultra fit fitness professional as its quiet hard to keep your combo , if you dont hit exact in the middle then your combo disappears  ,&  I also cannot get the knee strikes for the life of me , I grab , follow until there is just the circle and slam down on my lifted knee but nothing, also if your arms are tried  & there is combos close together it's difficult to be as accurate as the game needs you to be and I feel like I'm over extending my arm in order to punch as hard as needed. 

I do want to stick at it because it such as good workout , im sweating , out of breath and my sore shoulders,arms & legs and my calorie count on my smart watch (if accurate ) show that it's an amazing calorie burner, i do like the coaches as it makes it like the body combat  classes at the gym & on the les mills on demand classes although  the commentary is repeated and repetitive , there is only so many things you can record. if possible 
I would like to see more intense workout outs for noobs like me and maybe not such a strict accurate strike system I know the game is all about technique but for uncoordinated non body combat professional like me , it maybe to strict , I am looking forward to what's to come and I hope more  les mills workouts  get introduced to vr like body attack
Also  I have to enter my height in inches & centimetres , so not sure if I have gotten my height right
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Another update》 after the knee strike tips from the developer , I am now hitting those knee strikes only fails now is if i laps in my technique or my arms get fatigued & I don't bring the controllers down hard enough past my knee. Cheers 4 the tip 😀

Update : there was an update available as of today 17th of Feb 2021. After this I then noticed an arrow to the right when I clicked to edit my profile(maybe its always been there ) this allowed me to change my height to imperial measurement and I could then change it to my correct height, this has improved my combos > still cannot get the hang of those knee strikes unsure what I'm doing wrong"

(I'm Dutch. English is not my first language, so please forgive me for the mistakes) 
I'm used to playing BeatSaber and other rythm games but as a former Les Mills instructor, I was thrilled to find BodyCombat in the Oculus store! At first I was impressed by the appearence of the 3D-instructors. Almost real! I immediately started practising and playing, until my muscles were starting to hurt. I loved it!
But...after a few times I noticed some glitches in the game (tracking problems, not exploding while hitting hard and straight in the middle), the constant appearance of the 3D-instructors twice before every training session started to annoy me. Also, the 'pep talk', that motivational speech during training, keeps repeating the same sentences and giving the same tips, even when I'm improving my posture and position. I just wish there were some options to adjust player settings, where you can turn the instructor's voice/appearence on or of. 
And please fix the glitches.
Then it could be a great training game!

So I tried the first session, 5 minutes, and again every hook or uppercut I missed. 
I'm not that tall, and the app had measured me as 1m63, while according to the last measurement I was 1m69. So I tried adjusting my height to 1m67, just to be sure, but that was no improvement.
I really like the workout. The gym overhere also has Les Mills classes, but missing every hook? every uppercut? 
I'll be trying a couple of more session, but if this stays that way it might become a refund. :(

UPDATE: Love to get in touch, read somewhere you guys use discord. That's a lot easier.
I'll have another try tomorrow morning. Perhaps I started just before the update was released.
Anyway... I'll let you know.

UPDATE 2: Tried another session this morning. Hit a few uppercuts, only when I fully extend my arm. forward, almost overreaching. For the hooks I have to turn my body completely to the side, so the target is in front of me. It's really frustrating."

I’m not a gamer, I bought my quest to motivate me into keeping fit. I have lots that I enjoy such as Audio Trip, Oh Shape, Thrill of the Fight, Pistol Whip and Beat Saber. I wasn’t too enamoured by the sales video and was about to decide against it when I read the reviews. These were good, so I bought it. Honestly, if you are looking to be motivated, buy this. I’ve never had a personal trainer but I have now. It starts at a good, easy basic level. Unlike the other games where you can just touch a target when you lose your motivation, you have a trainer telling you to punch harder, when to breathe, how to stand etc. I thought their voices might start to irritate me, but found that they are motivating me instead. Of all my fitness games, this one comes out on top by far.  I wholeheartedly recommend it."
1183,Ha-root,"Feb 19, 2022 at 3:16 PM",5,Really good but needs calibration,"It’s a real good workout and I will be keeping it. It Needs some sort of calibration with the targets. I play supernatural and fit xr and I do not have the same issues hitting targets. This Needs some sort of calibration feature/setting. 

Update 2: so, still same issues with the target hitting. It’s a little better. Seems like for the moves you can’t see(t-punches , slams etc ) you need to build up muscle memory.


Im prob the only person to say this. I can’t wait for the subscription version so I can get new content, which will hopefully be new daily like supernatural has. 

Update 3: Yes! The targets have definitely been calibrated. If I miss a target, I now comfortable know it’s my fault. I never had a prob with the knee hitting, but the new system is great!

Just some suggestions  :

1. Make a demo. I had to let my neighbor use my Oculus so he could see how different it was compared to super and fit xr. Not everyone knows or trusts the 2 week Oculus return policy. 

2. Anyway to have an option to turn off that initial loading screen when the trainer comes on and says something motivating. Feels like a waste of time.  

3. Still have to complain about something 😁: Need more content. Even if through subscription. 

I always tell people that when you play this, you can tell it’s made by a company that actually does fitness."

The introduction was well done. I also really like the graphics. There are also more punch variations. Then I started my first session and was disappointed by the poor tracking. I tried many moves and nothing helped. Still, I came in first, which surprised me a lot. Then they must be very bad to others or had similar. 
To rule out it being due to updates in the background, I played BOXVR once right after and played a short session and didn't have one invalid in 384 shots. 
That means for me first wait until the next update and hope that it gets better. So for now no recommendation to my friends who also play BoxVR. I think that's a shame, because this game has a lot of potential."
1188,Sean Mcdirmid,"Feb 7, 2022 at 7:14 AM",3,"A really strong start, but needs polish.","I just bought this a couple of days ago and have used it for two sessions already. Overall, I'm intrigued and won't be returning it. Compared to FitXR, the rhythm boxing is much more technical and precise, which forces more focus on technique but also necessarily limits intensity. However, this might not be a bad thing, and I find my workouts in LES are worthwhile even if they aren't as intense as my FitXR workouts. The more diverse moves (like hammering) are appreciated.

However, LES commits two sins that severely detract from the experience:

1. You can't turn off social! There is no excuse for this, I don't want to compare my score to other people, I don't want other people seeing my score. I almost decided to return the app because of this, but now I just cringe at every workout. This should be optional!

2. You can't turn off commentary. The commentary is kind of useful, so this is less severe than the ""can't turn off social"" problem. Still, I would like the option to turn it off once I've gathered the lessons."

I'm only a week it but - even on low intensity - this is a shockingly great workout. You use your body way more than you do in a lot of other Quest games. (Don't judge me; I have CovidBod.)

My only real complaint is that the tracking is occasionally buggy - as in, the gloves just sort of... float away from me instead of following the movement of my controller. Not sure what that's about."

1193,Badmouth,"Feb 19, 2022 at 1:29 AM",5,Great!,"[Second Update]

Well, I said I'd bump my score up to 5 stars if they let me turn off the social nonsense, so that's what I'm doing. This is now my all-time favourite fitness app in VR. 

It could still do with more classes, obviously, and the vibration feedback could be stronger, but it's a great workout and a LOT of fun. 

Switching to a subscription would still make any cardio game impossible to recommend, though. Cardio's only one side to overall fitness, so the value's just not there compared to more fully-rounded (non-VR) workout options.

[Updated after developer response] 
Okay, post-patch it does indeed seem like a lot of the dodgy hit detection has been fixed. That's great! I'm still looking forward to switching off the irritating distraction of those leaderboards, though. I always seem to find myself either inexplicably rocketing to the top with a commanding lead in the closing stages of a workout, or missing a single move and plummeting just as fast to the lower end. Either way, it kills my concentration.

Even with the minor jank and almost total lack of options, this is far and away the most fun I've had with a fitness game. I won't be buying a subscription when they're offered, since no cardio-only workout game is worth ongoing payments to me, but I'll gladly bump my review score up to 4 stars now in light of the improvement, and will give it the full 5 once I can ditch the obnoxious leaderboard system.

[Original review]
This has the potential to be the best VR fitness app out there, but:

1) Those leaderboards desperately need an option to shut them off. No offence to all you other players out there, but stay the hell out of my make-believe gym! :D

2) As a veteran of BoxVR and FitXR, I have to mention that the hit detection of hooks and uppercuts in this app somehow manages to be even less reliable than either of those at their worst! It's insane how often a fist will fly clean through a target to no effect whatsoever.

3) The ominous threat of a (for me) game-killing subscription model looms large over this thing.

Again, potentially amazing but needs serious work to get there."

1201,Bryan,"Feb 16, 2022 at 11:28 PM",3,Great workouts but that's about it.,"The workouts are great, but I do sometimes feel like the physics are off with the punches, hooks especially. 
Trainers are annoying but then again have you ever met one in real life that wasn't? So maybe that ads to the realism.  It only takes a couple of plays to realize their comments are scripted, redundant and not as individualized as it initially seems.  Music is better than the trainers but I wouldn't call it good.  Workout opens up with you seeing all the other ""students"" or ""competitors "" whatever you want to call them.  Gives you the initial impression that you're working out live with others but you're really not.  That was a disappointing realization. 

But again the workouts are great and theirs a lot to choose from.   I hope the rest of the game catches up to them.

As others has mentioned it can be slow but i think this is where you can focus on adding power.  In harder difficulties the speed will vary between slow and fast.  

App developers could you look into these:

1. Currently i have issues with my left shoulder so i do not want to punch with a lot of power. I wonder if that is the reason why the game is not registering it as a hit. 

2. Also if you could add real time multiplayer.  Currently it looks to be scores saved from other players workouts.

- decent cardio. Doesn't get me racing like TOTF, but keeps me comfortably elevated.

Cons:
- the Leaderboard. Get rid of it, or let us toggle it off. Completely distracting, and makes me lose my immersion in the workout.  I'm not doing this to compete, I'm doing it to better myself.  I'm only interested in beating my own personal bests.  This is the one thing that has to change first, and fast.

- Music and sound quality is lackluster. Just a little too flat.

The gameplay is pretty simple you punch plates in various angles or pull something to your knee while dodging obstacles.

The trainers are funny and motivating. I also learned a lot about how to punch better.
The leaderboard was kinda nice to push myself a bit more.The same applies to the progress bar on the left because it has points that tell you ""here is a lil break"".

~ It would be great if there was a MP option to play against your friends 
~ The knee strikes could use some work; I always nail the left side but miss almost every one on the right 

Some things I would suggest that I haven’t seen in other comments are:
~ An adjustable arm span would be beneficial (the rope punches are way too low if the eye level is set correctly for me, for instance.)
~ A tutorial-only set of classes to learn and perfect moves I’m confused about. I did the tutorials once and could never find them again easily
~ An explanation of how the score works

I am updating review because of admin comment. I found the setting to switch off coach voice, but i had to look for a while, not quite intuitive but worth one more star.

Update 1, I have played a couple of hours more, and one key thing: I am a normal size woman, and the targets where you hit out to the side and also where you hit down, both sides same time, like drums: the are spaced too far out. my arms are too short, I guess this could be the same for smaller men too. I miss them completely, the only way is to chose one side.

update 2: 20 march, one month in, enjoying it but it seems many of the programs have the same songs with the same workout movements, so the programs are just different combinations of a set of music. starting to get boring unfortunately, but the moves are the most varied in any of these games I have played."

---

It could be great.

But the music is not synced to you movements. It's constantly like 200ms (1/16th note) off beat before the movement. It's like the actual point where you're suppose to hit the items is a meter of your center point making it impossible to sync to the music.

So please add a way to offset the music forwards and backwards to be able to get a correct sync. Using standard Quest 2 with build in audio, so no Bluetooth delay here.

Else it's just small annoying things, like i only know my height in cm and weight on kg. No idea what I'm in ft and lb, forcing me to take off my headset and find a converter site.

The third thing is that your actions doesn't reflect the trainers commentary untill the result end. Understand it's way much work, but brakes the immersion and I'm feeling lied too when I performed the worst in my class, and the trainer was ""Awesome! I think you broke the record!"".

Else great visuals. This far 20min on, a lot of different movements, but had to quite because I got frustrated about the timing.

Note: I'm a drummer and extremely sensitive to timing. But I guess everyone that ever played beatsaber can feel the difference too between correct time sync and off by a 16th note (in 120bpm)"

The excitement is there and I enjoy the competition with the other people on the leaderboard - whether they are real or computer generated I have no idea but it's fun.  I hope there is a way to workout with friends like this. It would also be cool to be able to communicate with other people in the workout if they would like to. As for proper form, I am terrible. I can do the upper cuts and that's about it. The jabs when they are quick, I dont seem to be able to get enough power for it to count as hard Strike. The knee jabs are challenging because it's all about timing- which i am still learning. I regularly exercise and when I woke up this morning, I was sore in places I had not been sore in a long time, especially my shoulders. It's a good pain. I am looking forward to the updates and progression of this app and I am confident that it will just keep getting better!
Update***** after a few days of working out, the knee jabs are easy to do now. Again, all about timing. My biggest issue is with the quick jabs, I can't get enough power to make the rings appear. All other hits I seem to be able to.  It's a little disappointing to be at the top of the leaderboard and then 24 quick jabs appear and you are punching as hard as u can and then you start slipping to the bottom. I hope they can work on the sensitivity for those because I literally cannot punch any harder than I am!  I look forward to my workouts with this app and there is so much potential!  I love the environments - it is so fun to be working out in these exotic and exciting places.  I've been to enough boring gyms - this looks much better.  And the coaches- I hope they continue to bring new coaching content because even though it isn't live with the coaches, it does feel like a personal coaching a lot of the time with their comments and encouragement."

If you haven’t done this in real life, this game is a perfect intro to moving well in martial arts inspired ways, and for those of you who have already taken classes in the gym this is such a nice refreshing take on the whole workout! I didn’t expect Dan & Rach to feature so heavily and they bring their unique flavour to it! Well done team! I love it!"
1241,Sascha Sebastian,"Feb 11, 2022 at 11:17 AM",5,No Subscription and a fun Workout,"It’s a really well put together app, that manages to stand out from similar workout apps. The virtual coaches explain the moves really well and they actually managed to implement a lot of work with the legs even though they’re not tracked by the system. 

The best thing about the App is the flat fee. 30 Bucks and you “own” your copy. No subscription. So it’s a 5/5 for now. We’ll have to see how new workouts will be integrated down the line.

One Idea for the future:
Supernatural has an app where you can sync up your Apple Watch to the workout, making stuff like measuring calories way more accurate. I don’t know, how hard that is to implement but it would be cool to have."
1242,Scooley,"Feb 8, 2022 at 7:42 PM",3,Over Hyped,"Reviewers are over hyping this game and I accuse the developer of buying reviews.  My opinion is that this is a bare-bone exercise game that does it’s job but is similar to a workout DVD where there is limited content.  

I praise the developer for making a simple buy once for $30 price instead of pushing for the monthly subscriptions.  For that reason alone I 
will continue to use Les Mills. 

The tracking is not that great, I had a lot of shots that were not registered when I know I made contact.  Only two instructors, little variety to workouts and very little focus on music.

Being able to restart the workout and hide the leaderboard would be nice for an update.

My issue with the leaderboard is the focus on hard strikes, which can lead to injury.  Working out longer and not injuring yourself is better than maxing out to make it to the top of the leaderboard and pulling a muscle from all the force.  Be careful. FitXR has this same issue while Supernatural doesn’t focus on that at all.

If reviewers think Les Mills is better than Supernatural or FitXR they are definitely wrong imo.  Those apps offer way more but the huge strike against them is the subscription.  If everything was the same price it would go: 1 Supernatural, 2 FitXR, 3 Les Mills. 

Les Mills is fine, 3 stars, a good enough workout game without breaking the bank.  I just don’t think it’s all the hype that reviewers are giving it so take that into consideration."
1243,Whoeverx,"Feb 19, 2022 at 5:56 AM",3,First Impressions,"LM Bodycombat WOW very nice App! I've been using Supernatural about 90 percent of the time on my Osculus Quest 2 but really not a big fan of the boxing workout it has, I'm only into the flow workouts. With LM Bodycombat I will definitely be doing some boxing baby!

Second impression. This app just lost 2 stars from my five star first impression rating. It seems the last couple of days it is hard to get on. Sometimes when I do there is nobody there to join so you can't do a thing but exit out. Crazy you can't just go at it alone when this happens, atleast if it is possible I haven't discovered it. On the bright side it made me miss boxing so I tried what works. Supernatural boxing actually seems better for me now. Hopefully the devs work the bugs out but it seems like the game is down for the count and struggling to get back up."

1245,Don Haag,"Feb 22, 2022 at 9:24 PM",4,Great game but does the scoring count?,"I want to give this a 5 star so bad its a great game but after placing first in the ""race point"" I dont see anything where I can check my previous scores or stats.. Am I missing something. Id like to challenge my previous scores"
1246,Joe Amadeus,"Mar 2, 2022 at 3:51 PM",4,Updated: Please See Cons,"I've tried Les Mills about 10+ times. The game is very similar to SupernaturalVR, but features boxing as its primary experience. If you're undecided between this and Supernatural, there are pro's and con's to each of them. In this specific review, I will focus on Les Mills.

Pros:
+ The boxing mechanics are spot on. You'll be doing jabs, hooks, uppercuts, dodges, squats, sky punches, and more.
+ The trainers are live action (and look pretty amazing). I love how they teleport in and out of the room. It's very smooth and fluid. 
+ The trainers talk to you during a workout, which is super engaging. 
+ Online ""ghost"" Players are competing against you, and you can see their scores during your workout. I find it more fun and I get more excited to do better. 
+ The music isn't recognizable to me, but the OST is great! 
+ The game itself is SMOOTH. It loads up quickly. You can get into a game quickly. SupernaturalVR has a long intro screen that you can't skip and it's kind of frustrating and slow. Les Mills is snappy and smooth. 
+ The User Interface is very simple and gives you exactly what you need, right in front of you. The calorie counter is a nice touch. 

Cons:
- The game doesn’t have a settings screen where you can adjust the volume of the music/SFX/voice of the trainers. When I play the game, I usually go into an oculus party with a friend that also owns the game, and we play solo workouts together. I wish we could just lower the in game volume a bit. 
- Some of the workouts on the selection screen are in black and white, while others are in full color. Why is that? I’m not sure what that means. 
- The main workout area has this really weird looking hole at the end of the room. It kind of looks like a crematory. It’s a little unnerving. Can someone fix that and remove that hole? Or maybe put a portal in front of it instead? That hole just looks so ominous and scary. 

I can say that at its current version, the game is well worth the money and it's a polished experience. Highly recommended."
1247,ChinStrap,"Feb 16, 2022 at 10:45 PM",4,Improving,"Edit 2/16: Modifying this to 4 stars. Punches feel better, ability to turn off leaderboard is a plus, but there is still too much of a ceiling on strength to get the max ring. While my issue about timing has been fixed more (able to do 100+ combos easily on high intensity even now), I can still only reliably get the max value if I'm throwing haymakers which is not healthy on my shoulders.  So I can at least get a good workout now by ignoring the fact that I'm missing those.  Still would like an adjuster there though (it is an accessibility thing).  Either auto calibrate it or allow for a manual value setting (look at Thrill of the Fight for a good example)

I'm a subscriber to both Supernatural and the Les Mills standard streaming service. So I know both Bodycombat and VR boxing things well, as well as a veteran of all the big rhythm games both in and out of VR. 

I love a lot of the small details like the shadows on the walls, the knee moves, etc, and it seems like the intensity is good. 

But I can't make it through a single workout because the timing is so off for me. I feel like I have to hit a quarter beat too early to even register as a hit. I've never had this much timing trouble in Supernatural, FitXR, etc.  And I have to hit far harder than Supernatural to get full points on a hit (like unsustainable unhealthy to do too many haymaker punch level of hits). 

Make a calibration session where you punch on the beat as hard as you feel comfortable with and utilize that for both timing offsets and strength limit modifications. And on top of that add options for manual beat offsets and strength limits.  Or fix the timings or make them more generous."
1248,Jul,"Mar 4, 2022 at 10:17 AM",4,Update,"I've been exercising with Les Mills since day 1 of its release!
It's a super workout  , extremely affective ! 
I'm an Olympic Silver Medalist and a World Champion in Water Polo , playing for Greece .

Some of the routines have repeated parts from others , so it feels like you're exercising with the same track and voice over most of the times .
Don't get me wrong here , it's absolutely fantastic , I could never imagine that after 20 years of professional training , something like this would keep me fit . 

One thing only for the Les Mills Team :

Please give us an update! 

Thank you ✌️"

- Feels super responsive
- Great full body workout, inclusion of 'knee hits' (forgot what they call them!) and long hold squats is cool
- Having the instructor there constantly checking in on form is great
- Environments are nice
- UI is clear and concise"
1250,Neonraisin,"Feb 10, 2022 at 10:58 PM",5,The best fitness app I've tried,"And I've tried (and returned) them all, but I love virtually everything about this App.  The settings are fantastical as opposed to the Supernatural type realism.  I love them.  If I want to see nature, I can get in Wander, YouTube VR or Brink.  My favorite part of the workout is the actual workout.  It's fun, soooooo much more fun than Supernatural and no subscription fee.  The trainers are wonderful as well.  I think it might be fun to add a cool sound effect that makes hitting the targets even more fun."
1251,G3Bishop,"Feb 10, 2022 at 11:38 PM",5,Review from a Body Combat Instructor,"As a Body Combat instructor I was thrilled to see this app available on the oculus store, but even more excited by the fact that Dan and Rachael are leading the charge! Together, they bring such energy to the program, which translates perfectly despite some of the limitations of VR. Although the actual group fitness classes offered through Les Mills are far more intense, the essence of Combat is positively represented and reproduced here. I was surprised by the dynamic nature of the workouts which utilize both upper and lower body power and focus - burning calories while building core stability and upper body strength is practically assured. 

I’ve tried just about every fitness app available on the oculus and can say, with all confidence, that this is far-and-away the absolute best! Fair warning: it’s not easy, your strikes must be precise…but with some time and repetition you’ll be fighting like a pro, so just stick with it!   

Kia Kaha!"
1252,William Walker,"Feb 10, 2022 at 4:24 PM",5,Breaking a sweat!,"This app has been on my radar for a while now right from the first time I heard about it possibly coming to the quest, as I use my quest for cardio workouts. It then came back to the forefront of my mind when I saw it had been released. I put it on my wish list and there it say for a few days whilst I toss to and fro whether to buy it or not when I already had the usual suspects of fitxr, thrill of the fit, beat saber, ragna rock etc (never tried supernatural because I don’t want to pay for a subscription for something if I then end up not liking it) well I finally took the plunge today and boy am I glad I did! Anyone who is thinking about getting this and has something like fitxr or supernatural don’t wait just buy it! Fitxr I’m usually 2 intermediate boxing classes in before the sweat drips down my face, this had sweat running down my face after only 2 beginner classes! And I can feel more muscles have been worked than when I use fitxr so this gives more of a workout 💪 I can quite happily say that this app IS my go to cardio app right after the first use! So again if you’re thinking about getting this and like any of the aforementioned apps, just buy it, you won’t regret it!"
1253,Fronkanic,"Feb 11, 2022 at 12:42 AM",5,Ouch,"I haven't been very physically active the past year and figured it was time to try get somewhat fit again. However, I can't stand the gym and I don't dig sports, so I checked the store and found this. While I would like to be able to turn off the trainer's voices, and the knees are bogus, it's still great. Their full body workouts actually left my whole body aching for days, in a good way. This will be great over the coming weeks. Make sure you dress light and open a window, because you are going to sweat!"
1254,Tek,"Feb 10, 2022 at 6:43 AM",5,Overall pretty good,"Suffers from the same tracking issues I had with FitXR.  I can watch my fist go through a target dead center with power and it acts like I barely touched it. Knees are a joke. Sometimes they track sometimes, nope. Overall though a good workout. Feels more like a trainer than fitxr. I do like the way workouts are chained together. I know the beginning g sounded down on it, but it’s a good app and workout. Really dig it."
1255,Kim,"Feb 9, 2022 at 9:21 PM",3,Returned,"Tried it and returning for 2 main reasons, and a few minor ones

1 - leaderboard. Hate it and don't care. Needs an option to opt in or out on this.

2 - coaches. Repetitive audio and doesn't actually respond to my efforts. Feels fake and annoying. Needs option to silence the coaches.

Minor - height issues. Had to tweak myself shorter in the settings. My boundary is set property at floor level.

Overall it's ok and did get me sweating. But there are other non-subscription games that are just as intense and not as annoying.

May look at purchasing again if changes are implemented."

However, its a real shame that once you watch a tutorial, it cannot be replayed.  You may miss something, or have someone else that wants  give it a go, where the tutorial could be needed.  This does need fixed with an uppate.

Also, it would be good if you could have more than one profile on the one headset.  If there is an option, then I am yet to find it?

That said, I think this is groundbreaking, and I am sure any little niggles can be ironed out over time."
1259,CraazedLemming,"Mar 3, 2022 at 12:29 AM",4,Great workout,"I've tried Box VR and FitXR and this is hands down the best workout I've had compared to the others... however, I believe the target accuracy is off.  I have had no issue with the other games as far as hitting the targets.   I've gone entire workouts without missing a target, yet in this when I hit it, it doesn't register.   Even when doing the double punches.  My hands are punching at the same time but it only registers one hit?  That's the most distracting point for me.  I like getting my long combo streaks.  However, that aside, I still get great full body workouts.  

I just wish we could turn off the coaches and make our own music play list, even if it's just with the ones already in the game, like BOX VR allows."
1260,Donna,"Feb 4, 2022 at 3:22 PM",5,Fun workout,So great to have a fitness alternative that is non-subscription. this was a TON of fun (played/worked out far longer than I intended to) and the coaches were great. Music and visuals really put you in the mood and the sweat is real! Highly recommend!
1261,InnovateWorld,"Feb 9, 2022 at 3:37 PM",5,Overall Best Fitness VR App,"Comparisons

-Synth Riders and Audio Trip are more fun but I don't feel like I get a strong full body workout.
-Beat Saber is similar to the above two to me but I enjoy the above two more for exercise.
-Pistol Whip is way less of a full body workout but extremely fun. Some levels do add in more legs and punching but on a per level basis on average there isn't much. I might be able to just manually do more during play.
-VRWorkout has some exercises that can make it the best Fitness App (burpees, jumps, pushups) but it feels like the music isn't in sync with the workout elements and the robotic repeating voice is annoying. 
-FitXR (without the subscription) is very close but needs more squats and dodging added and some additional exercise elements like Les Mills. I didn't enjoy the Dance Exercises and the HIIT exercises seemed a bit odd and annoying. I'll try these more. The coaching during the exercises is pretty useless and feels like a waste.
-Supernatural has the best real-life looking environments (I prefer several of the virtual worlds in other games though but really like these too) but fitness wise I felt FitXR was better on the Boxing style workouts. The Stretch and Meditation exercises I can't recommend paying for. The initial coaching is better than FitXR though. The fact this app is a subscription is a sad one and the fact that subscription price is high is ridiculous. 
-Thrill of the Fight is amazing but likely due to my own fighting style I don't get the best full body workout. I'm not trying to focus on doing squats while battling my enemy. I do get worn out the fastest and sweat the most though. 

Les Mills
-Simply the best overall full body workout. Not by far exercise wise but for the existing quality workouts without a high subscription it easily beats it's fitness focused competitors (Supernatural and FitXR).
-If they could get burpees, pushups, and jumps added like VRWorkout but work well then I think they could by far be the best.
-I somehow missed nearly every knee triangle pull down exercise and can't figure out why. All other exercises elements I hit well. Also, perhaps I haven't gone on to the right level yet but the knee exercises seemed way to long between the time you grab the element until you hit it against your knee. 
-There was one exercise where something was mentioned about hitting like a superhero and I didn't understand how they meant to hit the elements. I might have just missed something here.
-I personally would prefer the option to turn off the trainers from talking during the exercises. I initially thought their constant yapping would be more annoying than it actually was though to me but I would still like to shut them off.
-I'll keep using this app and others and update my reviews over time."
1262,Marius,"Feb 9, 2022 at 5:44 AM",5,"This is really, really, really good!","I'm not generally impressed by fitness apps. Also I think VR is fun, but not to exercise or loose weight. I think other things are usually much more appropriate for workouts, such as running outside, or lifting weights.

BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT!

I was able to swet myself out with other games, like Thrill Of The Fight, or Blaston, or maybe Beat Saber, but BodyCombat is different again.

After 10 minutes of BodyCombat it really feels like a proper workout! I needed 2 days to recover! 

It's fun, energetic, and it's something you're looking forward to doing daily.

The workouts are for everyone, from easy to really hard and exauhsting.

As long as the core remains free (which they say it will remain free), I would be okay with some DLC. I see myself buying some extra stuff in-game. 

What can I say? If you got your Oculus, thinking that you are going to exercise as well, then get BodyCombat, it's definitely something you should try."
1263,Durian Kitty,"Feb 13, 2022 at 8:54 PM",5,I was sweating in minutes!,"Never heard of Les Mills before so was a little hesitant, but the app is wonderful!

Basically, I got out of shape after the continuous lockdowns. Not that I was in great shape before, but I was in better shape.

This app gave me a full body workout (I think, not too familiar with working out). After two short sessions, my legs were trembling and steam was coming off my face.

The instructors seem very welcoming. But they appeared a little small to me. I’m 4’11”, 150cm, and they just seemed like they should be a tad bigger. Maybe they skipped the lockdowns, I don’t know.

Anyway, really impressed with this app. Seems well-made, and I’m excited to keep using it.

The environments are beautiful by the way!

One suggestion would be workouts aimed at women. Long ago in high school, I had to join my schools football team workouts if I wanted to graduate on time. Ended up with a six pack and large arms. Didn’t really suit me. I’d love to be able to simply tone up and lose weight.

Overall, excellent app!"
1264,Wilf T Beige,"Feb 9, 2022 at 5:39 PM",5,Mighty and Addictive,"I don't often do reviews, but here goes. I've tried a few 'fitness' apps, the usual suspects (Beat Saber, Supernatural, etc), but nothing is as good as this. As a (ahem), more mature gentleman, that used to enjoy fitness until a knee replacement, bone-idleness and a wonky back led to several years of inactivity. I thought I'd give it a whirl. Here I am with an inch off my  waist, and feeling better than I have in ages. The workouts are fun, graduated and coached well. They are also easy to follow, addictive and challenging. If you give it a go, and to be honest if you are reading this review you are considering it, you won't be disappointed. It will surprise you and will be money well spent.
P. S. Listen to the tips the coaches give, they really help."

1268,Charmingbutterfly,"Feb 17, 2022 at 6:36 PM",3,More options,"Not sure if I am missing something, but it seems everytime I opened the app to work out its the same old options for workouts.  I have only 4 options on low intensity and maybe 5 or 6 on Med Intensity.  I love the workout, but I am doing the same ones over and over.  I am getting bored with it and don't want to because I love Les Mills workouts.   The songs are unrecognizable, so I kind of tune them out (can't hear them real well over the coaches anyways.   I would like to see more options for workouts, and more songs to choose from.  Unless I am missing something, please let me know, if not then these are my only issues with the app."
1269,RonObvious,"Feb 6, 2022 at 11:35 AM",4,"Great potential, but not quite there yet","I was having difficulty in deciding whether to give this 3 or 4 stars - I think in its current form, it just about scrapes 4. The workouts are good, and have a good balance between arms and legs. I like the style and the trainers - it has much more of a ‘real’ feel about it than other fitness apps I have used. However, it also feels badly finished. There is an issue with the accuracy - I actually found it worse on the uppercuts than the knees. Sometimes your hand just seems to pass straight through the target. I suspect that it’s just a little bit too rigorous in deciding what constitutes a hit. But I also had one workout where the last 5 minutes was all messed up. There was no music, the speech didn’t match what was happening, and only one or two targets appeared every ten seconds. So, there are definite issues. I’m happy to keep it though and hope they fix some of the issues in an update! But I might not cancel my fitxr subscription quite yet."

The targets are clunky and never register center hits, the coaches are unecessary after they explain what you’re doing.

I found it really disappointing and I’m going to return it. You could have a work out get to the end and every single time they would say “Oh you almost made it.” Almost made what???

1275,Sesame,"Feb 8, 2022 at 6:16 PM",5,Revolutionary,"The virtual trainers here are pretty good. Sure, I do wish they could say different stuff every time I do the same session but what they say is pretty good. They keep reminding me to push harder and maintain my posture. For those that complain that hits don't register properly, it's the Quest's crappy tracking, not the game. And, sometimes, it's you. You're just not coordinated, fast and/or precise enough. The point of the app isn't to get the highest score and hit everything. Sure, it's fun if you're number 1. But, this app is about giving your all at every move. I've had personal trainers that helped me lose 20kg and get in shape for Navy SEAL. The sessions they have here are very close to the real thing. At the end of the day, it really just comes down to your determination and attitude every session. Don't make excuses. There's nothing wrong with the game mechanics."
1276,Suougibma,"Feb 8, 2022 at 6:59 PM",5,Great boxing app,"I tried out the main exercise apps in the Occulus store at Christmas and stuck with FitXR o er Supernatural, Holofit, and VZFit. People seemed pretty salty at FitXR for having made purchases and then the platform moved to a subscription model, but i was new so it wasnt an issue for me. FitXR offered to exchange all purchases for the same value of the purchases. I get it, content isn't cheap to make and FitXR does a good job of making new content regularly. I think Les Mills boxing is better than FitXR boxing, though FitXR has other modes. I'm not a fan of FitXR dancing, but I do enjoy HIIT. I think Les Mills moves feel more authentic and the coaching narrative seems to actually match the exercise, whereas the FitXR coachs seem more canned and rarely match the exercise. Les Mills does have limited content when compared to FitXR, but Les Mills is new, so I'll give them time. I hope Les Mills increases content without a subscription or if they decide to go to a subscription model, us early adopters get some special treatment during the transition."

The settings, coaches and workouts are excellent. Music is great and the tracking is 95% spot on. It'd be great if multiplayer classes were brought in, more moves ie the sledgehammer, tire flip and axe chop which could easily be done with current mechanics aswell as outdoor environments introduced. Really great job. Get this if you want to tighten up, lose weight and have fun whilst doing it. Doesn't get boring."

The tutorials are compact but give you the basics to get you in the right stance and technique.  In the workouts the trainers reinforce this while motivating you through varied and fun workouts.  The leaderboard adds some extra motivation to push to the end.  Recorded my highest heart rate ever in one of the workouts.  I’d love to see a warmup and cool down, and hope they will offer more depth on the stats.  Definitely a buy and can’t wait to see more."

I love the extra moves of punching up and down and to the side, the knee strikes, the music seems brilliant and works well with the punches, after a workout I am out of breath and a sweaty mess,  it’s very addictive! I do have a bit of trouble with hitting the targets and I never have this with fitxr, so I don’t think it’s me, but still top stars!"

I’m not able to go to gym sometimes because of work and kids so great to do in the house . The only pitfall is the kids don’t like me stealing the oculus all the time . I did 60 minutes and didn’t even realise and was in agony the next day , very good workout and coaches are great , also loved the surroundings you feel like you are on a luxury gym ."
1281,Quickscope,"Feb 5, 2022 at 7:33 AM",4,Best VR boxing workout next to TOTF.,"I like it, it does boxing better than fitxr and supernatural. It includes the a new kick boxing movement for core that's not used in the other fitness apps. 

Hit detection is a bit off at times when side hammer fists are required for both arms at the same time, and tracking is sometimes lost when in guarding position.

New terms like left combat and right combat position should've just been called orthodox and southpaw.

The scoreboard is great incentive to keep going. I hit a max heart rate of 182 bpm, during my 1 hour workout with it. It's pretty intense. It's one of the best work out apps available on quest now and the best boxing style fitness app next to thrill of the fight."
1282,Mano,"Mar 2, 2022 at 1:46 AM",5,Membership free ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,The reason I just bought this game is because it is the only descent fitness app that works without membership payment. Keep it that way and  a lot of people wil find there way to your app.

This game has improved my memory of bodycombat. It is very easy to understand how to play the game. 
As today is my first day, I didn't want to do a very long game session, but with the tutorial and the 5 minutes of class I have noticed that I have practiced exercise. 
What I liked the most, and what I didn't expect, is that in the sessions there is an online gamification system with other players. 
I won't hesitate to add it to my weekly sports sessions."

1287,Michele,"Feb 7, 2022 at 10:12 PM",5,Great for frustration busting,"I love, love, love this app.  First of all for the price this is great.  It is $29.99 and you get 30 workouts so you are averaging .99 per workout.  The coaches are there through the entire workout and pushing you, encouraging you, teaching you.  It has a great tutorial on stances, punches, etc....if you are someone who has never really done boxing this is very beneficial.  There are different intensities to work toward.  I prefer to stay in one until I get the highest score I can on that one and then move to the next.  You do not have to invite friends to get a leaderboard because there are eight people vying for top score in that particular game (if they are bots, don't tell me different).  The only down side I see is that the plan is to go subscription with this and I feel they would do better if they offered add on packs OR the option to go subscription.  I get that it is a trend and they see how much money other platforms are getting from subscriptions, but please I beg you look at how many people are NOT signing up for those that would still purchase add ons.  You could offer packs with maybe 10-15 workouts and people would jump on those that could not afford to pay a monthly/annual fee (or already have subscriptions to other apps).  Just my two cents.  This is worth the buy and it is a great workout.  You are going to sweat and be sore after doing this."
1288,Melonious Thunk,"Feb 6, 2022 at 7:03 AM",3,"Great promise, but uneven quality now","I wanted to love this, and I'm confident I *will* love it after an update or three.  But for now I'm pretty conflicted :(.

MOST PAINFUL:  
- The timing feels off, even compared to the 4 other Quest rhythm/workout games I've played. Specifically, the LM objects always approach before the beat, so if I hit on the beat it's often registered as a miss.
- As everyone else has mentioned... knee pulls... WTH?!  Even with the advice I read here from others' comments, I still can't get 'em to ""hit"" the majority of the time :(

MODERATELY FRUSTRATING:
- Couldn't figure out a way to see what classes I already took.
- Even trying to navigate (scroll through) the classes felt broken to me.
- Would have appreciated even one alternate set of patter for when I took a class again. For instance, I decided to retake one of the basics classes right after I first took it to see if I could get the hang of the knee pulls, and I heard the same jokes & encouragement from just 4 minutes ago :(.  More broadly, LM, you have an INCREDIBLE opportunity to offer real-time commentary (""that's 3 in a row... awesome!""  ""Hey, careful, don't lean forward on the squats!"")

ON A HAPPIER NOTE:
- Neat backgrounds and slick look overall
- Clear, encouraging trainers
- Really appreciate the varied mechanics!

Anyway, keeping my fingers crossed for the future and will very happily adjust this rating after!"

1293,Matt,"Feb 6, 2022 at 6:51 PM",5,Amazing Workout Program. It’s NOT a game,"All of the other 5 star reviews already covered everything. This is not a happy, cute workout game where the coaches tell you about funny little stores growing up - it’s pure workout-driven action. Straight to the point. 

Question for the Devs, I know that actual knee tracking/detection doesn’t exist, so that tells me that the knee strikes are calculated by the angle that your arms slam forward the intended direction and side of the body that the target knee is on. That being the case, what exactly is the hit box that’s being used? Is it timing both hands at the bottom as the knee target crosses just ahead of the feet? Is it velocity-based?

Also, I’d love to help beta test and help you fine tune this feature as well as other things… how can I reach out to you?  Thanks!"

1295,Stuart,"Feb 6, 2022 at 7:19 PM",5,Best fitness game on the Quest,"As someone who has combined Les Mills on the TV with Boxfit VR for general fitness, I can quite safely say that this mixes both perfectly. The leaderboard being there really motivates me to hit harder, knowing that a missed target can see somebody else move above me instantly and the encouragement from the coaches is also really positive. I find that with a slightly greater variety in exercises over Boxfit VR, you really do get a better all round workout. Well done to the developers of this game and please listen to us and don't go down the subscription route, without keeping enough of the base game varied enough to keep us addicted in the long term! I would far rather pay for add-on packs, if this were an option."
1296,Duane,"Feb 6, 2022 at 1:37 PM",5,Trust the brand!,"Les mills does a great job of bringing something fresh to a well doused market of vr fitness apps, I've tried them all but I knew these guys could pack a punch, yes they have the financial backing and experience behind them but the enthusiasm that they deliver with this app is second to non, I thought the trainers would be annoying but you really feel like they are there with you willing you on, pushing you to the finish line. It's intense and rewarding, something I never got from other apps, some of those felt more of a chore than a workout. I loved the knee smashes, something I've not seen before on vr fitness, listen to the other reviewers and if you're new to this sort of workout you can feel confident that this is the only one you'll need to lay down the cash with.its time for the competitors to step it up as I see no need to go for any other fitness app."
1297,esuki-man,"Feb 6, 2022 at 3:08 PM",5,"Great, but.","I agree that this app is currently one of the best fitness app to play with Quest 2.
But, I want you to fix some points-
1. add some options that disable the menu button. It pauses the game unintentionally.
2. show the title of the session on the progress bar and in the result screen. sometimes I forgot what session I played.
3. manage the session records that I played with a list. I want to know when and how I played the sessions. 
4. let me know where I made a mistake. when I hit a note and get <1000 points, I want to know why I didn't get 1000 points. was it too fast, slow, or inaccurate? since there is no feedback, it is difficult to improve my moves."
1298,Oldman210,"Feb 6, 2022 at 4:01 PM",5,Simply Fanstastic!,"TDLR - Buy it.  You won't regret it; it's seriously that good!

Picked this up based on the amount of Les Mills classes that my wife and I attend at our local gym, and man, we couldn't be happier!  While there may be a few improvements to be made through updates, I can't believe it's this good right out of the box.  It's actually so much more intuitive to participate in a VR Body Combat class than in real life.  You actually have something to aim for when throwing strikes!  My wife and I are both fairly active 50 somethings, and let me tell you, a few 20 minute intermediate workouts really gets the blood pumping!!  All of that being said, I have a few questions / improvement ideas:
1 - How can I track which classes I've completed?  Along those lines, can I see my scores on those classes, so I can track progress?
2 - Any way to get a 'report card' on how I did on a certain class?  Speed, accuracy, etc...That kind of data would be nice
3 - Any way to incorporate biometric data from a Galaxy Watch?  I'd love to be able to see my heart rate while immersed in VR.
4 - Multiplayer.  I know this has been brought up before, but I would LOVE to be able to take the same class with my wife and other family/friends!  I don't necessarily need to 'see' them per se, but being able to talk to each other and offer encouragement during the class would be awesome!!

I know that there are some folks having troubles with knee strikes.  My wife did too.  Couldn't hit more than half, while I was never missing.  She has amazing core strength and coordination, so it was really confusing.  Turned out it was the timing and speed of the strike.  It's not how high your knee gets, it's the speed and timing of the pull down.  Once she found that rhythm, it was super consistent.  At least for us.  YRMV
Anyway, this ended up being a lot longer than I though it was going to be.

Awesome app, and can't wait to see what the updates bring!!"
1299,Kaylee,"Feb 6, 2022 at 9:46 PM",5,This is your sign to buy this game!,"Honestly, this game is WELL worth buying. I absolutely love it. I was hooked after one try. And I find myself ACTUALLY looking forward to my workouts with this app. 

The trainers in this game are great! When you are working out, you really feel like they are there cheering you on and hyping you up. 

The leader board during the workouts are motivating for me to see the scores of people I am competing with. 

They really teach you best techniques for each stance, punch and kick. You do not need to have any prior knowledge to play this game which makes it user friendly to me. 

The workouts are fun, new and they lay out the dashboard well so you can easily navigate to find  the best matching workout you want to try. They vary by time, intensity and so on. 

I leave each workout dripping in sweat and wanting to continue trying more workouts."

I wear a HR monitor and my HR gets up there more than with any other fitness app. I like the variety of punches: high, low, side, jabs, cross, uppercuts, knee strikes because it gets the body moving in other ways than I’m used to and I think of it as active stretching or strength training. I don’t think our bodies are meant to be restricted and if it feels new or awkward maybe that’s a good thing? Love learning combinations and strikes. So fun, can’t wait for more workouts! I like the leaderboard, I’m competitive by nature so it’s a fun incentive. Love the motivation from the coaches. Music is good and flows well with the workouts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9EicbbTbAo

My Initial Impressions:
Having just started back to the gym after COVID 19 I can see myself using this application a lot.
Its very good at motivation and keeping you going.
Also a lot of these techniques are VERY similar to what I use to learn when Kickboxing.
 I also like the varety of moves which makes it a lot more interesting."
1304,Digitalprankster,"Feb 26, 2022 at 6:44 PM",4,Excellent workout!,"I would put this right up there with Supernatural in terms of the workout intensity and motivation factor. The coaches are fantastic and the workouts are intense! I’m always drenched in sweat by the end and feel my heart rate soaring throughout. Some folks may not like the coaches talking all the time, but I love the extra motivation and engagement it provides.

Sadly, I do have a couple of issues that are holding it back from being 5 stars though. The first and most frustrating is that the motion tracking for hitting targets off screen is VERY inconsistent to the point where most of the time, they only register if I’m looking directly at the target. This is doable some of the time, but breaks down with targets that require you to quickly look away (side slams extending both arms, knee slams, and top/bottom/diagonal slams).

The second issue is a minor one, but I wish that there was a way to queue up several shorter workouts into one longer one to create a custom playlist.

Despite those issue, I still wholeheartedly recommend giving this a try! Without a subscription fee, you can get an excellent workout for much less than that other app that starts with an S."
1305,Kaizen Ultra,"Feb 5, 2022 at 10:48 AM",2,"2 Star for now, very very mixed feelings","I would say I put this right in the middle of FitXR and SN, at least both of those never put you in a front stance for boxing. The hitbox to break a target, I would say is pretty bad, It might be that I am just used to SN targets but... for hooks, I'm pretty much having to do haymakers to break the target and that is a no-no for actual boxing, leaving yourself open like that. 

Uppercuts feel super weird, I am expecting that it's because they want you to be in a front stance, they literally tell you in the demo never to do an uppercut or hook in a fighting stance ""orthodox/south stance"". I really don't comprehend why they would be saying this, it's just noooooooo, you are never going to find me in a front stance ever, that is just asking to be hit, nice big target, plus no footwork.  

I went right 3 star workout on the first go, I would say this is more like a medium boxing workout in SN. I get it, the goal is to be heavy punches, full intended, unlike SN where your punches don't really get extended most of the time, especially in PRO. 

The side-to-side movements, slips are just awful, first off the visual doesn't need to be a huge box. This is where SN gets it right, nice thin line, they make it so you can bob and weave. These are meant to be quick and fluid movements, do not feel like that at all, very clunky, and what is up with being able to see my shadow on the slip box? it's not necessary and distracting. 

What I do like about this is the different movements that you do, that is about the only saving grace so far, and honestly, if SN did that it wouldn't be that hard to implement. Then this boxing app is falling hard on its face. 

I like the hand wraps on your hands when you start, and the hand open gloves as well. The trainers are better than the ones on SN, let's face it they are annoying as hell, but I don't need someone in my ear either, this is wher fitXR wins because you can shut off the trainers voice.

I'll keep it because it's different"

Way more down on earth than FitXR. I also liked that somehow liked that one can’t recognize the music with all the positive voice over. In other work out games, my main problem is that I love the music and play too much and soon get tired of the music.

Takes a while to get used to the knees, but that seems to be better a few sessions.

For those having issues installing; just turn your WiFi (in headset) off then back on every time the installation stalls and it’ll continue from where it was until it’s done.

I’ve had a go at the tutorial and an intro workout. I genuinely think this is finally going to be the end of the lockdown belly. Headset on and your in a great nature/sci-fi workout space with a trainer right in front of you, only in VR could you have such a setting.

I saw a few people saying the timing is off for the knee objects - I didn’t experience this issue at all but it did take a couple of goes to get the timing right.

I’m not a subscription person, but I’m interested to see what they do with that, and I’m hoping in time more workouts will be added to the base model or available as add-on bundles.

This is a different kind of workout. I went straight for all the combos in punches, battle ropes and medicine ball slams and I’m whooped after 20 minutes though I’ll continue on.  The only thing I’d say is the tracking to my knees slamming target is off and the only way it would register it is if I actually hit my knees vs striking through (with hands on each side of knee). Unless someone tells me I’m supposed to be doing that but when I’m bringing knees up full force I wouldn’t think so. Maybe it’ll just take more practice. Love it though, and will keep on using!"

1328,Coops,"Feb 4, 2022 at 6:35 PM",5,Amazing,This is such a great app!! I’m a long time Les Mills class attendee but I just could never learn to love Body Combat. This made it so fun you didn’t even realise you were working out! New Combat fan in the house!
1329,Eyvette,"Feb 8, 2022 at 4:44 PM",4,Love love love this game... Except,I used to attend Body Combat classes prior to my gym closing that offered the class. I even provided the DVD set. When I saw it was coming to Oculus I was ecstatic! I love everything about this game with the exception of the knee strikes. I have a SUPER hard time with these. I also wish your previous scores and rankings remained until you beat that score. If these improvements are made I'll change it to a 5.
1330,Hannah,"Feb 8, 2022 at 8:39 AM",4,I have just unsubscribed fit xr,"Literally I have just unsubscribed fit xr after I play this for 30mins. I LOVE IT

But I have just one complaint.

Plz create the multiplay option as I really enjoyed playing fit xr with my sister.

If you can't make the multiplay option, I might have to go back to fit xr later to play it with my sisters and friends"

I love that you get some training and then when it is time to “play” / workout you are given direction and you don’t feel defeated.  I like that for now I don’t need to buy anything extra.  It’s a great addition to my workout schedule

1334,Maki,"Feb 10, 2022 at 7:38 PM",3,"Overall good, but...","I was really happy when i saw that the game was coming to the quest.
Allways enjoyed the bodycombat workout from le mills, but ive never really understood where to go with my hands, now i actully feelt like i understood what i was doing and was feeling the burn thrue my entire body. it was great!

now the bad, the info about a possible subsciption, I seriusly hate subsciption based software, i want to own my software. So please do DLC addons for the main game. so there is an option to those who wants to expand thire game but don't want to do the subsciption"
1335,Zed,"Feb 12, 2022 at 12:51 PM",5,Love it!,The only reason I bought the Oculus was for this and it's brilliant. No sprawling or core for obvious reasons (and sometimes that's not a bad thing!) Great range of intensity and duration which means the whole family can get involved. Just love it!!

multiple classes/ choose friends for class￼"
1337,Minomis,"Feb 6, 2022 at 2:14 AM",4,Awesome but…,"Programmer and Boxing Coach here, let me just say wow… I absolutely love the experience! Workouts are well thought out and aren’t random e.g hooks are often performed after side slips for a natural motion. 

My only issue here is a save bug that I can replicate over and over.

Bug: Intermittently freezes after a workout finishes where the loading splash screen appears, the trigger for this appears to be my internet connection flickering (unstable connection). I assume there is a function that is linked to network process that is causing this.

Device: Quest 2, latest version, 80% storage capacity available. Can replicate on multiple headsets in the house.  

Apart from that, best workout on VR by far! 
Would give 5 starts if it weren’t for the bug causing my records to fail."
1338,Johnny K. Wu,"Feb 23, 2022 at 10:39 PM",1,Some bugs? and subscrpition?,"Update: 2/23 so I tried it again with the latest update, well, now suddently I'm super tall and have to sit down to get the lower end items, and the one that goes right in front of me, I hit it straight on and not recording, like there's no tracking (even though the item breaks apart). The other, while it is a fun excercise, it just getting harder for me :( I've make sure guardian is set right and all, but showing up me super tall and can't get points.

So, just purchased this and did the first level, I did notice many times I would hit the target correct but it's not showing up as a 'real punch' I think there's something wrong, since I tried a few times and hit the target exactly on the center... (ps: I do have martial arts training, and I know I didn't miss but it just didn't register), so what's the distance you supposed to hit it at? tried several point of contact and it just varies.

Also, while I set it up for 5'7"" heights, the hit for to top and sides are further from my arm that I have to move the whole body, with the high hit part I have to jump...

Well, I thought there was an update but it wasn't there for my workout so this stays. Can't give better score yet."
1339,Anarkito,"Feb 3, 2022 at 8:11 PM",5,Really fun to play,The coaches push you really hard and It is one of the best things of the game. I love how they motivate to give my max.
1340,Bella,"Feb 5, 2022 at 9:07 PM",4,Love it but....,"I love everything about it except

- I can't figure out the knees. I'm not getting any points at all. Don't know what I'm doing wrong. 
-I wish there was music I recognized. I love the music on supernatural. 
- some targets I hit directly on are not counting and are showing as ""missed"".

Other than this I really like the environments, the coaches and the work outs and the fact that it's not subscription based."

I got this as a GA from Ohshape January Challenge.
Thanks to Odders."
1346,Joshua,"Feb 20, 2022 at 12:40 AM",4,Some constructive criticism for devs!,"Solid A app, I am SUPER sweaty even after just 1 medium length session!

Here are some critiques that I hope can be taken into consideration:

The biggest thing is how colors of the intensity level look exactly the same. I prefer sorting by length, and right now, all the intensities look almost exactly the same whether it's 1, 2 or 3, the colors are too similar.

There should be a way to adjust volume of trainer vs. volume of music. Unless I can't find right, right now, the trainer is way too loud and I can barely hear the music clearly.


If there isn't, then I feel like there should be a way to customize colors of targets/objects? But this isn't super necessary, just for fun and personalization.

I think the Knee needs to be fine tuned a bit. Right now, it seems like you're holding them for so long before you thrust with your knee, and the timing is not easy to get, and it doesn't really seem to have any physical benefits to hold it for those extra seconds??? In general, Knees need a lot more work I think - the timing right now matters too much and maybe the app should give you partial points if you grab it but dont time the knee right, or if you don't grab it, but make the knee motion successfully after anyway.


The way your stats are shown is not intuitive. The default shows your week, but when you click it, it seems to only show the last week and week before, instead of the current week. Maybe when you click it, it should show the week, then you can press ""back"" to show the past weeks. The current stats should also show which rounds you've done and how many calories you burned for it, instead of just a bar graph that show yours total calories per day."
1347,Dave,"Feb 19, 2022 at 3:06 PM",5,Awesome!!,This is what fitness games should be. Really fun while actually working out with no subscription! Perfect combo. Recommended to all. We played this in a family get together and everyone loved it.
1348,Noturnana,"Feb 18, 2022 at 5:24 AM",4,Finally a one time payment,"Loving this app, great workout if you want to go sweaty. So very thankful it has a one time payment option. Giving a 4 star at moment as I'm hesitant on what will happen once its pushed for subscription. I hope one time payers get add on options vs having to go full subscription. Very happy I found this."
1349,Mel,"Feb 18, 2022 at 6:34 AM",4,I love this but it has some issues,"When you first start you are asked to enter your height, weight, age and gender. You can only enter in kg and m and not lbs and feet and inches. I thought no biggie I will go back and change it..except I cannot find any place to go back and edit this. If anyone knows how please let me know. It is not registering and keeping track of power and data so I cannot see if I am getting better. Also for the life of me I cannot find where to exit the game. I have to push the oculus home button and get out of the game that way. As far as the game it reallly works you out andthe trainer is there the whole time talking. If you want music and little direction this is not the fitness game for you. I personally like the trainer guiding me. The sessions are short but you get a full workout. I also like that this is not a membership excercise program. 
The other issue I am having is stating connected. It will show me offline so I check my connection and it is strong. I went in to another game and had no issues. Then went back into this one and I see the  logo come up and then another logo and I hear beautiful soothing music but nothing but a black screen. I look up and I can see my movement and calorie reminder but the game wont come on even though I hear the music and saw the logos. I keep having to disconnect and go back in several times for it to connect. 
Overall though this is a great workout program if you are looking to actually work out amd not just play or just box. I really enjoyed what I got to play before the connection error."
1350,Riggie,"Feb 18, 2022 at 7:35 AM",4,,"I hate going to the gym and this isn’t the gym..
I can enjoy this 10 minute or 15 minute work out a few times for the day while never having to leave the comfort of my home..
I get these great benefits of a gym with a personal trainer that I’ve been looking for that fits my schedule.. it was great"

1357,Mike,"Feb 11, 2022 at 2:19 AM",5,Best VR exercise app,"I love that Les Mills brought Body Combat to VR.  It's a great app and gets you sweating pretty quick.  Not quite as intense as LM normal Body Combat but it's really good.  Of course, music is great as you would expect from LM."
1358,Kat,"Feb 17, 2022 at 8:22 PM",4,Pretty good but not great…yet,"Been looking for a decent game to get my heart rate up. This one does that. Actually got my legs pretty sore too!  Cons. Only a few workouts.  The knee strike move is really good but looks like they need to make the strike area bigger. because I kept missing 25-30% of them. From the reviews it’s a common problem. The female trainer mentions wanting to eat bread during the workouts. Why?  
It’s definitely a harder workout than Supernatural. Supernatural is more fun and the time goes by faster. I’d be willing to make this app my go to app if they add a lot more workouts and fix the knee strike issue.  I also really like their focus on technique although I wish they would not talk so incessantly. The leader board is okay but I agree with other reviews that we should have the option to remove. I’d love to move it a little further to the right so that I can just focus on my workout. 
All in all a very good app that I have already recommended to friends. 
I see they plan on making it a subscription model. You’ve got a long ways to go before I would consider it subscription level but a great start!
Update: I bought a pair of 1 lb glove weights to mimic the weight of boxing gloves. This has taken the workouts up a few more notches!  I hope they come out with a multiplayer option so that I can match with actual friends versus the game provided avatars. That will increase the fun and intensity."
1359,Jenjen7814,"Feb 4, 2022 at 5:20 PM",5,Wow!,I really like this app!  It really gives you a good workout I knew it would and I was very excited that it was added to VR. Thank you.

Whole body workouts with motivation speaking and it’s easy to start off with I sooooo recommend give it a try !!!!"
1364,Kati,"Feb 16, 2022 at 4:25 PM",4,"GREAT, but with some notes","I started doing exercise with Les Mills Bodycombat last week, combining it with some warm-ups with Beat Saber and Synthrider. And I gotta say I feel like I'm getting a proper bodycombat class each time! My arms were nearly dead after the first time and were very heavy for the next three or four days! :D Very well executed and the trainers are doing a great job. 

However, there are some things preventing me from giving a full 5/5 stars:

- No way to make the app ""yours"". No settings, no personalization (other than just having your profile with height and weight). So, also no way to turn the trainer's voice off while doing the exercise. I'm not TOO bothered about the trainer talking all the time and hearing the same voiceover again and again, but many people would want to at least have the chance to turn their voice off every once in a while.

- No way to skip or return back to the menu once the tutorial has been started. My husband wanted to try this app and as I didn't want his results mixed with mine (he's much more athletic) he created his own profile and was forced to the tutorial. From there, you can ONLY hit pause, or continue. Even closing the app doesn't return you back to the menu, but to continue the tutorial. As he didn't have time to go over the tutorial, he just shut the app and the next time I wanted to play Les Mills, I had to wait for the 5-6 minutes to get over the tutorial."

1375,stacy h,"Feb 16, 2022 at 3:27 PM",3,Not bad but movements are a bit off,"The game is a good work out however it does not always register knees and punches accurately.  If you are just looking for something to do exercise with this is a good way to go but if you are overly competitive then you might get angry when it does not count punches.  There are a few mods I think they need to bring in:
1. Ability to turn off coaches as they are more annoying than helpful with there canned responses and it gets repeative.
2. Private group workout with voice chat - I won't use it but I can see people liking something like that.
3. Solo classes - sometimes having that board over there just discourages completion of workout when you mess up.  
4. Additional Trainers 
5. Different background than just a wall - you change up the outside but then leave the inside just that an inside that is boring."

do yourself a favor    try fitxr
why i gave it 1 star
maybe this game is ok     i didn’t personally like how it operates it just felt wrong 
i gave it only 1 star because people always look at the 5 stars and the 1 stars    this game is probably a bit better than 1 star    maybe 3     it doesn’t compare to fitxr though    me personally   im returning it and sticking with fitxr"

1390,fragments500,"Feb 13, 2022 at 2:11 AM",3,Excellent fitness experience minus rythm,"This game is worth buying right now because it is probably the best fitness experience on the market for VR.

However, as a rythm game enthusiast I have a big issue with having to throw punches slightly off-beat and left without a way to synch audio to time queues appropriately.

Minor issues:
- One of the exercises (knees) are a little buggy. They sometimes disappear.
- Some fitness lessons have very limited space between hooks, which means that if you are above average size you will have problems making the correct movement without the risk of hurting yourself.
- The game is not really multiplayer and the way that the leaderboards work is really iffy. 
- the game needs some more love when it comes to the menu screen—I cannot track my scores very easily or see my latest workouts.

Hopefully the developers fix these issues and it is a clear 5-star experience."

1400,Bananabearenstein,"Feb 10, 2022 at 8:14 PM",4,calibration could be better,It is indeed a full body workout which I enjoy and I'll continue to use as a complementary exercise app.  I do have an issue with calibration and some punches/knee motions not registering even if I have reset my guardian and height etc.  I think it's too strict with hitting the center of the target knowing that there is a lot of inaccuracy with calibration.  A little shift to the side tends to have me readjusting my position more than focus on the oncoming targets.

1409,Jeremy,"Feb 13, 2022 at 5:13 PM",4,It's a hit well most of the time.,"I wasn't sure when I purchased this game whether I'd like it or be able to play it.  Being visually impaired you're at the mercy of UI's and graphical vibrance.  I'm happy to say that the game / workout sections are great and so far I've had no struggles seeing all the icons moving towards you.  I have though at times had difficulty hitting them but I'm thinking that's more me.  I do wish there was a way of making the text a bit bigger in the UI as for me it's slightly too small and hard to read.  It's a shame as options for a larger UI in VR would be awesome and I'm sure technically easy to do.  I agree with others as there are times you want to go back and re watch / do things as it's a lot to take in.  Be nice if there was a refreshers section somehow.   But so far so good and I'd love to work with all devs to make games like this more accessible to those with sight difficulty. :) I have to agree with others who say that everything feels a little too high and you feel shorter than you are.  Please don't go down the road of ""other"" greedy devs who turned their game subscription based.  I don't want to have to abandon another fitness game that I like.  DLC can work fine for those that want more. :)"
1410,PR-IN-VR,"Feb 9, 2022 at 10:31 PM",4,Unleash the inner fighter and get recked,"So I am a couple of workouts in and I’d like to give my current take on the game. Make no mistakes this is a combat focused game and I hope it stays that way. I should clarify when I say combat focused I mean it’s all boxing/martial art related. (No dance moves here)

Pros:

1. Intense level training even for the beginner. You will find yourself pushing harder each go around. The way it should be! 

2. The incorporation of hammer fist, ceiling punches and knee drives creates a unique experience. 

3. Coaches feedback while can get repetitive still acts as a driving force to hit harder, use your core etc. they help create mental cues to help create a better experience. Cheat this game and your really cheating yourself. 

Cons: 

1. So speaking of cheating yourself. I wish this game was able to really focus better on technique. I deliberately wanted to see if this game could or would register bad techniques. It does. I found my self back fisting, slapping, etc. but here’s the deal with this con….. ultimately your cheating yourself if you do this. Like others I’d like to see more accuracy with punch and intensity behind punch but I get it it’s a VR game. This also goes for knee strikes. You can cheat but you wont gain.

2. Not a fan of the leaders board. That should definitely be an option to turn off. I haven’t tried yet but I’d like to be able to play offline. Not sure if it requires internet for the leaders board etc.

Ideas:

One of the things that attracted me to this game was it’s brings a mix martial arts feel! And I Love that!!!!! So to the developers and coaches a huge huge thanks! If I could give some suggestions it would be these.

1. Add the switch knee technique. As the name implies switch the lead leg to the opposite side to deliver a more powerful knee strike.

2. Elbow drag strike. The same way you grab the bot for a knee strike grab and drag to the middle to meet the opposite elbow.

3. Teeps ( push kick) let the focus be on hand placements. This is another one of those you could cheat yourself moments but anyone who is a true fan of MMA especially Muy Thai will appreciate these strikes.

4. Bob and weave. Have a solid bar run through the middle and add hit markers to each side to whatever the coaches decided (jab cross combo, uppercuts, etc). I feel like that will engage the whole body and really kicks the training feel up a notch. 

5. Section to work combos. The same way you would with a real coach.


Can’t wait to see what else you guys have cooking up. And I look forward to kick that 4 star to a 5. 

Keep up the great work guys."
1411,Mark,"Feb 16, 2022 at 4:27 PM",1,Broken!,Not sure what happened. Purchased this game and have been using it on 2 VR headsets then suddenly it has stopped working on both.

1412,Logarhythm,"Feb 10, 2022 at 3:58 PM",5,Great workout,"I've enjoyed boxing and combat games on the Quest for exercise, but this is more like having a personalized trainer guiding you through a real workout that feels like Beat Saber. Love it!"

1415,Simon A,"Feb 8, 2022 at 9:47 PM",4,A pleasant alternative,"For quite a while I was a huge advocate of FitXR. This was my single go to fitness app. As a legacy user, I am fortunate enough to have a large library of workouts but the subscription service still drive me away. 

I have only use Les Mills twice, but the variety is fantastic. Whilst FitXR still has a place, LM feels it will be my new go-to app. I hurt in so many new places. It's going to be fun seeing how this develops.

 1 star dropped because for a new app, it still has some work to go to improve. I just hope they get an active community and listen to input."
1416,Jadesfyre,"Feb 8, 2022 at 10:43 PM",4,Great workout!,"I’ve tried many exercise apps and this is up there with Supernatural.  Three days in and sore.  I loved les mills combat back when I did dvds. It was the workout that was easy to talk myself into.  I’ve only done the first two levels but they are already comparable to the high flow and medium and high boxing in supernatural.  I find I have to give more dynamic movements with my whole body that targets even more muscles.  Therefore a bit more of workout.  I definitely like both for different reasons.
Can’t wait to see what the toughest workout feels like."
1417,Suezie,"Feb 8, 2022 at 2:58 AM",4,Work in progress...,"I think this is an amazingly great app and I love playing. It did have some kind of update today and now my left hand is not registering often when I do hooks and upper cuts. I don't know why it started all of a sudden doing it...the update was the only thing I did different. I haven't changed the room that I'm in or the spot for that matter.  Any suggestions? 

Thanks!!"
1418,AgileGuy,"Feb 8, 2022 at 1:05 AM",4,This is what VR fitness is all about,"If you bought VR as a fitness tool then buy this. I happen to love boxing workouts so it might not be up everyone's street but they are really good workouts and pretty varied. It's accurate and so far,  never boring. You can see who else is in the workout as well ( I think they are real people) so I even have my eye on other people's scores which make me work harder.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed."

1422,Julia Canup Kendrick,"Feb 7, 2022 at 3:19 AM",4,Impressed,"I’ve been working out with another VR app for over a year and this one made me very sore because of some of the new moves. It took me a few classes to figure out some of the moves but after mastering them I loved it. My only complaint (which I’ve also seen form others) is that there is sometimes a timing issue with the targets. I know I’ve hit them but it doesn’t register sometimes. I love the double fist 
punches down and the ones to the sides also. I believe that is what made me sore and worked some muscles that i haven’t been working in the last year. When I finished with my workout session I was drenched in sweat!! I plan on using this app in conjunction with the other one I’ve been using and I love that this one isn’t subscription based!"

1426,Simon,"Feb 6, 2022 at 2:28 AM",4,"Wow, a real workout!","Let's just off the bat say that I've played my fair share of rythm music games. Supposedly some people say that they are ""fitness""oriented if you play Oh shape or Beatsaber on expert to expert+ I don't find that to be the case.

However.... Les Mills body combat, a true exercise oriented game makes you really push yourself with varied and intensive workouts that that actually makes you work up a real sweat and gets you a total body exercise. Not just arms.

I love the instructors constant reminders and moral boost, telling you how you do and about progression and punches left etc. It think that is motivation that is sorely needed in these types of games. And it weirdly makes the experience feel more true to a real exercise at a gym with and instructor. Only this time it's only you and a leaderboard non the side, which btw is a great touch.

Visually good looking, gloves look cool. Good instructions both from video and audible throughout the game and continued in exercises aswell.

I'm going to give this an actual try. And see if it's something that you can get in better shape from

Only thing missing is a European metric system, with kilograms for weight and cm for height input. As a norwegian lbs, and ft are all greek to me so please update that part. And I'll throw on that last star 🌟"
1427,Bert,"Feb 7, 2022 at 2:59 PM",4,Bert,"Couldn’t install the app, but a developer responded to this review and got the ball rolling. I did a factory reset using my phone and I’m now in the process of reinstalling all of my games. To the developer, thanks for your response. So far “support” has not helped me with this issue. Although they have tried helping me with this issue through Email and chat, it seems that the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing in your “support“ staff.  Why doesn’t Oculus have phone support? I mean really, a multibillion dollar company like Meta/Facebook can’t supply phone support. Again, thanks to the developers response it seems that this issue has been resolved."

1432,Belizish,"Feb 8, 2022 at 2:47 AM",2,Missing the Mark,"1) I LOVE Body Combat and purchased this VR version with high hopes. This morning (2/7) worked great then I did an update and this evening everything was off especially the knee strikes. Knee targets were tracking super low and wouldn’t register. I even increased my height to see is that would help but it didn’t.

2) Waiting to be added to the official FB community. Hopefully there will be update information there. This week was supposed to be about Body Combat but I guess I’ll be going back to SuperNatural. 

3) Scrolling is buggy and doesn’t work well.

4) Not sure how to see what exercises you’ve completed and how your current score compares to previous. If that feature is there it’s not intuitive to locate. If that feature does not exist, it should have been an initial release function.

5) No leaderboard function exists except for when you are with an a selected work out.

6) Similar to what others have reported already, the commentary is mediocre. The same commentary can be heard with in different workouts. You could miss multiple targets and be told that you’re doing great.


Not on my recommendation list. Unfortunately, I think I’ve already spent more than two hours using the app so I’m stuck with it 😫"
1433,Tite,"Feb 10, 2022 at 8:12 PM",5,Really good game!,"It's a nice way to get in shape and have fun at the same time! The movements are great and well synced with the music.  Love the coaches quotes, they motivate a lot. 10/10"
1434,morekitsch,"Feb 6, 2022 at 12:01 AM",4,"Excellent workout, and mostly polished.","Its good workout. Heart rate tops iut, sweat happens. The precision of the hit targets is nice to strive for, and the AI can tell when you are floundering about. I really enjoyed the workout. 

I got thei day one and I found it mostly polished. It vrashed a gee and times and the tutorial ials videos cant be replays (i never got very good at the knee-pulldowns, I though maybe i was supposed to stand on one foot and do a sort of crunch thing. Youtube made. It clear that I as silly. Repeating the tutorial ial would have helped). 

Its a 5 for workout quality 4 for the polish, crashes, and lack or tutorial repeats. So treat this as a 4.5 rating.

I hope they add hand tracking. Im sure the controller is used in thr punch force evaluation, but beibg able to do burpie and squats as you can in the sidequest/open-source app VRWorkout would make this unbelievably good.  This mimicks an actual body combat seesion pretty well and adding burpies, pushups and situps would bring it to 100%

Oh, and jumps. We get up from squats, but we arent told to jump. Id pile some.jump options.  Going from a burpie to a jump is usually the sorr of thing that kivks my heat to the mad rate. 

All in all, a great start, and totally ready for daily use."
1435,Caveman,"Feb 6, 2022 at 9:16 AM",4,Very good fit game!!!,"I do some mma myself. I was waiting for a game like this. The boxing ones are cool but this mma style of work out with the vr realm is a good cardio workout. 

I like the boxing stand up combos,  the ducking,  and 
Knees. It gets your heart rate up. You can pick high intensity workouts for 20 mins and up! Other games have like 5 to 10 min workouts which is not realistic for ME!

My only complaint is I couldn't ""favorite"" my fav workout or I couldn't figure it out. The other thing is that the game wouldn't register my knee strikes. In real life I know I am doing them correctly! Lol but in the game it is somewhat quirky to get credit hitting the knees.

Other than that, I love it!!!"

But the developers quickly came back with some feedback and thought it may be an issue with my headset and suggested a factory reset. I did that and it installed fine. If you have the same issue just ensure you save any other game data before you reset. The app is great. I love playing Thrill of the Fight app, but after a while you need some variety, this is a great alternative to mix it up. It gets your heart pumping."

1442,Aarbo,"Feb 4, 2022 at 11:48 PM",4,Not Bad For A Fresh Launch,"I'm new to VR and even newer to fitness at age 36. So far it's making me sweat which is what I paid for. A few suggestions:
1) Add replayable training mode with tips. I can hit all the targets, but the hooks never give me that power ring thingy and I'd like to focus on getting that movement right. It's difficult to nail it down when it comes randomly alongside other targets of different types. 
2) Option to make leaderboards invisible. PVP gives me anxiety and if I wanted anxiety I'd answer a phone call or go to a physical gym. 

As a bonus wish, could hand tracking be made available?"

The punching system is the same as all the others but the knees let it down a lot as most other reviewers have mentioned.. Without the knees its just another fitness app like all the rest.. Ill stick with hiit for a full body workout, who wants to lose motivation in the middle of excercising,"

But…… those knee strikes, maybe it’s just me and my poor timing…. But a longer/better tutorial or full practice workout focussed on them would help. Nothing is more demotivating than connecting with 95% of the punches and then seeing yourself drop down the scoreboard as you miss a bunch of knee strikes ….

(1) ''real-time ranking'' is one of the smart thing, it really inspire me at the moment and try to fight harder to keep my ranking. That is what i didn't felt in the other similar game. 

(2) SUGGESTION: design a ''Target'' session, more focus on certain movement, such as turning waist (slimming body line), squat...etc. (well, think about body pump's content).

(3) the count of hit seems a bit ambiguity?

I can only give you 3 stars, because it is kind of expensive, 
beside the price, I would give you 4-5 stars."

Will give few shots more before i give it 5stars (just because the experience i got from the other app) but for now i can recommend this as the go to fitness app on the quest compared to all other ""games""
If it will get here and there some free and new exercises outside the subs features or one time payment exercises packs this could smash all fit based apps on the meta store."
1473,Petrayovich,"Feb 15, 2022 at 1:51 PM",5,THE BEST but...,Please devs fix the knee pull thing. Never got it to register. OTHER THAN THAT WOW. Get it. Really. Best thing out there

Can't wait for another content, maybe sticks thing?, salam from Indonesia 👋"
1479,Twomuxmelonz,"Feb 26, 2022 at 7:53 AM",5,Great work out!,Fun and engaging! Its more tiring than i thought it could be
1480,Rhodey,"Feb 8, 2022 at 4:03 AM",5,Love It!,I haven’t been motivated to start a workout in over 2 years.  I am on day 4 and enjoying every minute of it.  Highly recommend even for a beginner.

1489,TimmyGreen32,"Feb 5, 2022 at 12:06 AM",5,Wow,I didn't think I'd find anything I liked as much if not more than Supernatural but this is it after only using it one time so far. This is a game changer!

1492,Adventure Kim,"Feb 13, 2022 at 1:14 AM",4,Very good,I found the basic workout to be challenging. One thing that would make this better would be the ability to connect a heart monitor. To be able to check your heat rate while exercising with this would be superb.
1493,Rick,"Feb 4, 2022 at 10:05 AM",5,Great workout!,Great workout and no subscription!
1494,Eric,"Feb 8, 2022 at 5:01 AM",5,Awesome,"First time trying it, it was awesome.  Now when I miss gym days because of being at work I can still get an hour or exercise in!"
1495,Mat,"Feb 8, 2022 at 4:18 PM",5,Greap app ... Just one option missing !,Great app ! Just one thing it would be nice if there was an option to mute the coaches (they are a little too euphoric for me).
1496,esewei,"Feb 8, 2022 at 9:36 PM",5,Berry nice!,Just purchased and did one of the harder workouts. Very easy to understand and it was a great workout. Definitely recommend.

1508,KG,"Mar 10, 2022 at 12:25 PM",4,Knee,What's with the knee? It too difficult to hit and demoralizing.

1512,kaja,"Feb 11, 2022 at 3:48 PM",4,Great game but,This is a great fitness game but the scoring makes no sense my friend a d I both did Box Fit Hype I got a better score and full Combo yet my friend got a bronze medal and I didn't why is that.
1513,Chrissyjustme,"Feb 5, 2022 at 7:52 AM",1,Pretty disappointed,"I hit every single knee strike and it didn't register a single one, might be refunding because it's not what I expected... also should allow for another person to be on the game, and you should be able to go through the tutorial again"
1514,prwashbu,"Feb 5, 2022 at 4:53 AM",4,"Great game, couple minor flaws.","It's a great VR boxing sim and the knee strikes are an interesting touch I haven't seen in other games. 

My only complaints: 
- No way to turn off the trainer
- No way to skip the tutorial.
- No way to do a solo session."
1515,GiGiking,"Feb 22, 2022 at 11:21 PM",5,Fantastic game!,A lot of fun and great exercise

1517,Giraube,"Mar 3, 2022 at 6:11 PM",4,Got fast help with an issue,"Now the app runs and does a really good job. Would wish, there would be more content for dummies, then I would rate 5 stars"
1518,Ivan,"Feb 16, 2022 at 4:21 PM",3,Good app,The app in general is good I am sweating alot from it. But I wonder is there any chance I can stop those motivation talks it's so annoying and it makes me feel uncomfortable
1519,Shannon,"Feb 8, 2022 at 7:54 AM",4,,I workout with this and fit xr. Wish this would have multiplayers so we could challenge friends and see them and chat like fit xr. But I do enjoy all the squats and and dodging walls. Good leg workout
1520,LaPat,"Feb 14, 2022 at 5:25 PM",3,I like it but would love it,"I would love this game if I could play with my friends, I like to challenge my friends . I see other people on line but it kind of sucks that my friends can’t be on the same game"

1526,Addoza,"Feb 24, 2022 at 11:43 PM",4,Great but,"Love almost everything except for the knee move, it never worked for me (been doing combat for over 10 years)"
1527,Bossbeast,"Feb 9, 2022 at 1:01 AM",4,Needs a bit of work,Hit detection is a bit suspect at times but overall a good VR representation of the LM body combat classes
1528,GreasyTopLip,"Feb 18, 2022 at 4:28 PM",4,Great fitness game....BUT...,"Great work out be we need a way of tracking previous work outs completed.

1533,Maz0ren,"Feb 6, 2022 at 3:44 PM",5,Just buy it!,"By far the best fitness app available,  could not reccomend it higher. You will SWEAT!"
1534,jkelly1296,"Feb 10, 2022 at 2:51 AM",3,"Fun game, but too expensive","I really enjoyed the game, but for the price the creaters need to add more challengesto extend the game so that the game doesn't end so quickly. The last room was a little too easy."
1535,Iamstonge,"Feb 4, 2022 at 11:54 PM",5,Great workout software,"I really recommend it. Very easy to use, well explained and workouts make you sweat. Love it!"
1536,Mercedes,"Feb 13, 2022 at 10:28 PM",4,Awesome workout!,"I love this workout! I would love it more If the knees always registered! The window to hit is so small, it’s easy to miss and is so inconsistent."
