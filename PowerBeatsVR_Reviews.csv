0,Jester,Mar 2 at 9:03 PM,5,Better than the rest.,"This game has got some bad YouTube reviews, they say that it is not polished,the music sucks and so on. And they're right but it's still better than the other  exercise game to me. I played supernatural before and I bought fit XR and used that for awhile but I think  powerbeats is better. Because the music isn't great I tend to tune it out and don't try to play by the beat of the song.  When I play fitxr when I'm done my arms and upper body is kind of sore. When I play power beats my entire upper body hips and my legs are sore and shaky. This game will really make you Dodge duck and squat. I've had this game for over 6 months I have no regrets.üëçüëç
Oh and I haven't even tried putting my own music or making custom tracks yet.
Update 3/2/23.   Another thing I really like is you can change things up easily. don't want the streams: remove them. Want to make it a little harder: change the ball size to small. Want to really have to squat: on the main screen reduce your height. ( I'm 5'11"" changed to 5'6""). Want to really work your shoulders: increase your height by 7in and now you have to punch up over your head. Add  1 pound wrist weights and you arms will be screaming.üòÅ"
1,DoveLori01,Feb 13 at 5:32 PM,5,Fantastic way to sweat!!!!,"First I want to say- you don‚Äôt need a grid to play this. I set my oculus on stationary boundary (the blue circle) and this game is freaking awesome. 

I don‚Äôt have enough room to play safely with a grid  due to your head unit might be in vr land but when swinging, your arms can be outside of that grid at any given time and I dont have the need to be injuring anything whether it‚Äôs my body or object broken. 

Now I love punching and I do uppercuts and jabs and such. Than I mix it up with round house punches üòä I am so glad I can punch with either hand that it‚Äôs not colored to one hand alone. So you can do as you please and get a good sweat on. 

Some songs aren‚Äôt for beginners, you are warned üòÇ I played the one and not paying attention and I had tunnels to duck into! And that was very kool but way to fast from tunnel to boulders and spikes so. I am a beginner since I purchased this last night and had a blast üí• üòè with it. 
I love that the boulders are at different heights and you can really work your core depending how you hit and than the streams of lights come to relax for a few seconds. 
The game has very encouraging words and it makes me want to do more and more. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I eat that up, boosts my ego. So for that awesome job creators!!!!! It‚Äôs nice to stroke our egos. 
I love the scenery- I looked around and behind me is something I absolutely find fascinating and that‚Äôs Egyptian time üòä ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 

Very kool game, thank you for creating a game that if you are frustrated and want to punch and to see that object explode into fragments, than this is a game for you.  You are ant something that doesn‚Äôt have colors for both hands, this is for you. If you want something to just see if your reaction time is fine or excellent than please by all means since some of the boulders are high and you need two fists and angle a bit  I was good at beginner but when I selected a song and when I paused to come out, it was advanced mode üòÇ too fast for me so I know I need to focus on beginner level and than move up once I play all the songs. 

Btw the songs that are in this are pretty good so far. You can bring your own music into this mix but I will wait till I played the music that comes with this first üòä 

All around a nice retreat and get some exercise while letting go of tention that‚Äôs with in. 

Again great job creators!!!! So glad I got this game and for those reading reviews and see ppl griping- please don‚Äôt pay attention to them. I went into this game for an experience and to my surprise I love punching boulders even though they are vr boulders but yeah love it!!!!!!! 

I put the code for percentage off on the Facebook page. I did pay the full price, it‚Äôs worth it

ENJOY"
2,Tammy Baldasaro,21 days ago,5,Don‚Äôt underestimate PowerBeats VR!,"You CANNOT cheat the squats and lunges in this game and that is exactly what I needed. 
I hesitantly purchased this fitness game when it was in the App Lab, and have no regrets !!  
My hesitation was due to the song library being unfamiliar and smaller compared to other fitness games. 
When I started playing, the benefits of the exercise was much more Important. 
I have been playing Supernatural regularly for about 2 1/2years and I can tell you that this gets my heart rate into my optimal zone much quicker. It‚Äôs a straight up legit workout. 
Sure , I wish the music library was larger but for a newer fitness game - it‚Äôs not to be underestimated and I know these guys are working hard to improve and add more to it.  
I genuinely love it. 
Fires up those abs and glutes for sure !! üî•üî•üî•"
3,Killer Scene,19 days ago,5,Impressive custom track generation,"I have many rhythm/workout games on the Quest now.
Visually, most are a bit better polished. Most probably have a bit more variety in the movements. That said, those are very minor criticisms, which will probably be refined over time.
What is truly astounding about this game is how good it is at generating routines out of custom tracks. I mean, it sounded like a cool feature, and then I tried it... It flawlessly made routines out of every track I threw at it, with each being unique and fitting to the song, and it did it in literally seconds, with an incredibly easy process. Conceded, I stuck to songs with a good beat, but I was blown away at how much it exceeded my expectations at the task.
It's also a great non subscription workout. This and Les Mills have by far the best cardio.

Improvements I'd like to see:
Alternative visual styles for the things you hit. I like a bit more contrast, so an option a bit more colourful and illustrative style as per many other rhythm games would be cool.
Better rails. Both the way they move, the look, and the feedback you get from them is a bit underwhelming (I just switch them off for my custom tracks).

In summary, it deserves 5 stars just on the strength of the custom track generation."
4,Saraph,Feb 12 at 10:36 AM,4,Best app for your own taste of music.,My favorite part of this app is the ability to use my own music without the need of a third party to make a map for the music to workout to. It automatically does it for you or if you want to do it yourself you can within the app make your own map or fix the map it has made for you. NO need to have a PC to make a map and then download it to the headset. Also it has the feature to put in your own workout environment if you want to. This game is fully  customizable.  I own other well known workout apps and they all lack in the area of using your own music  right away. Simply download the music through the browser in your headset and you are good to go. ** Tip- put your music on a cloud based storage and log in then download. That's it.

Since I purchased PowerBeatsVR, I have been using it everyday. I like the music that is already in it. The workouts are really fun and effective and I don't feel like it is a chore. Just a few songs in and I am sweating. After 20 minutes, I'm already beat but in a good way. Most of these types of rhythm workout games are mostly hand movements but PowerBeats has me squatting, punching and occasionally jumping. It's everything I want in a music workout."

7,Steven Kazanow,Mar 10 at 4:54 AM,5,A fun workout,"Not unlike Beatsaber, but being able to easily use any song you choose without extra charge makes all the difference. Like that you can customize the workouts in just about every way. With emphasis being on exercise and not as much on gameplay, it really keeps you moving while being more forgiving of game rules (no right hand/ left hand restrictions, you are not anchored to directional arrows, etc). Beatsaber is a more sophisticated and challenging game for sure. But as a painless fun workout Powerbeats is better. A onetime charge and no subscription fees too. I did spend the extra couple bucks to play with the customization add on, but it cost less than one song purchase in Beatsaber and you can still synch up you‚Äôre own music without it."
8,Yomgal,11 days ago,5,Buy the game and thank me later,"I don't think people understand the full potential of this game. When I learned that I can easily add my own music tracks just by dropping MP3s into my Quest - and the game will instantly generate a workout out of them - I was sold. But then I saw that it also had an in-game map editor where I can create and fine-tune the workouts. PowerBeatsVR is miles ahead of the competition.

(P.S. I've posted video of a beginning of a custom workout here: https://hachyderm.io/@ygalanter/110131884343512897)"

12,Bladerah,Mar 9 at 7:27 PM,5,Top Fitness Game,"This is the top fitness game now. You can put your own songs on it. It‚Äôs very easy and turns this game into an exponentially better one. The game will auto generate a stage for you or you can make one in the game itself. The movement this game requires forces you to use your entire body. It also has a playlist option that will play songs back to back with an option to infinitely loop them. The songs on the playlist don‚Äôt take time to load between songs as well. It keeps track of calories burned and the number of squats you did. I hit my move goal calorie target on this a full 15 minutes or more sooner than I do on beat saber or synth riders:


One potential addition I‚Äôd ask for is a maybe a 360 
mode or something but that may be overkill.

Just buy it."

14,Metan,23 days ago,5,Good game and workout,"This game is definitely a good workout and the gameplay is solid.
I only tried the most advanced difficulty and I like that it asks for more reflex, whole body movements than other rythmiques games.
I played every other rythmiques games on oculus and this is my current favorite (played too much beatsaber).
I like the musics and love the fact that we can import new one (for free, made by ourself or others).

I do have complaints though :
- graphics are fine but game with simpler graphics like beatsaber, pistol whip, superhot, feel more polished.
- most playing modes needs to be unlocked, and this unlocking take too much time (for this kind of game I like too have everything fast)
- the farther we look the blurrier it gets (same for every games, but, for rythmiques games, this one is where I found it the most noticeable)
- since we move a lot, the lenses tends to get foggy and the headset tends to move from its sweetspot, making it even blurrier (this one isn't the dev fault but it's still a minus)

edit : some skybox in the extension pack are really nice to look at. It has the potential to become really gorgeous with the quest 3 (if they update for it once it's released)."
15,Mark Wants a healthy women,Mar 2 at 4:18 AM,5,Love it,"I used the try before you buy free trial and I‚Äôm glad I did because it‚Äôs great. I used to try synth riders, audio shield, beat saber, etc. and I liked most of them, but this game gives me a good workout. The workout in this game is better than synth riders. Ôøº it‚Äôs very fast and intense, and I love it. The price is reasonable, the graphics are great, the gameplay is excellent and I highly recommend it. A+++Ôøº"
16,Christian Robert Schulz,6 days ago,2,Stupid decisions,"The developers have made some strange decisions. Because in this fitness app, the different exercises are not immediately available. Instead, you have to start with the boring boxing exercises, and unlock the other (maybe better?) exercises later. However, this is not done immediately, but laboriously, and for this you have to do the crappy boxing exercises for what feels like hours. What is this crap? To make matters worse, the developers place the feedback form for new users (!) directly in the middle, so that you can't help but open it. I haven't seen this kind of crap in a long time. It's a real shame that an app with potential is ruined by such stupid decisions!"
17,Johan Smedberg,17 days ago,4,Not bad at all!,"Wow, this Will be the perfect training companion! And the possibiliry to add your own MP3‚Äôs makes it great!

23,Mom is that you,Feb 27 at 12:07 AM,4,Worth the $$,"This game is pretty good 
The only thing it‚Äôs lacking in, is good music. Although they have a feature to add your own music, which I haven‚Äôt tried yet.  I know they can‚Äôt use copyright music, but the song they have in the trailer for this app, is good!!! (It‚Äôs just some random beat) but I like it a lot.  Doesn‚Äôt need to be fancy, just have a good beat. Unfortunately that song that they‚Äôre working out to in the trailer, is not available in this app, and none of the music sounds even close to that.  So that‚Äôs why I gave 4 stars.  Other than the music, it‚Äôs a fun VR fitness app.  Cool scenes, and fun tools to use to hit objects. I love all the tunnels and ducking and dodging this game has you doing. 
Your hitting fast orbs and fire balls. You can be on land or in outer space.  It‚Äôs really fun, and I find myself coming back to this game, much more often than I do my Supernatural app.  I‚Äôve got that one also.  But I like this one, and would recommend you give it a try!"
24,Denise Machen-Anthony,Feb 18 at 8:03 PM,5,Great Workout,I just finished an hour workout and this it was amazing. It really gets your blood pumping and sweat dripping.

I highly recommend this game.

29,MikeRockford,Jan 14 at 8:49 PM,1,not on beat at all! OUT OF SYNC w/ music,"This game was a disaster.  I honestly don't even know how PowerBeatsVR was released, it's so filled with glitches and fundamental errors in gameplay.  Striking the targets simply DID NOT line up with the beats from the music!  The audio playing was completely out-of-sync with the explosions from the video.  It's almost as if whoever made this game doesn't understand what beats and rhythm are, or have any grasp on the concept of music theory and time-signatures.  I compare this giant failure of a game with something like BeatSaber or Supernatural and with THOSE games, the explosions & target-strikes line up PRECISELY with the music beats.  Not the case with PowerBeatsVR!  I'm asking for a refund for this frustrating broken mess of a game.  FAIL!!!"

36,Demeus,Dec 17 at 1:43 AM,3,"Good, but lack of polish","I have been using this app regularly for a few months now. It is not revolutionary by any means and is obviously not as gamy as beat saber but the fact that you can use your own music and that it doesn't require any subscription makes it stand out among other fitness apps on the quest. Contrary to many other games that makes you move and sweat, this really feels like a good workout. 

However, it very much lacks polish. The textures are downright ugly, the hit detection is not very precise, and the automatic generation, as impressive as it is the first time, can get very hit or miss. Also, the exercise loop is always the same and can get stale after a while. 

Still, if you want a fitness on the quest when you can put your own music, this will probably do the job."

38,Rob,Dec 25 at 5:21 AM,4,This app COMPLIMENTS my daily routine,"I‚Äôve used this app for over 20 hours and I‚Äôm currently at level 22. I luv it now that I‚Äôve installed the custom skybox environments as I now have 30 environments in total, and I change the environment each time when selecting the next song on my list. The custom upload of songs is the best feature. I‚Äôve uploaded 200 of my fav songs. Combining these with the custom environments gives this app enough variation to make the repetitious boxing bearable each day. 
 
The devs have a song editor, but the issue I find is that it‚Äôs too low level, inserting walls or tunnels etc on individual beats. It‚Äôs doable, but very time consuming. Something you‚Äôd do for your one favorite song, not 200 songs. The devs have then added an additional feature that allows you to edit based on your movements, but I personally didn‚Äôt find this any better than the original edit feature. I think the underlying issue of the app is that it doesn‚Äôt contain enough different medium level patterns that can be randomly played. There appears to be only a couple of handfuls of distinct objects and patterns.

Repetitious boxing is the weak link of the game. So I recommend anyone buying the game to just skip playing the included songs, and play your own songs for just less than 2 hours. Then make a decision if it‚Äôs too repetitious. If so, hit the ‚Äòrefund‚Äô button. But I find it Ok, only because I play just 30 minute max per session AND then complete/compliment it with a non repetitious app like Dance Central by Harmonix (which has literally hundreds of different aerobic like moves using your arms and/or legs). I don't think I would use this app just by itself."

It just works. Smooth and elegant with all the bells and whistles you would want. Plenty of settings, calorie tracking, playlists and you can even import your own music if you want and the editor for making your own fitboxing workout to your own tunes is very easy and a delight to work with. You just play your imported song, boxing along how you like and the editor takes note of your movements and does all the mapping for you. Simple way to create your own custom mapped workout tunes. Not that you really need it, since it comes with a nice variety of tunes to work out to already.

57,KbytesofJax,Oct 22 at 10:51 PM,5,Very Versatile,"This is one of my favoirite workout games.  It can be adjusted to do what you want to do.  In my case, I wanted squats to maintain flexibility.  I can change the workouts to have more or less squats and eliminate the back and forth steps as I don't have a large amount of room.  It is also fairly easy to add songs and create your own workouts with them.  My playlists have been created as short ones to fit into break times or longer for when I have more time.  Hope you enjoy this as much as I do."

63,Savonna,Aug 31 at 4:12 PM,5,This is for me,"The best workout game I've played so far. I like how things look solid and not neon and see through. Good music to start and I finally figured out how to add my own music. You can play with or without bombs, vertical and horizontal walls, tunnels, power balls and streams. There is beginner, advanced and ""oh my heavens!"" pro. I keep trying other physical games to add to my workout but this is the one that really gets me in the mood to do a real workout. I only wish it was hand tracking added so I could put down the controls. I use this 5 or more times a week and it's made a huge difference in my moods and muscles. This should be in the top games in the Oculus store. It would surely be one of their top sellers. No subscription!! Put your music in and take it out. Change it up. Best fitness game."

66,Mike,Jul 30 at 9:37 PM,5,Great workout game without subscription,"The trend of monthly subscription workout games made finding something other than beat saber a challenge. The main issue there being paying for music packs to keep it fresh.

I bought powerbeats and thought adding songs without a pc would need technical wizardry, I've been amazed!!

The existing workouts are good but in about 30 minutes I had doubled the song library from right there in the headset.

Workouts created within seconds and back to that "" just one more"" feeling.

I find music is a big element to motivation and  have enjoyed creating a playlist similar to loading my iPod when I used to go to the gym. 


Mechanics are an excellent mixture of synth riders, beat saber and box vr elements that isn't made too complicated to pick up but challenging enough when you raise the level

The environments are nicely done and I like the idea of unlockables.

I can't rate the game highly enough. Giving players limitless options to get fit rather than a money grab.

Fingers crossed for multiplayer in the future."
67,Pierre,Oct 9 at 5:48 PM,5,Excellent Active Game,This game is high quality. It gives me more of a full body work-out compared to beat saber. The modes are completely customizable and it is so easy to integrate your own songs. The game boasts the ability to create new maps within seconds based on any supplied track. This game is still being updated. I would highly recommend this game to people looking to step up their Oculus work-outs.
68,Brandy,Feb 17 at 4:33 AM,5,Love it,"It was so much fun, and it was definitely a good workout!"
69,Telstar,Sep 2 at 8:44 AM,3,Environment execution needs improvement,"Love the core game play loop of this app, and the workouts really get my blood pumping - no complaints there. Also love the ability to customize the music and environments. 

What I don't like is the visual fidelity of the panoramic images. Tried uploading panoramic images of several different resolutions and they all look terrible. Even the included panoramas looked awful once I realized what I was looking at.

It's like the environments are being massively scaled down in resolution and then massively blown up, which makes everything in the image look huge and crude. Details aren't there, and the objects in each panorama look far larger, distorted, and less detailed than they would irl. Hard to describe exactly, but it's like looking at the output of a super low res projector from the 1990s that's being used to throw a 300 inch image.

Not sure what the problem is, but since this is just a static background image I find it really hard to believe the environments look this bad for performance reasons. If they clean this up and publish recommended dimensions h x v x dpi so that users can get consistent environment quality this app would be a winner. 

As it currently is, I like the app but wouldn't consider it to be worth full price by any stretch of the imagination."
70,Raging Hamstr,Feb 18 at 7:47 PM,5,Wow,"Good by supernatural, Hello power beats!!!!!"
71,Jacek,Aug 21 at 1:58 PM,4,good workout but not polished,"Actually this is a good workout game. It combines music games like Audio Trip or Synth Riders with boxing games like FitXr or Thrill of the Fight. It makes you sweet and you can see kcal burning in Oculus Move.

I like that this game measures how hard you hit something, so there is a reason to play more and reach higher score.

I think the main thing to fix in this game is feedback when you hit things. I don't feel like I am punching something. I feel like I am hitting thin air, which is true, but in boxing games my feeling is better, so I think sound plus vibrations are important and this is a place to improve somehow. Also the sound of rails (coins) is very lame to me, it's even destroys good music in the background.

Visuals are quite crude when you compare to other games, I think maybe lighting/shading is missing in environment and walls (targets look great), but this is not very important issue.

I recommend you this game if you want another workout game which is not same as other. I hope game is still in development so we will see more updates soon."
72,Sang,Oct 14 at 2:46 AM,5,Love the new add on custom environment,I hope you guy will increase more custom environment add on for us to buy in the future. Keep up the good work
73,Trancemuter,Aug 2 at 10:15 PM,5,this is the one!,"After I figured out how to load my own tracks into the app I have to say that this one fixes all the issues I had with any other musical workout apps out there, I can finally work out to the music I like and not forced to listen to cheesy commercial music or pay extra for more cheesy commercial music that was such a turndown I could not force myself to tolerate them. Finally I cam work out to psytrance! lol this is a godsent. thank you for saving me from tasteless music forced on me!

Wishlist:
* More variety, exercise types, movements
* Better and more immersive graphics
* Fitbit integration
* More goals and gamification
* Seems like targets are not adjusted to what mode you are using. Would prefer Hammer mode to be more of a BeatSaber-like experience for example, but this mode just makes it easier to cheese targets you should be reaching for."

79,JandJThomas,Jul 24 at 4:31 AM,5,"Nice, customizable workout app!","I've been looking at various workout apps for the Oculus. I've tried a couple of subscription-based ones that I liked, but were expensive, with yearly charges much higher than most games. I like to own my apps, paying for them just once. I did some on-line searching for workout apps, and saw a video that showed several, including this one. I watched another video, and decided this would be great for the price of under $25. I had to go through the App Lab to get it, but found it was on sale. Under $15! I immediately purchased it, downloaded it, and tried it on my headset. I found it easy to start using it at a workout level appropriate to my fitness level and did two workouts. My husband tried it as well, and he went through three workouts in a row. I like that there are short workouts that I can do as a warm-up to non-VR exercise or I can stack for a VR-only workout."
80,Q.E.D.,Jun 27 at 3:12 AM,5,Love Working Out To Disco and New Wave,"This may be an app labs game but I found it ready for prime time. Feels polished, smooth and complete. I hope it gets wider exposure and added to the main store: the devs deserve success and accolades for this excellent & fun workout app.

What sold me initially was the ability to add songs from my own library. I love disco, '80s new wave, EDM. Add oldies to new stuff - Bee Gees to Post Malone...whatever you want!  The app matches the song's beats per minute to create the workout routine. You can also add/remove/tweak what targets are thrown at you and how fast they come at you. So far I've unlocked the Hammer, so can use fists or the Hammer in game play. Try to beat your high score or achieve a perfect score.  Progress to higher levels above beginner and it feels like going into cardiac arrest but in a good fun workout way.  I haven't played Beat Saber since I became addicted to this app. I'm using it for about 30 min to work up a sweat, loosen up, then I do strength training on my Total Gym. Perfect combo!

Worth every penny. The value is amazing!"
81,Nyquist,Jul 27 at 1:00 AM,5,Great Workout,"They took the best of several fitness apps and merged them together.  You will sweat, your legs will be sore, and your arms will get tired.  You have to punch/swing, dodge side to side, and do many squats.  It is almost as fun as beat saber and light years better than Box VR.  The custom map generator is really impressive.  You get a ton of customization options to make it exactly the way you want it."
82,Bandita,Sep 8 at 8:12 PM,4,,Have had this app for a long while and love it. I would happily buy dlcs with music and new scenes. I dont own music nor any desire to purchase any so no way to make my own playlists.
83,KARNNEY,Jul 26 at 1:01 AM,5,Love working out to my own music!,"So much customization, using my own MP3s, creating my own maping, generating workouts automatically with custom parameters. I sweat and I love it.  It's aerobic and impressive especially for a single purchase app they keep adding features to.

The feature I'd like to see is an option to play each song starting in a random environment (like during playlists) and even maybe random map generation on each song load.

I've been loving it for months. It doesnt get boring because I can just add new songs without paying extra and make new maps. Creativity isnt locked behind a paywall."
84,T,Jul 24 at 10:41 PM,5,Good app!,Really good app- kinda like supernatural but without the subscription. Love I can choose my own music. Only critiques are it being kinda tricky to pause/exit during a song and wouldn‚Äôt mind the option to add a little guidance on which direction/type of punches to throw- other than that it‚Äôs a great game/workout.
85,Nah,Jul 15 at 9:25 AM,5,One of the best fitness apps.,"I‚Äôve tried a bunch of fitness apps out and this is for sure one of the best value ones on the quest. Lots of options for customization, solid high intensity workouts, and you can even load in your own songs which makes it even more fun."
86,Nick,Oct 23 at 6:31 PM,5,"Great game, even better price!","My wife and I were looking for a workout game and was thinking about Les Mills but went with this instead being as it was 39% off. Was looking for something to make us sweat and this game definitely does what we were looking for! The fact you can add your own music and it auto generates the level (you can also edit it) makes it a must buy if you're looking for a fun workout. My only thing is that there could be more environments and the option to use hand tracking would be nice. Overall a great workout! 
Update: you can get 8 more environments and the ability to add your own panoramas for your own environments for like 2 dollars or something like that. My only thing is that the calories burnt doesn't quite match up to what move counts, the calorie count in game is a little higher than what move measures but I use them both for comparison anyway!  Also if you wanna get 25% off, screenshot my review and copy and paste the text into your browser!üòÅ Happy questing, guys!

87,darkshadowlass,"May 23, 2022 at 5:58 PM",5,Sweatin to Slayer,"I wasn't sure if buying the Oculus Quest was something I would throw aside and never use. I found this app and to me it made the purchase well worth it. My background is mom in her 40's, 2 c-sections, diastasis recti, bad knees, back, sciatica, feet hurt. I was huffing and puffing just to do laundry going down the stairs. I'm a little overweight and definitely out of shape. I've tried so many things that I've gotten bored of, put off, aggravated one of my problems too much, etc. This app I can add my own old Thrash metal and I can keep it on easy and get more cardio than I have in my whole life because I hate exercise with a passion. I've played about 5 months now a few times a week and lost 8 lbs without counting a single calorie. My legs are so much stronger. My knees and back feel much improved. It motivated me to add dumbells into my life on off days which helped me close my 18 year diastasis recti all the way. So my core is actually not as weak. I never get bored of this game because of the music I can add. The only thing I'll say is I had to learn how to do squats on the arthritis website and start taking joint vitamins and wear knee support at first because my form was bad and it was painful! So be careful if your like me and don't feel bad if you're best off on easy mode. You don't have to be crazy on it to benefit.  My favorite place to go is the galaxy, ride the lightning!"
88,Red,Jul 26 at 4:19 PM,4,Great Workout,"While I've only played a few times so far, I do get a pretty good workout. The advanced seems to be too fast, so I wish there was a level between beginner and advanced. Love the fact that it is like boxing, however I have a hard time getting into the rhythm. Im not sure if it's the spacing of the objects or what. Still trying to figure out how to load my own custom songs, but cannot find a good tutorial on how to load them on the Quest 2. So a video on how to do that would be nice. It's a great workout with no subscription fee."
89,Mathilda the Badger,Jul 26 at 3:49 PM,5,Great Workout!,"Unlike some other Rhythm/Fitness games, this one has me in a sweat in no time! I love the ability to add own songs and have a workout generated for me. No other game I've seen can do this!"
90,Browncoat,Jul 3 at 4:58 PM,5,"Full Body, Full Fun","Powerbeats is one of the best rhythm games available on the Quest. 

Unlike some others, it really encourages full-body movement. There's a great variety to the types of obstacles and motions. 

The difficulty settings allow for players of differing physical abilities to play at a level that suits them (my back and knees don't take kindly to the tunnels, so I switch them off). The different environments are fun and interesting.

All in all 10/10, would definitely recommend giving it a try. I'm looking forward to seeing where the developers take this one."
91,Zeph,Jul 26 at 3:47 PM,5,Amazing fitness game! Fun rhythm game!,"This game has the best of both worlds. You can play your own songs, it has one of the best chart creators, and you get a crazy workout too. Just give it a shot! You won't regret it!"

94,Jninefire,"May 7, 2022 at 3:49 PM",5,"Excellent, Fun, Solid Workout","I workout in VR every single day in a variety of apps, and this is one of my favorites. It‚Äôs one of the best apps for squats, and I love that they make them fun and that they actually count them for you. It makes a goal of 100 squats easy and rewarding. They also have you shifting left, right, and center, as well as high and low, so the workout is dynamic. I saw some complaints about the rails, and I‚Äôd argue that the rails are fantastic to add in other elements while you are catching them‚Äîfor example, do heel pulses, hip shimmies, balance on one foot, or balance on the balls of your feet‚Äî pick one element and do it an entire song every time you do a rail. I love the environments and visuals. I mostly just do the basic fists setting. The beginner setting makes a nice warmup and cooldown, and advanced really gets my heart rate going and body moving. I‚Äôm not a fan of expert, yet, because getting slammed in the face with a wall or spike bomb is just unpleasant. This is not a problem with advanced, so I think I just need to ‚Äúget good.‚Äù They do not have a lot of songs yet (maybe 20), but the ones they have are a great mix with a good beat that most people will enjoy. You can add your own songs; I‚Äôm really limited with time so I haven‚Äôt gotten around to doing that, so I can‚Äôt review that aspect. Finally, I think this game is up there with the best workout and rhythm games (FitXR, Les Mills, Audio Trip, Synth Rider, Beat Saber, etc.), so if you like them and want more variety, you will like Power Beats."

102,Dani,"May 6, 2022 at 7:24 PM",5,Goldilocks of the exercise apps/games,"Love this! I end with a few PowerBeats songs at the end of each VR session. Great workout! Really fun! I am not a fan of the ""fake""/computer-y world/dark BeatSaber type exercise apps. I like that this one takes you to different outdoor locations (although I would love to see more than just four), and you're not hitting glowing/electronic/computer-y things, you're hitting boulders and balls and ""real"" such stuff. The music is fun, great variety. (Haven't uploaded my own at this point.) 

I think I'll stick with the Beginner level forever, b/c although I'm fit and exercise regularly, I tried an Advanced level song yesterday and nearly had to go to the ER - heartrate was out of control and starting having tons of crazy heart palpitations (and quit the song not even halfway through). I don't know how anyone would be able to keep up with that insane pace. I would love to see an Intermediate level (currently there's Beginner, Advanced and Expert). The Beginner is a great workout, but maybe after awhile I'd like something in between Beginner and Advanced? I can't even imagine Expert. Sounds like sudden death. 

AND NO SUBSCRIPTION FEE!!! That's the biggie here too. SuperNatural looks cool, but some months (summer) I'm doing more outdoor exercise. I'm not interested in any VR subscription model games."
103,partypetee,"Apr 25, 2022 at 11:28 PM",5,Best exercise to music game I've played,"There are a few things I like the most about this game so far:

1. It starts with punching the balls flying at you, while you dodge the walls and bad balls. With a 4 types of environments to play in and can customize to make it easier or harder. You can also unlock hammers to play with and a couple others I haven't unlocked yet

2. It tracks the time you've played and squats done with calories burned to reach your goal

3. It allows the option to add your own music to auto generate courses to them and create playlists (I haven't tried this yet, since I still have been playing the songs it came with but I look forward to it based on the other reviews)

4. Active developers listening to users about things they want added to the game"

And its just a simple upload process to add all of your favorite songs. Once uploaded, the software MAPS the songs/beats for you! There is absolutely no sideloading necessary. I get really swept up in the fun and end up doing way more than I had planned. It even keeps track of your squats/lunges, etc within each song.  This game is worth every penny!"

106,David The Kiwi,"May 1, 2022 at 1:56 PM",5,Blown Away,"I came across this by accident and can't praise it enough. The devs have taken this to next level awesome, everything is incredibly intuitive, clear and easy to use, but also full of features I cannot believe, the best of course being the ability to import your own music and customise your own maps. This is my go-to exercise app now. 

I have one suggestion for an improvement that should be fairly simple...it would open a whole additional market if you include an automatic HIIT map option. That would generate a map that mixed the squats and punches with rails in a HIIT format. If you also enable it to be applied to a Playlist then you've just cornered the full spectrum of the home fitness market.

Keep up the good work!"

109,Pirx,"Apr 13, 2022 at 12:16 AM",3,Needs work,"All the positive reviews got my expectations really high. Overall it has good potential and I'll be waiting for updates but for now it needs some more work. 

- the four environments are too few, they get old quickly. It would be good to have more variety also in terms of how they play - for now they just feel like different backgrounds for the same thing 

- I don't know what it is about hitting objects in this game but it doesn't feel feedbacky enough. In fitxr or Thrill or BS it actually feels like hitting stuff; here you are sort of swinging your arms through empty holograms that just fly straight. They should feel heavier and the hit should feel more tangible 

- the music selection seems rather uninteresting. I'm not expecting (and don't want) newest pop hits but just choose nice juicy pieces that have strong catchy rhythm to play to

- the obstacles fly too fast, too often. As some other comment said it you can't charge a hit properly. Connect that with the ""doesn't feel like hitting"" thing above and you end up kinda madly swinging around in the air instead of planning nice hits"
110,Jojo,"May 5, 2022 at 2:01 AM",5,Awesome!,Although I just started and I am only on level 3 I absolutely love this app. Work out is awesome and totally sweat doing it.

Having downloaded powerbeats it is the business!  The workouts got me building up a sweat quick and the difficulty can increase insanely.  Add to the fact that you can edit your own workouts (though I haven't tried this yet), it's well worth buying if you're looking for fitness in VR.  I hope the Devs keep up the good work and that the app gets it's rightful place in the main store."

I love the fact you don‚Äôt need a subscription and you can upload your own music, although I haven‚Äôt tried that yet. I get a full on cardio workout and sweat session during every gameplay. So many squats!! I‚Äôve been playing about 30 minutes every morning to get my brain motivated and my blood pumping. I don‚Äôt really have any cons to speak of- the only suggestion is maybe adding something to feel the punches. I have no doubt this game will have some excellent updates to come!"
114,SHIBArmy,"Apr 24, 2022 at 12:05 AM",5,PowerBeatsVR is a WNNER!!!,"As a 56 year-old with afib, a bad back, and knee pain, I‚Äôve purchased just about every rhythm exercise game, but NONE of them compare to PowerBeatsVR.

Visually, the game environments are stunning. The objects flying at you look like they have actual weight and are very satisfying to hit and dodge. The flowing beams give off a sense of real energy that you‚Äôre absorbing with your hands.

Oddly, you feel like a superhero as you play, smashing away at the incoming projectiles. They break up realistically too. Lol, there were even times when I hit a super hero landing pose (well, sort off).

Best of all, you can easily upload your music. I‚Äôm a big fan of movie themes. Imagine playing to Avengers music. Check! Or the Star Wars theme!! Yep!! Or the Dark Knight Rises!!! Oh yeah!!

Time will be suspended. You‚Äôll forget you‚Äôre exercising until the headset comes off and the sweat along with it.

Plus the game has so many options and modifiers - all neatly organized.

Another reason I love this game is how you can easily make it as easy or hard as you want. It‚Äôs accessible to every level of player.

Don‚Äôt think twice! Just get it and enjoy!!"
115,MrCrowley,"Feb 16, 2022 at 4:13 PM",5,It's a video game workout!!!!,"We've all seen the promises that other games provide (not just Quest games) about working out while playing a game. This one lives up to the hype!! It's a sweat session but it's fun! If you are starting your health journey, be warned you will feel this the next day. I haven't figured out how to add my own songs.....yet, but I am still enjoying the in game music. Allowing this to link into already existing music services (Apple, YouTube Music, Amazon and Spotify etc) would take this to the next level! Get this game, and get your fun healthy journey started!"
116,Matt,"Jan 4, 2022 at 12:35 AM",5,"YES, it is better than Supernatural....!","I know why you're here, and I know why you're reading this...  I'll tell you right upfront - YES, PowerBeats VR is LIGHTYEARS ahead of Supernatural (and any other VR workout program).  

I used Supernatural every day for 6 months.  Then, one day, I got sick of having songs being forced on me, I got sick of not being able to choose individual songs from the workouts, I got sick of paying for new content that was from Genres I would never dream of listening to, I got sick of not having enough options to change different aspects of my workout, I got sick of not being able to use my own songs, I got sick of paying nearly $20 a month for an app that I was starting to dread.  Most importantly, I was SICK of hearing the coaches yap during every SINGLE second of every SINGLE song.  Nonstop.  Cute anecdotes, charming stories, hollow encouragement.... ugh.  Before you ask, NO, you CANNOT mute the coaches completely.  They are always there - chirping away.  This is even worse if you even want to think about repeating a workout.... hearing the fake banter all over again.

PowerBeatsVR LITERALLY solves every issue i complained about above - and it's a one time buy.  Read everything I wrote above, and reverse it - THAT is PowerBeatsVR.  It put the POWER of workout back into YOUR control!!"
117,Scott Q,"Mar 28, 2022 at 5:46 PM",3,Customized music üëçüèª backgrounds üëéüèª,"I‚Äôll start with the cool part: you can easily import your own music and it will automatically generate a map so you don‚Äôt have to get into the guts of it and program it. Once imported, you can make some adjustments as to level of difficulty, speed, obstacles, etc, I like that - a lot! I‚Äôve imported about a dozen songs. It makes the game much more fun.

However, unlike other similar apps, I‚Äôm losing interest because the pattern of virtually every song is so similar that they‚Äôre almost the same. Add to that that it‚Äôs always one of the same four backgrounds and I‚Äôm getting bored. I don‚Äôt use it as often as I did and I‚Äôve only had it about a month.

My suggestion is to somehow give us more variety and better visual effects. Once that‚Äôs done, the ability to add one‚Äôs own music will make this first class. I‚Äôll keep checking in, but it‚Äôs not in my top tier right now."

138,Hi.NotYou.Hi.,Jun 23 at 9:19 AM,4,Best Exercise Game,"First off: NO SUBSCRIPTION. Pay one time and you get a more fun than games like Supernatural. Also, being able to use your own music library to play to and the developers are still adding new features, and this is a must-have. Love this game and hope it gets the success it deserves.

Edit: As much as I love this game, having played games like Synth Riders, I had to dock the game a star because for nearly the same price, the presentation and issues with the game can't hold a candle to them. Powerbeats is now increased to $23 but has very repetitive note mapping, is less precise with tracking, stagnant library, and custom music still works somewhat poorly. I still love the game, but they need to make some more improvements and drop the price to $20 or less."
139,smileybug98,"Apr 18, 2022 at 9:02 AM",4,It's pretty good,"It's a fun game, my only complaint is that I'm 5,4 and some of the rocks are way out of my reach. They should make an option to ask how tall you are and set it so the rocks only come to a certain height. I have to jump and sometimes even then I can't reach the rocks.

144,Tetiana.DVR,"Dec 15, 2021 at 7:13 PM",5,No more subscription!,"This game is a solid competitor to subscription-based VR fitness games! The movements are really dynamic and highly customizable - you move around and squat a lot which is great for cardio. Even though it only has 4 environments, they are really well made! I like the fantasy style of working out in the clouds, on a space ship, in the desert or in medieval times! Also the custom weapons that you unlock along the way add this game an extra spice! These ways to customize your workout is what makes working out with PowerBeatsVR fun and not as repetitive as some other fitness games. 

And of course, the workout generator which allows you to upload your own custom songs is a killer feature! I've got lots o fmp3 files on my PC which I just loaded on to my Quest 2 and the app managed to map out custom levels of various difficulties for each song, which is amazing! I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a quality VR workout and don't want to pay subscription cost!"

Update:  Now all my friends want a Quest 2 and Powerbeats VR too !!  
learned how to upload my own music, and learning a bit about the generator to get the 'speed' I want.....I like to warmup with a beginner level then move to Advanced....but often Beginner is too slow....not that I'm a pro !!! ....but adjusting the generator makes 'beginners' a great warm up !
Having so much fun.....just wish I had more stamina......must remember I'm 64 !! not 24 !!!

150,KatsPurr,"Dec 23, 2021 at 2:29 AM",5,Highly customizable experience!,"I've tested so many workout games on the Oculus store and I find that while each of them have things I like, they also have things I don't like. I've been looking for an exercise app that brings together all the good stuff, and PowerBeats comes pretty darned close!

There are two things that I especially like: #1 The fact that the stuff you hit is not assigned to left/right. So if you're like me and get stressed out about keeping track of the correct side like in other games, with PowerBeats you can just freeform it and hit in whatever way feels best for you! This is not only less stressful but also gives you the freedom to ""change up"" your movements without being forced to follow the game's directions and sides. #2 Like other fitness apps, PowerBeats also lets you bring in your own custom songs and create choreographies for them. But what it does better is the absolute ease with which it allows you to do this! Unlike other apps where you have to dig around the app's own folders to find where to put ogg files, PowerBeats recognizes MP3's and you can just drop them right into the devices media folder! What's best is that it has it's own automatic choreography generator. So if you don't feel like fiddling around and just want to jump right into the action, you can!

Although PowerBeats has a few small things it could improve upon - like the rope experience, the team seem to have a great attitude and willingness to listen to player feedback. I only see great things ahead for this app and warmly recommend adding this into your fitness app collection!"

153,Kohalmis,"Feb 8, 2022 at 12:51 AM",5,Life Saver! LOVE IT!!,"If you have health issues or concerns, this app will allow you to exercise at your own comfort level and actually work up a sweat!! I suffered a traumatic fall and have irreversible back issues. I also had a traumatic injury on my foot. I have osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia and PCOS/insulin resistance. So for me to lose weight means not just to eat less but I need to incorporate aerobic exercise. For years I've suffered in pain physically, mentally and emotionally. On a treadmill or elliptical I couldn't work up a sweat because of my health issues. Just laying on the floor is painful so simple yoga was a bust. I tried the yoga ball, resistance bands but I got bored FAST!! I kind of gave up, problem is my mind was so use to getting up and going and my body couldn't anymore. Then comes Santa Claus dropping off the Oculus for my kids. We had played Beat Saver on a relatives oculus and thought it was fun so Santa thought it would be a great gift. I was happy to try Beat Saver but even after buying tons of songs I started to get bored with the same repetition. I downloaded Supernatural but wasn't about to pay $20 a month. Then comes someone's comment about Powerbeats. I saw the demos then read these reviews and was thrilled there was no subscription. First time I used it I worked up to 169bpm and was sweating like crazy and breathing heavy. It was great getting that feeling back without feeling in pain or getting bored. That's the best part of this app. I never get bored, it's a great HIT type workout, it has great positive reinforcement, the music is upbeat, the scenery is great. Even if I only get 15 minutes in, I feel good about it and I don't have any unnecessary pain (typical muscles working pain only)  I've been in such a better mood too. Thanks for saving my life!!"

Go in with an open mind and be ready to MOVE!  I think I used every muscle in my body!

Playing to my own music is very important and was super simple to set up!  My initial playlist is 1 hour 5 minutes!  And I did the whole thing without even thinking about it. Never got bored or checked the clock for a countdown. I just kept moving and didn't want to quit! 

I'm only 2 days in, so still figuring it all out.

165,Cholo,"Feb 27, 2022 at 12:36 PM",1,"It's not fitness, it's a rhythm game","Right now this game is just a rhythm game.
Doesn't matter how fast you hit the balls, actually they are so fast you can't even charge the punch to hit them.
And mostly they comes two at time. So for most of the game you just position the hands to ""touch"" the balls.
In the end, It doesn't works as a boxing training in any way, which is a shame because I would love to say goodbye to the FitXR membership scam. But this just doesn't help at all.

And there is also trails to follow with the hands... which are frankly useless from a workout prospective.
Is basically a less polished Synthrider with a bit more ducking.

Squats are the only things actually make you struggle, but I'm not a kid and I would like to use my knees for a couple of decades more at least. And I don't need a game to make some squat tbh.

I like the ability to add custom songs, but I didn't tried it so I don't know how they are gonna be ""converted"" into a workout.
I'm confident they are not worst than the included songs, because they are pretty bad. And the obstacles sounds pretty random anyway, so if you can change them with good music, that would be something at least.

Also, not being able to position and center the playspace by pressing the oculus button is very annoyng.
You can rotate the playspace in the option but only by 90 degrees.... c'mon folks, this is sidequest bul***it nobody want to see in a proper game.
In the end, the game was very delusional at this stage, right now it's quite useless to workout. Still keeping a little bit of hope for the future... I add a star only for that.

UPDATE: They fixed the positioning thing, but the game didn't progressed at all. Pointless to workout, unpolished, there are way better boxing and fullbody training out there now. I'm done with this, sucks for the wasted money."

PowerBeats VR is more challenging with requirements to squat and dodge the walls and fire balls. I get a lot of enjoyment from punching the balls coming at me and I truly am sore and sweaty after 20 minutes of playing.

I tried playing at an advanced level and it kicked my butt. I had to go to intermediate despite the fact I am fairly fit and work out five days a week.

If you are on the fence about a fun program that will keep you engaged and has the added benefit of fitness. I would highly urge you to consider PowerBeats VR."

169,Keltee,"Jan 5, 2022 at 5:58 AM",5,Best Fitness Game on Oculus !,I am 63 years young and have tried many VR  fitness games in the past year. Power Beats is hands down the best out there. It gets you moving and it is fun. Love that I can load my own 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs music. This is a great perk!!!  and no subscription.  Thank you Power Beats. Keep up the great work and you have my vote to get you on the main Oculus !!!
170,Cara,"Feb 23, 2022 at 12:54 AM",5,Punch Rocks in Space!,"I love this app. I stumbled upon on it after doing a ton of research on different fitness apps available in the Oculus store. Heck I even tried Supernatural, which everyone apparently loves. But I hated Supernatural. I just wanted a fitness game where I could listen to good music and not be disturbed by weird trainers. Not only that but you can upload songs to this game. The uploaded bit is a lot better than other games with the same functionality, so while it could be better in terms of hitting every beat perfectly, it‚Äôs pretty dang close. 

It‚Äôs certainly not perfect, there is a bug with generating the uploaded song runs (I tried to turn off squats for one song because my legs were too tired and it didn‚Äôt turn it off, so I had to go through the full song and edit it similar to Audio Trip). 

Some things I especially love are that you aren‚Äôt restricted to left or right specific hits, so it takes less thinking on that part so you can focus more on form, and the settings are gorgeous! 

It truly is a fantastic game. So scoop it up if you wanna get fit while punching rocks in space!!"

173,kastumped,"Feb 14, 2022 at 9:13 AM",5,Great workout app,"I originally bought this on sale, refunded it (because I had so many other workout apps) but bought this again this week as it is just a generally great option and I think ties in well with the other workout apps I use (mainly Les Mills and X-Fitness along with Synth Riders/Ragnarock/Audio Trip) and holds up well alongside them.

Main reason to go for one of these apps is the lack of subscription which I think works better for most people."
174,Jackpants,"Feb 15, 2022 at 8:25 PM",4,"Good workout, bad beat timing","I have tried this and X-fitness on app lab. They can both be a good workout and parse custom songs, which is great.

The deal-breaker problem (with both) is the hit timing is not sync'd to the beat. I can see how it's supposed to go, but my natural punch gets way ahead of the beat, so if I want to actually connect with the targets on beat, I have to punch WAY to close / almost behind my body center. I have therefore move back in my play space but still cannot quite compensate, and the offset is a little different for each object. I'm very rhythmically oriented so this drives me absolutely nuts and the constant cringing makes this not pleasant.

Both systems need a target delay slider in options to change when the targets arrive relative to the beat, and, ideally, a calibration / test range where you either hit a stationary object at a comfortable range along with a simple beat to auto-determine your offset for each object type, or have the different object types fly at you on beat and let you adjust the slider until it feels right.

I like the idea of getting more points for power, but it takes almost zero effort to max it out and I don't see a way to increase the difficulty. It would also be nice if hard hits / difficult objects made a satisfying boom noise, or exploded into colors or something.

I'm 6'5"" if that helps the devs. I will be returning it, unfortunately, and stick with audio trip (perfect timing game) until this is fixed."
175,Dmitry Berezhnoy,"Mar 14, 2022 at 8:01 AM",5,No subscription fees,I cannot commit to VR fitness to justify $20 montly fees. This app strikes the balance for me. Being able to tune to my own workout playlist is an extra perk.

178,Sunwise,"Feb 8, 2022 at 7:13 PM",5,Great workout app!,"So glad I found this app. It is all I was hoping for and more. 
Beginner mode let's you customize your workout by giving you enough time to hit the balls from different directions, while the higher difficulties challenge your reaction speed and eye-hand coordination.
Love the fact this is not a subscription."
179,BonoVox87,"Jan 7, 2022 at 7:28 PM",5,A great alternative to TOTF,"Bought this as I needed something to workout to besides thrill of the fight, and bar one gripe I love this game. 

The environments are beautiful without distracting from the game itself. The option to build playlists is great and enables you to make your workouts as long or intense as you want. The music does the job of getting you psyched to workout. My ONE gripe however is the streams. I feel these should be optional because it's momentum breaking and feels like a break I don't need half the time so to be able to take this away and really get punching, dodging and squatting without losing that intensity. If the Devs could make these optional I would bump this up to a worthy 5*. 

Should be on the main store, great alternative to the subscription model which I'm not a fan of. For now though you(the reader) are here and I recommend this if you want a great portfolio of workout games or even if this is your first. Great job Devs

Update: Review bumped up to 5* after discovering the customizing sliders to minimise or maximise objects and obstacles in-game. Near perfect fitness game that you should definitely get if you're not a fan of subscription models. Would be right at home on the official Oculus store"

Would like for streamers to separate far from each other then come together and then separate again, moving in different directions, Then one hand up and one down , then back again . It is boring with them just staying together and going up and down a little.  More better know music would be great also.  Glad I got it."
183,ladybizarre,"Feb 2, 2022 at 3:30 PM",5,I love it,"I serached so long for a game like this. I played box Vr before they turned into a sh*ty monthly abo bs. 
This is like the old Box Vr and I love it.
I just have some ideas for the game developers:
Optional Different stones for left and right hand.
The walls need to be thinner. I dont have that much space and it happens very often, that my right or left hand hits the wall, cause i cant move so much right or left. 
Daily achievements or goals that motivates you to keep on."
184,Samantha,"May 30, 2022 at 4:18 PM",5,Frigging great exercise,I am drenched!!! This game is apar with all the other exercises games in the main store. Try it! It is pretty fun!
185,SomeRK,"Jan 17, 2022 at 11:23 PM",5,Surprisingly great!,"I saw a YouTube video about VR exercise games and heard this was a Supernatural/FitXR type of exercise app and has an engine to allow you to add music and generate workouts from that. 
I like both FitXR and Supernatural, but really want to listen to music I like. 
I get more motivated by music than coaches, but had not heard of this app before. I thought it would be generic FitXR with my own songs, which would be great.
It turns out, not only does adding my own music work and make the experience more fun, the game has a few wrinkles that the others don‚Äôt. There is a bit more variety available. Tools you can use, instead of fists, some variation in the types of objects to punch or avoid.
Was surprised how much more there was. Really like the variety. Having fun and getting a workout!"
186,Dark Helmet,"Feb 1, 2022 at 5:54 PM",5,Amazing for an early release/Lab app,"I purchased this, with expected thought I would end up  returning it and biting the bullet to subscribe to  supernatural or something else, but I got this.. started my garmin cardio setting and started playing.. thinking wow that was a decent workout. When I stopped my watch expecting 15 mins.. nope 30 mins later. I guess they gamified the workout achieved and a good time. I look forward to future releases, and maybe a spotify/amazon/apple music integration. Paying for the app up front is better than subscribing to something every time."
187,Smiley sloth,"Feb 1, 2022 at 9:59 PM",5,Powerbeats VR,"Great visuals, a level to suit beginners to expert. A bit like aerobics but much more entertaining.  Works out all sorts of muscles while keeping it fun, 5 star

188,Rattata,"Feb 1, 2022 at 3:28 PM",5,Great work out,"This app looks great and really gets you moving. 
Worth the cost. 
Lots of options you can select from. More opening up as you progress. Stunning visuals, great music, varied tracks. 
The more I play the more I enjoy this app. 

The walls, and tunnels and spiked balls that you need to avoid work so much better than the see-through boxes of other alternatives. It makes so much more sense to my brain. It‚Äôs not about remembering to move away from those objects, it becomes natural. I want to move away instinctively. This ‚Äútricks‚Äù me into moving much better. It‚Äôs the logical thing to do. Great programming!

And also the variety in track design. Different songs give me different workouts. Also love the progressive steps from beginner to advanced to expert. It really fleshes out the experience as I progress. 


Highly recommended!"
189,Lynn,"Jan 30, 2022 at 3:07 AM",5,This quickly became one of my favorites!,I love this game!  My arms feel the burn by the time I am done with each set. You punch the balls that come at all heights so you are squatting and punching. There are ropes that fly at you and you need to keep your gloves up to block the rope.  The music is great and there are lots of different options to choose from. I play supernatural every day but I feel the burn more with this game.  It is a great workout  and a perfect addition to my exercise lineup!
190,Atc1990,"Jan 29, 2022 at 3:19 AM",5,Outstanding!,"As a fan of Beat Saber, I thought I would give this a try. I was pleasantly surprised on how well done this is. The ability to customize the playing experience is amazing. Don‚Äôt want to deal with the walls? No problem, one click and they are gone, and just as easy to turn back on.
But the most important aspect, for me at least, is the ability to import your own songs! It scans the song and creates a level, with multiple difficulty setting, and away you go. That alone made it more than worth the money.
Oh, and it is a one time buy too! Love, love, love PowerBeatsVR!!!"

193,Jesse,"Jan 27, 2022 at 2:22 AM",5,Wow!! Buy this!,I have tried a few of the workout apps on the Oculus and this one is by far the best. Has a great mix of workouts and virtual spaces.

Ditch your subscription apps and pay the price for this app with no subscription ever!
194,Rafael,"Jan 24, 2022 at 1:08 AM",5,It's the Best fitness VR game,"In my humble opinion this is the best fitness VR game out there! Unlike others fitness VR apps that charge you a monthly subscription, PowerBeats VR only requires from you a one time purchase. 

Its a fun way to do some exercise and get back in shape again. Another cool feature of Powerbeats VR is that it allows you to use custom music for your works out. Yes, thats right you can import your downloaded mp3 to the game. It will generate different levels based on your favorite songs. This adds so much more replayability and makes working out way more pleasant."

Only thing on my want list is multiple profiles so my wife could use it too. Don't mind paying additionally for that feature. Regardless, exactly what I needed."

I will actually play a round of the other more sedate fitness apps to catch my breath and then its back to another high intensity round in PowerBeatsVR. I find I am doing more full body range of motions, and more body movement, with this app. I am winded, satisfied with my workout, wildly entertained, and most importantly no monthly subscription. The added benefit of pulling  my own music into the app and creating my own playlist was a nice added touch. PowerBeatsVR is now my go to fitness app for a real workout :)"
199,Jan,"Jan 20, 2022 at 5:37 PM",5,Such an awesome workout!,"I love this workout. For one thing it is a very good workout. However, unlike Beat Saber, it is soooo easy to add your own music to it. That was the only thing about Beat Saber that was not so good. It was not user friendly at all to add your own music and the music that comes with it is not to my liking. This program, super easy to add and remove. This gives you an endless variety of  music to work out to. Love it."
200,Royboy9,"Jan 20, 2022 at 3:48 PM",5,Highly recommend!,"I purchased this game a few weeks ago because I was looking to incorporate a fun fitness app into my routine.

You won‚Äôt regret trying this one!"
202,SteelReign,"Feb 18, 2022 at 12:54 AM",3,Stutters on start,"A little disappointed with this app so far. Slightly  more fitness focused than beatsaber, but not as focused as body combat.

Biggest problem, however, is that the game stutters for the first 15-30 seconds of each song on my Quest 2 making it nearly unplayable for that time."
203,Alex,"Jan 19, 2022 at 3:49 AM",5,My favorite workout to date,"I'm so glad I stumbled onto this game.  I tried several other workout apps but could not stick with them.  The scenery is beautiful and the workout is fun. The library might not be as vast as Supernatural, but there is still plenty of customization available and no subscription price or annoying trainers talking in your ear. The only thing I don't like as much are the streams, I think because they remind me of Synthriders, and I like the boxing/punching aspect of this much more. Some of the workouts do contain minimal streams so that is a plus. Love the music too. If you are looking for a combo of Supernatural and FitVR in one non-subscription package this is it."
204,Meriah,"Jan 19, 2022 at 3:44 AM",5,Great fitness app,"Haven't used it for long, but it's been fantastic. It's much more of a workout than some of the less fitness focused apps (as it should be). Really attractive scenery, solid music. Looking forward to using it a lot more! Biggest issue is how much of a hassle it was to find on the app lab. I wish it was less hidden! And then i couldn't purchase it at first. Finally got it, though!"
205,NBSoph,"Jan 18, 2022 at 4:17 PM",5,Awesome workout game,"I have only played beginner so far but this game is kicking my butt.  Love the workout especially with lockdown, nice to workout at home.

207,Martin Glenn,"Jan 17, 2022 at 6:58 PM",5,Love this app.,"Having owned this on Steam and using the pcvr version i was really pleased when i found out that there is a version that can now run natively on the quest 2. I am a typical 40 something guy with no motivation to work out but with this i feel more inclined to as it makes things more enjoyable. The fact that you can add your own music and create playlists with ease adds to the fun. I really cant tell any noticeable difference between the PC version and the standalone, now i can just pop on the headset and play. This deserves to be on the main store and not app lab."
208,TimeTravelGirl,"Oct 20, 2021 at 7:46 PM",5,Far exceeds other beat games,"This workout game is by far one of the best out there hands down.  Firstly, it is ergonomic in the workout movements.  It more closely resembles boxing; a more natural way to move the arms. Secondly you can use your own custom songs via its awesome auto-generator.  For me, having my own music is really important as a motivator; the built-in music in many other games just doesn't get me going.   I am super impressed!  The third coolest thing are the environments.  They exceed most other environments in other games. No bright backgrounds or pink/purples and neon colors ... these are actually quite beautiful and realistic (in a spacy good way).  In fact I am so excited about these, I imagine other cool themes that could come such as a green jungle theme, or perhaps an underwater theme.  Wow! Other amazing features are a-Its a heck-of-a workout. I am sweating buckets and I am already fairly fit! b-MANY customizable options!  Have a sore hip? Simple, just turn down the walls to duck under.  Want more challenge? Add it in! c-Amazing support from the Team! If there are any issues, don't give it a bad review right away, first contact the Devs and they can often help! This game is actually getting me in good enough cardio shape to do my Search and Rescue for this winter."

When I started out with this app I went to straight to the higher difficulty and I couldn‚Äôt finish the track 

But right now I can and I can tell I feel more agile 

So they did something right and I see a lot amazing potential in this project

I wish you success"
210,NoLastName,"Jan 17, 2022 at 12:43 AM",5,Your Songs & No Monthly Fees. YES!,"Two thumbs up! This looks great like in the demo. Uploading your own tracks is amazing. It automatically creates workouts from your mp3 uploads. The functionality is killer and makes the music way better than Supernatural. (The scenic visuals in Supernatural can't be beat though. This only has four available backgrounds.) 

There is a lot of customization available that could require a bit of tech savvy to fully utilize.  It took me some legwork to figure out that you can upload your MP3s to Google Drive and then easily download onto the headset with the Oculus browser. 

The other big selling point is no monthly subscription like Supernatural!"
211,potatjo,"Jan 15, 2022 at 10:09 AM",5,I like this game but,"I wish there were options to change the colors of the streams because the brightness of the particles flying into my face gives me migraines a little and they don‚Äôt match the location, I do like that for custom songs you can remove the streams! I wish they were darker and no so bright or had the option to remove the flying particles or make them smaller on the streams. Also I wish there was an option to turn off the sound of the fire crackers at the end of each song.

More locations would also be nice in the future maybe some pretty galaxies or the beach with a pink sunset with dolphins or something, but keep up the good work because I plan on playing this every day :)"
212,Jason Thomas,"Jan 14, 2022 at 6:34 AM",5,the only workout app you need,"I've owned on steam for ages, but bought it again for the freedom and portability of the Quest. I've tried a handful of workout apps on both platforms and this is my favorite by far. 
Similar mechanics to many, but this has great customization, the ability to import your own music, and a one time purchase rather than subscription."
213,Wolfie,"Jan 14, 2022 at 7:49 PM",5,Excellent work out and tons of fun!,"Love this game. Its great for fun and fitness. I was sceptical at first but it really gets your heart pumping and you get that muscle burn especially with tracks that make you squat (the king of exercises) lots. Great for core strength. Also works the upper body, the harder you punch those balls the better the work out. It keeps you moving too. Gotta duck and dodge those walls. And did I mention its great fun too!? :) First class app."
214,chucklas,"Feb 3, 2022 at 11:25 PM",4,"Very good game, still not perfect","I tried out this game as an alternative to paying for the subscription to Supernatural.  I have to say, it is a very good alternative.  The gam play is smooth, and the difficulty settings are nice as well.  Custom song support is great as well.

However, there are some issues that I have experienced.  For some reason, some of my music files for whatever reason cannot be played and there is no indication as to what the issue is.  If it were a format issue, etc, it would be nice to know so I could troubleshoot.  Also, the vertical obstacles almost always register as me hitting them even though I am clearly out of their way. 

I would love to see the ability to make a playlist out of custom songs so I can do a full workout without going back to the menu after each song.  

It would also be nice for it to connect to my heart rate monitor and provide that data after songs/workouts similar to Supernatural.

All in all, it is a nice cheaper alternative to a subscription based exercise game with custom song support.  However, it still lacks in a few areas.  Hopefully some of those things will improve over time."
215,Andree Paradis,"Jan 13, 2022 at 11:24 PM",5,Great workout,Just got back to workout routine of weight training and cardio. Gave this app a try and was pleasantly surprised what a good workout I got. Didn‚Äôt think virtual boxing would workout my muscles but boy did it ever. Prepare to be a little soar the next day. Warmed up with a beginner and did a few advanced sessions and another beginner to cool down. Love it!
216,Red,"Jan 12, 2022 at 10:02 PM",5,The workout game I was looking for.,"I started with supernatural and It was okay. Sure you could get a sweat going with it with either boxing or batons but half of the other content was stretching and meditation which i wasn't interested in. Also i can't stand the ""you got this feel the burn"" corny coaches that wont shut the hell up. I just wanted music and movement and scoring metric so i can see who well I'm doing and if i need to push harder. The game makes you move around a lot more than SN does, the music is better IMO(if you like dance edm) and you can add your own music if you want to hear other stuff. The Music in SN wasn't terrible but aside form like the 90's and 80's classics they had it was meh. I didn't understand why they wanted $10 a month. I would have gladly paid $50 one time for a solid workout app like this one. Thankfully i didnt have to.

There are some areas that could be improved however, it's not perfect. A optional and brief tutorial would have been appreciated. There are these ""ropes"" you have to follow with your hands and often them don't seem to make you move that much and this feels like a missed opportunity to make you move around with your arms up/out, or more across the room, instead they are usually slowly moving in front of you like you're raving. they often feel like an odd break in the middle of the workout instead of part of the workout. but I've only played a few levels on intermediate so maybe they are tougher in expert. Getting use to how far the game wants you to move to avoid certain obstacles takes a little getting used to but it's more than i was thinking at first but it's good helping to get you actually moving. The obstacles in Super Natural hardly made you duck or lunge and could really be done just by lowering your head a little.

Don't hesitate, this is one of the best workout games on oculus!!!"
217,Brenn_n,"Jan 12, 2022 at 5:53 AM",5,Awesome rhythm fitness game!!,PowerBeats is a high intensity fitness rhythm game that is great for workouts! You‚Äôll do a lot of strong punches and squats to the music you pick. The style of this game is definitely more concentrated and precise compared to games like Beat Saber and MoonRider that throw hundreds of notes at you as fast as possible. You can really focus on putting as much force into your punches as you can since the punches are more spread out. The best part about this game is the fact that you can upload your own music and the game will automatically generate a level to match your song! It definitely motivates me to play more often knowing that I can pick any song I want. Definitely a must buy if you‚Äôre using VR for exercise!
218,Lesties,"Jan 25, 2022 at 7:15 AM",5,This one!,"Super stoked I took a chance on this one, it's now my go to for my daily workout routine.

The levels and songs included in the game leave a lot to be desired (hopefully more get added) but the ability to add mp3s from your existing music library and auto generate the levels and edit them to your liking is the selling point.
220,Kyledoe,"Jan 23, 2022 at 5:33 AM",5,Awesome!,This is an awesome fitness app without a subscription like other users have said. it's very fun and engaging the only thing I wish it had is hand tracking so you dont have to use the controllers. Definitely 5 stars even without hand tracking

I was NOT interested in subscriptions and additional fees. 

My whole family, we LOVE powerbeats VR!  
We get our sweat on with BTS and other songs! 
Customizable for difficulty as well!

Great interface and super easy to use!"
222,PhoenixFire,"Jan 9, 2022 at 3:21 AM",5,Great workout,"I‚Äôve been using PowerbeatsVR in my daily workout. I usually get bored quickly and drop working out. This game has kept me going daily. I look forward to my workouts with it. 

I really like the ability to customize my workouts.

I‚Äôve tried other games like supernatural, pistol whip, beat saber, but nothing gets me sweating like Powerbeats VR.

Great job with this game, I looks forward to future features."
223,Topper,"Jan 9, 2022 at 3:09 PM",5,Get yourself some Workout!,"I have tried quite a lot of games which were supposed to give you ""workout"", but so far none came any close to this one.
This really makes you move a lot, do squats and I find it much more appealing to focus on the session itself, instead of chasing score (which is there and it's great motivator to get better) and overthinking ideal way how to play game (like in Beatsaber).
Tried most of includes songs, but they are not really my taste of music, here is where it gets great with this custom editor or autogenerated tracks from your own music - yes they are bit generic and following beat, unless you want to tinker with it a lot, but when you listen to what you like and just smash rocks, dodge, duck.. you forget about time and you get just great workout.
This game is first one where i was really sweating and a LOT after playing 10 songs from my favorite album.
Calories counter does not really coresponds with Oculus Move (Move shows like 30% less) lower, but who cares, i feel workout and having fun and that is important for me.
For me this is currently main workout game."
224,IIIhope,"Dec 16, 2021 at 3:58 PM",5,Best and most Affordable Workout Game!!,"This is by far the best game available on the Quest 2 for a great workout, in my humble opinion. No subscription is required is amazing because of all the workout games that make you pay monthly are pretty costly. I can also add my own music to work out to without messing anything in the game up. Best bang for your buck!!!"

7 Kilos with this and i still like it."
226,Offthetrail,"Jan 9, 2022 at 1:45 AM",5,Amazing!!,Absolutely love this. Just started it today and thought after a few beginner runs I would do an advance‚Ä¶ mistake üòÇ the 2m 30s run about made me sick (not from motion sickness but from pushing myself physically). I am pretty active so that says a lot! Definitely recommend you will not be disappointed.
227,Ironbug,"Jan 8, 2022 at 7:46 AM",5,Insane workout without the subscription,"This is one of the best VR fitness apps I have used. I don't like cardio and it is my weak point, with this app though it is fun and intense. I have noticed in the gym, my cardio has gone up since using this app.

About the app, it will give you a great cardio workout and work your arms and legs as well. You will be listening to music in one of 4 great looking environments, punch, squatting, dodging left to right, and following flows of energy that reminds me of swinging the ropes in the gym. Your heart rate is going to go up, and your legs and arms will feel the burn.

The app sets up a boundary inside your guardian to make sure you are far from hitting anything, so you can cut lose and have fun in your workout. It also has a built in calorie counter, and keeps track of your progress. You can earn levels to unlock new items to use in the workouts as well.

Unlike other apps that lock you to their music selection, this one lets you import your own music. Now you can have an amazing workout to the music you like.

This is a must have app for anyone looking to get into or maintain their shape."
228,Mahare,"Jan 8, 2022 at 5:05 AM",5,A good app for New Year's health!,"First game I got for my brand new Quest 2 and it beat me up - which is a good thing. I loaded up some music, smashed some boulders and dodged some walls, and thought nothing of it.

But, when you're in my physical condition, which is to say not good, you don't realize you might be run over by a steamroller the next day. And yet I will go back for more. I'm hoping for other backgrounds someday - we need a tundra to go with our desert after all - but this is my best purchase."
229,Aaron Sommers,"Feb 17, 2022 at 5:36 AM",5,,"Great work out app, would be Amazing if I could add music from my music service.  Love this app."
230,Fourthwisemonkey,"Jan 7, 2022 at 9:48 PM",5,Surprisingly good!,"Recently got my quest 2 and part of justification for buying it was to get my 55y/o butt off my sofa to do some much needed exercise. (retired this year and weight steadily going up....not ideal). Had a look at all the options out there and wanted something that was primarily exercise based rather than a game which caused you to exercise a bit (beat sabre etc). Powerbeats VR seemed to fit the bill and NO SUBSCRIPTION so all I had to lose was the purchase cost if I decided it was not for me. Been using it for couple of weeks now, every day for about 30 mins workout. I hate exercise but am enjoying this and especially like being able to simply add my own music (must hunt through my music collection a bit as a lot of my punk and metal stuff is a bit quick....might have to find some ballads). Am sticking to basic levels for now until I get a bit of fitness back. Probably the best purchase I have made in a long time. VR exercise is the future. OK the sweat filled headset at the end of a session not ideal but at least it shows I have acheived something!!! Would I recommend Powerbeats VR....YES 100%"
231,Curiousgeorge,"Jan 8, 2022 at 12:32 AM",5,Love this app!,"I'm a newbie to VR games and fitness, and chose this game for my Steam VR as it came highly recommended there. I recently switched to Quest and just had to get it again as it's so good. It's easy to use, the music is engaging, and this is my summer HIIT workout regime! It counts calories burned (so helpful), and boy do each one of those calories burn! The music is engaging and it's a great interval workout. I highly recommend!"
232,Radlings,"Jan 7, 2022 at 5:58 PM",5,Fab game for getting you moving,"New to VR and wanted to try something slightly more physical.

233,Sammie,"Jan 6, 2022 at 1:58 PM",5,Powerbeatsvr,"Powerbeatsvr is like if beatsaber and fitrx had a baby and that baby was awesome!  You want to mod it? No problem!  It's all built in.  Want to feel your legs burn, up the squats.  Don't feel like squats, that's OK too.  You can adjust  and create a workout  or let the app  create the workout for  you. 
And to top it off there is no monthly/yearly subscription!  Pay one time and have endless workouts üí™"
234,Simon,"Jan 6, 2022 at 12:35 PM",5,Unbelievable,"Yes, there a lot of rhythm games available, as well as fitness apps (that require subscription). On the surface this looks very much like many other rhythm punch fitness games, but the real game changer is adding your own music and just how well it translates to your workout. It has all the things you need (calorie counter, progression information, etc etc) but it's the ability to just add your own music and do a workout that makes all the difference. Everyone's musical taste is different, and being able to punch, weave, uppercut, squat, etc to whatever track you like WITHOUT SUBSCRIPTION (and for it to work properly) is a game changer. An amazing app that should be available on the main store ASAP."

Just a workout , I saw all the great reviews and decided to purchase it. I am so glad I did. I think this should be added to the Oculus store!
Hopefully we will get more music and more scenes to play in as it develops!
Give it a shot, I did.."

238,Branold,"Jan 5, 2022 at 11:35 PM",5,Great sub free workout,Wanted a workout app (sub and no sub considered) to compliment Beat Saber and ended up choosing Power beats from the bunch available.  Definately not disappointed! Catchy tunes to get you started for some great workouts.  Then you can get into mapping your own tracks. A family favourite in a short space of time. Add to that devs that respond to their community and things can only get even better.
239,Tamster,"Jan 5, 2022 at 10:45 PM",5,A Great workout (game),I really enjoy this app. It feels like a game but is a great work out. I especially love that you can easily add your own music and it automatically maps it. The graphics are crisp and immersive. I would like to see some type of turning and balls at more variety of heights. Otherwise-great job on this app. Looking forward to additions.

And this app is just what I was looking for! Very easy to get into it with lots of possibilities and you can easily adapt the intensity of your training (low skill floor, high skill ceiling).

I think this app is great for beginners to have such an easy entry to VR sports, paired with a never ending sports experience on the way to the top for a great long-term motivation!"

It's really fun, all while making my arms feel like jello and getting my heart rate way up. Great game."
245,Justin Time,"Jan 3, 2022 at 3:32 AM",5,Good workout,"In the new year I wanted to lose some weight, of course, in VR. So I bought Powerbeats. It does a lot of things right, the setting options are good, you can use your own songs, there are different levels of difficulty and the level progression is also motivating. A highscore list with friends or multiplayer would be a great update in the future to increase motivation."

247,RoboSmasher,"Jan 3, 2022 at 7:04 PM",5,Solid fitness game that is very fun,"This is a very solid vr fitness game. I have not tried custom songs or making my own maps yet. For those wondering, the gameplay is similar to Synth Riders except for boxing instead of dancing. It also is much more fitness focused and feels less like a game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, that doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt fun. I am currently having a blast working up a sweat. Another huge plus is the lack of a subscription. I wholeheartedly dislike the subscription model that other fitness games are moving to. Definitely recommended. It‚Äôs on sale right now so no excuse not to pick it up."
248,Wouter,"Jan 9, 2022 at 12:53 PM",5,Great fitness game,This game really works up a sweat. I love it and it's fun. I use the game almost every day. It doesn't get boring. I started playing this game because of the fact that it didn't use any subscriptions and in my opinion it looks much better then subscription based games.
249,Kimberly,"Jan 2, 2022 at 9:24 PM",5,I love everything about this fitness app,"This app is as good (or better) than any fitness app that I have tried. The locations are cool, and remind me of the settings in other great apps like the ForeVR games. Who doesn‚Äôt want to work out in front of a castle or in space? 

The multiple levels of exertion, the amount you can customize each workout, the need to actually earn new ways to interact (for example, unlocking the hammer), and the built in songs are all great, but my favorite thing is the ability to add your own music. It is so easy, and the app automatically maps for you, but you can add more challenges if you wish.

Also, if you know a few boxing moves, the app is perfectly set up to shadow box. While it doesn‚Äôt teach you these moves, the fact that obstacles are not assigned to one hand or the other allows you to jab and uppercut away. 

And to top it all off - there is no subscription. A one time, extremely reasonable fee covers all of the above!

I cannot recommend this app enough. It will never get old as I can add new songs and customize to my hearts content."
250,Brendan,"Jan 16, 2022 at 9:52 AM",5,Great Workout,"Yes, in some ways it is similar to beatsaber in that it is a rhythm game, but you can honestly tell that the focus here is on fitness. Love all the squatting because often vr games don‚Äôt focus on legs. Great fun way to stay fit"

Most of the music is great, but if not, you can add your own.  All and all it‚Äôs one of my favorites."
252,Tomi,"Jan 1, 2022 at 2:34 PM",5,No additional purchase needed,"Really Good workout game with great songs and diverse difficulty! You really need to purchase this once and no additional cost for future songs and updates!

You really need to smash, dodge and slice your way trough challenging songs!

I would give this 6/5 but it's not possible so I would give only 5 stars

P.S: If you dont want to smash Into things you really need big play space for this to work properly"
253,Chris Kazmierczak,"Jan 4, 2022 at 8:50 AM",5,Great fitness app WITH NO SUBSCRIPTION!,"I highly recommend! played this for awhile tonight for the first time. It is a challenging enough to get your heart rate up on beginner and gets insane on expert (possibly my only complaint `BTW). Best part Is no subscription! If like me, you pay for a gym membership already in actual reality you aren't going to pay for a VR one at a similar price point. Right? I'm curious how it will fare if I use my own music but, even without, the stock library is pretty solid, so this is going to be great for filling in the gaps on my fitness routine!

Edit 1/4/2022: tried with a few of my personal tunes this weekend and this is definitely a keeper!"
254,Uyen Nguyen,"Jan 1, 2022 at 2:08 AM",5,Great experience and no subscription!,"Being able to import our own songs is a huge benefit (thanks, Android?).
The workout generator actually does try fitting the song beat and rhythm to the movements.
My wife found the key is quickly adjusting how much of each motion type she wants for the particular song (punch, squat, etc.). She actually has fun doing this experimental side of the game.
It is also super fun and motivating to be able to build credit to unlock new in-game content."
255,perif,"Jan 5, 2022 at 10:53 AM",5,So far so good.,"I've been using my quest 2 for fitness and the only games I've been playing were beat saber and thrill of the fight. I didn't find beat saber that interesting  and it only gave me a warm up fitness wise. I was looking out for something else to pair with totf and I came across PowerBeatsVr. 

The workouts get really tough! It's also more fun than beat saber at least for me. The graphics aren't so great but I don't care much as long as the gameplay is fun. I see the option to upload custom songs which is a huge plus. I haven't tried that yet. I wish the game also had the balls coming at you which made you jump up to punch though. 

I now play this game with beginner level as warm up, expert for tough workouts, then shadow box with TOTF and cool down with beat saber. I'm happy.
Edit: I find totf hard after doing PowerBeatsVr so I've switched to doing totf first and PowerBeatsVr afterwards"
256,Nate,"Jan 5, 2022 at 8:17 PM",5,Great Fitness App,"Great game, very responsive and provides a great workout.

257,SkyBomb,"Dec 31, 2021 at 12:20 PM",5,Worth every cent!,Awesome game that‚Äôs fun and help you lose weight! Best part is no subscription!!

258,DarkDabula,"Oct 21, 2021 at 8:26 PM",5,New alternative for FitXR,"After I left FitXR because it got a subscriber model, I searched for an alternative. By accident I stumbled over PowerBeatsVR.

So far I can tell its a great fitness app. I use weights on my wrists and although I am not untrained even the beginner level of the tracks let me sweat. I use the app on my Oculus Quest 1 and I have nothing to complain about.

The songs are great and you even can import your own music. If you dont like the generated tracks for your own music, you can use the built-in editor to change/recreate them.

Some minor whishes for improvement:
- The lobby should orientate to where the Oculus menu is
- Sound in the lobby dont change on head movement (lone runner always on the left side)
- Scrolling through lists with the thumbsticks would be nice
- Maybe more stuff to unlock to keep the motivation up

Hopefully the developers wil not make the same mistake like FitXR with a subscription model."

I also like the songs that come with it, great layouts for competition.  I switched over to this native quest version, playing via link before and it was well worth it.

One-time purchase, multiple environments to choose from, and I can add my own music. I LOVE IT!

I'm out of shape, overweight, and never exercise. I sit at a desk job, working from home since 2008. I hate exercise for the sake of exercise. I became interested in the Oculus Quest specifically hoping to find something that I enjoy to get me in shape without feeling like exercising. PowerBeats VR is that app!

274,Parri Davis,"Dec 27, 2021 at 4:08 AM",5,Excellent in a lot of ways.,"Very easy to navigate and get started. The tracks in the ap list the beats per minute, you can choose the pace you want and you can turn off the music altogether. You can also select downloaded music instead, within the ap.

So, first I can use Spotify or whatever other source of music from my phone with earbuds, still not need to purchase music or bother with a computer at all. And change up the music as much as I want to spontaneously. If I want to take my time picking out the music I can carefully match bpm to the game's tracks (which I am using with the sound turned off.)

Also, it is really a goodlooking game, four settings: Clouds, desert, medieval, and Space.

It provides detailed stats on performance on the game and exercise, squats, calories, etc. I can see improvement or backsliding.  

I'm not noticing any glitching. I bought it on sale and I won't have to keep buying sound packs."
275,Cecelia,"Feb 15, 2022 at 5:40 PM",4,,This is the most underestimated work out app. It gets you moving fast. The downstrokes are a little awkward though. Well worth the purchase and use of it.

The only issue so far is that I can't enable the fitness bit, like calories burnt.  It says 'off' and cannot be toggled to 'on'; this makes me sad as I do like to be able to get smug about my calorie usage.

And there‚Äôs a classic example of customer service not reading a message.  üôÑ. Good job it worked the next time I booted the game up."
278,DAZ,"Dec 26, 2021 at 4:32 AM",5,Really good game,Plenty of interesting variations to keep the challenge level up.  Well built mechanics.  Can interchange hand strikes and get a little boxing feel to the game.  Good encouragement as you go along.  Competes well with similar games. Eventually when music playlist goes up this will be one of the better active workouts.
279,bvid,"Dec 26, 2021 at 12:35 AM",5,Solid workout without a subscription,"This is a great game/workout app. The normal setting isn‚Äôt particularly challenging, but in the advanced modes, it turns into a pretty good cardio workout. It feels a little more like working out than a game like beat saber, but much less like a workout than going for a jog or doing jumping jacks!"
280,Gergo,"Oct 23, 2021 at 9:57 PM",5,Good workout app,"Not as much fun as modded Beat Saber with my own music. It doesn't have such refined maps as Audio Trip. 

It's more like the late FitXR which was destroyed this spring when they joined the evil forces of the dreaded subscription model and became infinitely expensive.

PowerBeatsVR provides good exercise to your own music without modding or search for custom maps.

What the screen recordings and screenshots don't show you how amazing the environments are. Unlike similar apps, these are not 360 photos, but true, 3D environments.

The punches are very satisfying, the combos provide quite a lot of variety in motion and the best implementation of squats and dodges! 

They could improve with global challenges, more (and randomized?) environments, and maybe even a handful of 15-20 minute playlists (""classes"") to save first time users from needing to create our own playlists.  

It would be best if the app had 14 half-hour playlists out of the box, so I could just rotate them day to day.  I will eventually have to create these for myself, but it is going to be a lot of work. 

Highly recommended!"

283,AndrewWarren,"Jan 4, 2022 at 4:38 PM",5,Great app,"Really enjoying this, makes working out fun and I hate working out. Fun to use just as a game but even better that you can lose a few calories.

286,ewartuen,"Jan 12, 2022 at 1:21 AM",5,The best body fitness game on Quest!,The best thing you can do is having your flavor songs played in the game instantly after beat detection. It does not require any subscriptions like others. I sweat after playing half song. Works pretty well.
287,909Smalls,"Jan 6, 2022 at 5:03 AM",5,Great fitness VR!,Love using PowerBeats!  It is such a workout and the fact that I don‚Äôt have a subscription is awesome!  Hope it gets moved out of app lab to oculus store where it deserves to be.  Can‚Äôt wait to see how it keeps getting improved.
288,Shai,"Jan 13, 2022 at 7:12 AM",4,Excellent workout,"I was looking for something to get my heart rate up for a good cardio workout. 

At first, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was actually doing much, that was until I started to feel the beads of sweat starting to fall. 

I especially love the ability to use my own music. 
I tend to cycle through the playlists and having my own tracks adds a lot of variety. 

I also really like having a calorie counter in the app as it gives me an approximate target to hit each workout. 

If you are looking for a workout app that doesn‚Äôt require a subscription, look no further than this app. 
It‚Äôs a really fun way to burn some calories."
289,Koosh,"Dec 24, 2021 at 12:59 AM",5,Just started but wow is it good,"Bought this on sale and it‚Äôs worth every penny and then some.  I got some wrist weights on amazon and wear them while playing.  

Such a fun workout experience and great cardio.  With the weights added my arms get a workout also.

I haven‚Äôt tried making custom exercise routines yet or uploaded custom music but I like that you can.

AND NO SUBSCRIPTION.  Great job devs!  You are gonna add years to my life"

The only disadvantage in this game is a soloplay, would be more fun with friends."

Powerbeats is there so I spend the most time with because it hits that sweet spot of different muscle groups while giving you a good sweat inducing weight. If you think that app subscriptions are too expensive, this app gives you the best bang for your buck."
295,Stephane Briere,"Nov 28, 2021 at 10:31 PM",5,Incredible port,"I already have this Workout App. on PC, but was waiting to be able to play it from inside my Quest 2, natively without the need of my PC. And I can tell you, it's the same great application, allowing you to upload your own music to train on with the Auto-Generator, and still be able to edit the generated content if you want it easier or harder. I bought it on both platforms and I really suggest you to buy it, you won't regret. This is the app that will bring new fresh air in the current offer on Quest. It offer a lot of control over what you like or are able to do, like if you have knee pain, you can disable squats, if you don't like walls, disable them, want smaller targets, no problem. And if you are an artist, you can make the most beautiful training visual ever with the editor (I did...). The devs have always been reachable on Discord (since PC version) and are listening to us. You can reach them, make suggestions.  I would like to make it a gift for my friends, but I have to wait that it's in the main store since App Lab don't seem to support gifting softwares yet."

299,Bitbat,"Dec 20, 2021 at 7:17 PM",5,Amazing game. I have so much fun with it,"This game is amazing for workouts and much more with its easy setup and wide range of flexibility & playstyle options. The mechanics are simple, and understandable. My favorite feature of the game is the custom song feature; using your song and AI, the game will GENERATE a unique map for you with twists and turns at every angle. The environments are realistic, and it's a nice trip back to Y2k with the style of the game. What's great about this, is there are options for those with disabilities as well to disable certain challenges, without punishing you in any way. My last favorite thing is the weapon choices. These range from various playstyles that unlock with playing and exercising. Very satisfied with this game. Amazing work team."
300,Thunderbecca,"Dec 20, 2021 at 6:07 AM",5,Must have rhythm game!,"The environments are fun. I like the different modes (beginner, advanced.

304,Rich,"Jan 7, 2022 at 2:03 PM",4,Excellent fitness app with custom songs,"Purchased this after trying beat sabre and synth riders but finding their incorporation of custom tracks a bit fiddly.

Really promising game...nice variety of obstacles, combining elements of the above 2 games, and custom songs couldn't be easier... just drop in a folder and let it do the rest.  There's still scope to adjust to suit but I've not explored more.

Also nice elements for calorie targets and level progression, thanks Devs."

315,JackDiddley,"Jan 8, 2022 at 2:04 AM",3,Shows Potential But Needs Some Work,"The major selling point for this seems to be not having a subscription.  I only own one app that offers a subscription and the subscription service was added after I bought it.  

That being said, as a fitness experience the sessions need to be longer than 3 minutes.  I don't want to have to break up the routine picking a song every 3 minutes or so.  

I love rhythm games and none of them have ever had me banging my controllers together like this one does.  They need to widen the space and make the movement more fluid, less jerking around.  Why are all the double rails side by side where the controllers are almost touching?

I like the environments and the offer of using my own music as the included music is uninspired.  I used to have an app like that but then they removed that feature and added a subscription so I deleted it. 

I'll be watching for updates on this one, but I can't play it or recommend it until I know my controllers are safe."
316,Sharon5,"Jan 21, 2022 at 7:58 PM",5,This is my number ONE go to app,Out of all the apps that I have on my VR this is my go to app it‚Äôs so much fun and gives me a great work out.
317,Wasim Qamar,"Jan 4, 2022 at 10:55 PM",4,No subscription!,"No fuss, no subscription, custom songs support. 

This is a very interesting work out app and has become my main fitness driver. Custom song support is good but still a bit of hit and miss on auto detect. That is one area I would love to see some improvements on. Other than that, best value for money."
318,Mickey,"Nov 29, 2021 at 10:08 PM",5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I have been searching for a music app that will get me up and moving, allows me to customize the content by adding my own music, configures the experience automatically to my music, and has great graphics for better visual effects. I purchased a few apps that promised this but didn‚Äôt pull through. The apps either wouldn‚Äôt read my content, the game play was clunky, visual effects and beat timing was off, I had to download music from the apps web site for custom content, and one had everything I wanted except I had to choreograph the content to the app (which was too complicated to be bother doing). 
Powerbeats does everything I wanted and a little more. The app choreographs to my music automatically and what makes it even better is that I can change the choreography very easily in edit mode. There isn‚Äôt any complex controls to learn. I absolutely love and recommend this game. Best of all is that it‚Äôs cheaper than most of the games of it‚Äôs type out there!  I‚Äôm hoping since the game is still in development that more themes will be available in the future."
319,Ayyyy,"Jan 12, 2022 at 10:46 AM",5,Quick and fun workout,Love what they done with custom songs as you can simply download whatever songs you like and have work out to their beat. Best workout app for the price!
320,technostrator,"Jan 6, 2022 at 2:33 AM",3,Great when judged against the comp.,"I marked this as 5 stars but I‚Äôve only played through 40 minutes of songs so far. 

My first impressions are great, no on-going subscription should be all I have to write but I also really like that it allows for a lot of customization. I tried Supernatural and having some random person talk in my ear without the ability to silence them was a deal breaker. This game allows you to mute all the extra sounds and just flow to the music without distraction. 

Another thing is being able to easily add in your own music and create playlists that you can quickly start up and go for as long as you want it to. You just need to click the endurance mode selection and the songs play back to back.

There are custom songs I like in Beat Saber that have better mapping of course but you are mostly at the mercy of what others have added, which seems to be mostly j/k pop. Here I can add the actual music I want to workout with just by dropping it into a folder, even flac‚Äôs. I do wish there was a deeper setting that would spend more time doing heavier analysis as it generates so fast but isn‚Äôt always matching the beat. I haven‚Äôt had that euphoric Jedi sense I get sometimes from Beat Saber but I feel this is more of a workout so far, not a lot of flicking wrists. 

I also don‚Äôt feel like the Beat Saber barriers do a good job of making you do squats but this is fantastic in that regard as it gives you more space to hit and your not swinging a saber through the barrier to hit the cube as you duck if that makes sense. 

It‚Äôs still really early but I hope there is more variety in the strike patterns as there are different themed levels but I‚Äôve played two so far and it was just a reskin of the first. I think I unlocked all the levels and extra‚Äôs in the first 40 minutes but I could be wrong. 

Looking forward to future development and I hope not going to a subscription model is a defining future benefit leading to increased overall sales."
321,McBortimus,"Oct 22, 2021 at 5:25 AM",5,Just what I was looking for,A great fitness app without a subscription.  I'm 52 and out of shape and have been having fun.

334,Blaakimusprime,"Dec 29, 2021 at 8:27 PM",4,Pretty Nice but....,I purchased the program right off when I heard you can use your own music.  I don't like the game aspect of it though. They need to move it more towards being a full exercise program. Give me everything I need to exercise at one point. The hammers(bats) etc etc.  I wish the scenes where more realistic. The created scense for some reason cause me to be a little dizzy. I don't get that with actual photos or pictures.  Also when I create a play list after each song is finished the scenery should change. It starts to get boring when your looking at the same screen and I don't want to stop my exercise to switch the scene.  Also give people the option on if they want to crouch or not.  I have knee issues crouching is not something I wish to do. All and all this program has tremendous potential.

346,Jeff,"Dec 22, 2021 at 2:58 AM",4,"Has potential, needs better algorithm","This is one of the better workout apps, but the beat generator for local songs could use some work. It continues to throw balls at you even when the track has ended and is entirely quiet, and the rhythm is always a bit off in any song that's not plain 4/4. The announcer's constant chatter (NICE!, GODLIKE!) gets annoying quick but I assume you can turn that off. 

The prepacked music is mostly mediocre. So I have trouble finding something I like playing right now.

This game definitely works out your whole body, and the frequency of squats, leans and lunges is definitely welcome. But it needs some polish to be my main workout app"

I did encounter a case where the game could use quite a few mp3s I uploaded and I couldn't really understand why, which is unfortunate. 

To anyone who starts out and not in amazing shape - I would recommend using the beginner mode, as this is not an easy game, and on advanced it is quite fast for me.

359,LetoDK,"Oct 30, 2021 at 9:06 PM",3,Has potential,"The game has potential, but needs work. If the devs have the wisdom to focus on critical constructive feedback, then this game can be a hit.

- This is the only game besides Eleven Table Tennis that doesn't know how to use the Oculus recentering button as intended. They claim it's to micromanage your ""sAfEtY"", but that's a fundamentally broken and disrespectful approach. I had to use workarounds to even be able to use the game, so their misuse of the recentering system made it less safe for me, and just more frustrating.

- The graphics are rough. The textures are gritty and look outdated. It's lacks appealing aesthetics. It needs a complete visual overhaul in order to have a cohesive visual language, and to become pleasant and seducing to look at.

- There are too few environments

- The sound system is fundamentally broken, which is disappointing for a rhythm game, because they should have audio nailed. For example, when you start a song, there's a very loud sound, that doesn't obey the ""sfx volume"" slider. ALL sfx sound files should be tagged in a way so they ALWAYS obey that slider. This situation hint at lack of proper understanding, or at least handling of digital sound. The audio I mentioned even clips a bit, creating unintended distortion. Big red flag. The person in charge of audio needs to be very very comfortable with digital audio, dynamics etc.

- In a rhythm game, we expect every single hit marker in every single song (along with their sound effects) to be exactly on their correct beat, but this sadly is not the case. In some of the songs, the markers are not on beat. This is completely unacceptable. The person in charge of beat mapping has to have a high sense of musicality. This should never happen.

- It lacks some more customization options.

- A lot of the included songs are.. not great.

- Lacks multiplayer.

- The ""streams"" are boring and have a too small detection radius.

All in all it lacks polish. It feels like a prototype. And yes, I realize that the studio has worked on the game for a long time. Just because a game is released, it doesn't mean that it's actually finished.

Good luck to the devs."

Update: after playing a few days there's one major issue we cannot overcome.Need help. I bought Powerbeats VR and loved it however major issue. I am sharing the app with my girlfriend. When she plays on her headset, it does not save or accumulate her experience so she is consistently stuck at the lowest level of level 1. No matter how much she plays, her experience doesn't increase at all. That does not happen on my headset as I've already gone past experience level 2. Why is she stuck at level 1 still? She has played it more than I have. Very frustrating.

372,Pomme,"Dec 15, 2021 at 12:12 AM",4,Great cardio workout for no subscription,"PowerBeats VR is a great addition to the catalogue of VR cardio based fitness games on the Quest. You have access to a bevy of songs around over an hour total each with varying difficulty settings to pace your workouts the way you please. If that's not enough you have the option to import your own MP3s into the game and it will automatically generate the workout to your liking. The customizability is enormous and one of the main selling points of the game in my opinion. Once you've selected a song to workout to you're transported to one of four different arenas. Originally made for PCVR, the graphics in this iteration are a spectacular showcase of what the Quest is capable of when optimized. You first start with the standard fists as your boppers of choice, but as you workout you gain experience which is used to unlock new weapons like hammers, shields, and power fists, though they need a tad bit more work in order to be implemented in the game in a smoother fashion. The workouts themselves can get extremely intense with some songs, sometimes to the point of discombobulation with the amount of stuff flying at you. All in all though, this is definitely a great game if you're looking for fitness but aren't willing to pay a subscription. Hopefully PowerBeats VR will have a lot more updates to come to make it the creme de la creme of cardio fitness games out on the market."

375,YiboYiboYibo,"Oct 21, 2021 at 4:26 AM",5,Awesome addition to my workout program,"I had my eye on this since I first learned of it. From the videos it looked like an inexpensive alternative to Supernatural and the sort of gameplay that matched my favorites--AT, X-Booster, etc. Was not disappointed! I've done two half-hour sessions so far and I'm loving it. 

First off, I love the backgrounds. Feels nice and airy, so it's a good change of pace from the neon, club-like settings of most fitness apps (I love them, too, but variety is great.) And these scenes are beautiful in addition to giving me a sense of space and outdoors.

Gameplay-wise, it's very satisfying. The punching is fun and the targets move around and force me to move around, too. There's heavy squat work which is excellent. You will be bobbing up and down like a fiend. And I really like that the maps are significantly different. In each song you'll do different slashing moves, punching, dodging, and you'll do them from a variety of positions. So it feels a bit like you're playing a couple of different types of games in one. The AI encouragement is unexpectedly nice, too. 

You will need to fiddle with the settings to get them right for you. The speed was an issue for me initially until I lengthened the forward/backward distance. I need to figure out an optimal height to avoid the balls stacking on each other in front of my face. Right now I'm leaning to the side so I can see the balls coming but there's probably a better solution.

The custom mapping system is quick and easy. You can customize which features show up and the beats per minute. I like that you increase or decrease the number of streams, walls, etc. Not sure that the mapping feels all that coordinated with the beats, but honestly I'm so focused on all the things flying at me that I hardly care. There's a lot to pay attention to! But that's what makes it feel so lively and fresh.

Overall, this is an excellent addition to my fitness games collection and one I'll be using daily. Thank you for making this non-subscription!"

Gives me a decent arm workout while absolutely murdering my legs. Don‚Äôt be fooled by staying on beginner difficulty for too long. Super customizable and fantastically easy to auto-generate maps for custom songs. 

I love that it shows me my punching speed in real time and has a squat counter, and I appreciate the voiceover feedback. The different environments are cool (I‚Äôm not fussy about graphics; I just like the variety). Would be cool to see more environments over time and the ability to customize colors of the orbs or mix/match assets from the different environments. Unlockable skins would be fantastic too.

X-Booster is the only game on Quest that comes close, but this one is simply a much better workout. The ‚Äúleg day‚Äù aspect of Pistol Whip has finally come to another subgenre of Quest gaming."

380,SlackingGekko,"Nov 17, 2021 at 2:38 PM",5,This will make you sweat!,"I'm really enjoying PowerbeatsVR. Before I realized it is natively available for the Quest2 I bought this on Steam and played it using Oculus AirLink. There's a little bit of latency due to AirLink but it's very playable as you can easily adjust to the lag.

Anyhow, you start it up, select a nice tune (you'll be very quickly resort to your own music files as the built-in ones are not my cup of tea) and off you go. The Beginner mode is great to get you warmed up. So far most of my sessions where on the Advanced mode which is surprisingly demanding!
What I like most is that it's relatively fast paced and leaves you with a rewarding feeling if you have dodged a wall or slammed those balls as hard as you can.
The environments are nice and themed consistently, although it would be nice to have the ability to create your own theme or environment.

Anyhow, just buy it and get moving ;)

396,Zathrix,"Oct 21, 2021 at 8:50 PM",5,Custom Music + Hard Workout = Must Have,"This VR title gets me drenched.  With custom songs, a superb auto map generator, and max difficulty -- the gameplay is workout heaven!  Because the result is intense maps that had me laughing and hooting as I tried to hit and dodge the insane stuff being thrown my way, all to music I love.  The motion required is akin to slalom skiing mixed with boxing and swimming, where you swing your arms and sway your body to negotiate the slopes but also punch and add strong, coordinated, alternating arm movements.  You need smooth, quickly coordinated sweeping full body motions to hit the orbs and get out of the way of incoming barriers.  It's different than anything out there - I added this to my workout roundup which includes TOTF, Audio Trip, Synth Riders, Pistol Whip, Oh-Shape, SuperNatural, FitXR, and Blaston.  I'd love to see some added polish - like better collision and sound effects, better maps, and more gamification.  Probably because there aren't a lot of effects when you hit the orbs and the sound effects just don't ""pop"", there isn't that high level of satisfaction that comes with taking care of objects as there is in, say, FitXR. Specifically for the maps, they are right in the middle of photo realistic and VR virtual game, and some of the textures are a bit like old Photoshop auto-generated clouds on certain maps (the walls!), and on certain stages the sunlight is just a bit too orange, so you end up feeling like you are standing in an early 90s sim game when the graphics cards just couldn't produce something more realistic.  Anyhow, would love to see more polished outdoor themes or some more neon type themes ala Synth Riders or newer themes in Oh-Shape (their early themes were not great, either -- but their DLC themes are money!).  Overall, this is an outstanding, unique game that you should get for your VR fitness workout.  You're welcome."

The only issue is with the darn trails - please add the option to get rid of them. After a good hitting streak I want to keep going and not to wave my hands for 16 bars to follow some silly ribbon. It's a serious buzzkiller and is unnecessarily long.

Fantastic game with custom songs and a super cool built-in editor.

It has elements of Supernatural and Synth Riders (my two favorites thus far) but both of those do what they do so well, it‚Äôs hard for one game to replace them. That said, if subscription services are a no-go for someone, this is an excellent alternative.

Where I think PowerBeatsVR stands out is the room to grow and expand with different weapons, song choices, environments, and options that make it unique. So it doesn‚Äôt replace the others, but will now be one of my 3 go-to fitness games. 

To the developers: I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but I have trouble seeing the rails, even when given warning, until they are right in my face. I tried different environments and still an issue.

423,Nigel Senior,"Oct 21, 2021 at 1:00 AM",5,First session but really good,"I am a bit short sighted (can't be fixed with glasses) so I like to clearly see things coming in the distance. This does it really well. It's got an arcade feel which makes it more comfortable. Lots options, variety of music store. The game moves you a lot so it's not just a puncher, great airobic and stretch. Good fun so far."
424,Moxxie,"Oct 23, 2021 at 7:30 AM",5,"Non-subscription, can add your music","My elliptical is now a $1200 drying rack.  Why would I ever trudge along to mere music or watch TV when I can dodge, dance, and punch to whatever tunes I'm into this week?   Subscription, subsmidgeon . . . all those money-grubbing fitness apps can go walk a duck.   This app rocks!"
425,Elaine,"Oct 20, 2021 at 8:22 PM",4,New favorite,"I think I've tried all the rhythm games. This comes closest to X-Booster, my previous favorite. The graphics here are much prettier and I actually like the included songs (still, custom songs is appreciated too -- as is no subscription!). I like that there aren't arrows telling you what direction to punch in and you can go with what feels natural. It's also very satisfying to upper cut a rock and see the debris soar into the atmosphere, like I'm Thor! (In fact, just as I was thinking Thor's hammer would be a cool weapon to have, I got the encouraging word ""GODLIKE!"" across the screen.) After 30 minutes I'm dripping sweat, which is exactly what I'm paying for. 

I had one weird bug where I tried to generate a map for a custom song and got a ""this song already has a (something, I forget what it said). Do you want to override?"" message. Then nothing I did would let me play any songs, not even the included ones, and I had to reboot the game. 

Probably my biggest complaint (and not really a complaint, hardly a deal breaker) is the strange decision to make every single ball worth the same amount of points no matter how hard you hit, even the ""special"" ones. I experimented and it's a nice touch that just tapping them results in less debris, so clearly the game can detect how much force is being used. Is there a setting I'm missing? Because if everything is worth the same amount of points, what's my motivation to hit harder? (other than to feel like Thor?) 

Otherwise loving this so far!"
426,„Åó„Åæ,"Nov 2, 2021 at 4:29 AM",4,I'm looking forward to it in the future.,"One of the good options for those looking for a boxer size app.
Non-subscription boxer size apps have this and X-BOOSTER, but both have their pros and cons.
I hope that it will be improved in future updates.

ÔΩ•Hand modeling is not stylish.
ÔΩ•The timing of the hit sound is slightly delayed.
ÔΩ•I want a variation in the hit sound.
ÔΩ•I feel that the collision detection of obstacles is a little too strict.
ÔΩ•The front of the play space can only be adjusted by rotating 90 degrees."
427,MOKENTROLL,"Oct 21, 2021 at 8:04 PM",4,Just another boxing style beat game,"This was marketed as a ‚Äúfitness‚Äù game so, naturally I assumed it would be categorized into various workout segments. I was expecting 20 minute workouts that focused on cardio or HIIT, similar to Fitxr. This only offers 3 minute games. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it IS a workout. But I don‚Äôt want to have to stop every 3 to 5 minutes to pick another song/game. It messes up the flow. It‚Äôs essentially just Beat Saber with the option to add your own music, which is awesome if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into. It also has very nice graphics and interface, again just not what I was looking for."
428,AMW,"Nov 2, 2021 at 4:59 PM",5,Best Boxing / Fitness Game for Quest,Waited so long for this game to release and it is really better than FitXR and also has no subscription model etc... You can add custom songs and customize your workout. Really amazing !
429,philius99,"Nov 1, 2021 at 1:20 AM",4,Great Promise,"This game definitely gets you moving side to side and squatting to avoid obstacles.

I think the actual boxing aspect could do with some improvement....

1. It is completely unnatural and illogical to strike with both fists at once - ideally should be left/right every time so you can shift your weight properly

2. Striking while squatting also makes no sense - when would you punch someone in the shins? Should be a squat then an uppercut-style strike to make it feel more natural.

As I said, great promise to get the heart pumping and burn a few calories while having fun just some of the moves feel unnatural."
430,Dr oculus,"Nov 2, 2021 at 8:43 PM",5,Should be oculus store,"This is a fantastic port of the pc version, runs flawlessly on quest 2 and such a great addition to any fitness fanatic or those that like to have fun and shake what ya momma gave you"
431,Yon Macklein,"Dec 19, 2021 at 5:21 PM",4,good exercise and good game,a great game to add to your weekly exercise routine
432,ItsBalloon,"Oct 20, 2021 at 4:15 PM",5,Fantastic!!,"I just purchased and played for a few minutes. What a pleasure. I have owned PowerBeatsVR on Steam for quite a while. This port seems to be fantastic so far.
I only wish they gave a discount for previous owners. 
This is a must buy for the Quest."
433,IMALOOZER,"Oct 28, 2021 at 9:26 PM",4,"Great workout, so try it!","I'm a FitXr subscriber or I was until I purchased PowerBeatsVR.

My main reason was, one off cost no subscription, and the best thing was the ability to create custom Playlist from custom songs, and PowerBeatsVR generating the level for you.

FitXr still remains a great workout for some variety but the subscription model and limited song availability are it's downfall.  This is where PowerBeatsVR has its opportunity and I do urge you to try."
434,ED,"Oct 27, 2021 at 11:16 PM",4,One of the best fitness games!,"The concept is awesome and I'm always searching for games that make you sweat! This is one of the most physical intensive games that I've played on the Quest, and with no subscription fee! I love how this game make you squat a lot while I'm having fun! 

But I have some things that I think it should improve:

- The rails is odd... The sound effect seems like the vibration motor of the controller is malfunctioning, I would rather not listen to it. Most of the time it keeps your hands too close and it's kinda ugly, with sharp edges. Something like the rails of Synth Riders and Audica would be better.

- Not having the left and right blocks to punch removes a great part of the challenge and the fun.

- The mapping of the songs is bad. It feels like it was auto generated. It lacks a good flow.

- The songs lacks personality. I appreciate the amount of songs, but this tracklist is one of the worst among the VR rhythm games.

- The different kinds of ""gloves"" is interesting, but it doesn't add much to the gameplay

- Achievements would be a great way to keep players engaged and playing this game.

- Some visual special effects matching the song would improve the fun."
435,Butchbeata,"Nov 8, 2021 at 1:11 PM",5,Awesome boxing game,Very good workout great graphics great adjustability many options very fun and quite addicting way to go developers.
436,Jack Tripper,"Oct 21, 2021 at 2:08 PM",4,"Cool, It Rocks","This app is cool and put a strain on my fragile 50 year old heart!
 I have tried some advanced and expert difficulty tracks and I must say that they offer pleasant songs and intense and fun workouts, a mix between Synth Ryders (more lysergic) and FitXR (perhaps too technical). 

And then guys, Pour Your Sugar on Me rocks badly, and the heartbeats go up, as it happened in the early 90's when this song was shot from the car radio!"
437,WutParadox,"Oct 28, 2021 at 3:32 PM",5,Loving it!,Excellent workout that forces me to use my whole body throughout. I love being able to use my own music! I'm sweating and exhausted when I'm done so 5/5
